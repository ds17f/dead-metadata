And then to see the people hand-in-hand dancing around the concourse during the \"Wheel\" --- when had that ever happened??

I started by listening to the songs from the other copy. I could tell the boys were hitting it right espcially for the first set, but I just could not get into the audiance tape. So, I gave this copy a try and about fell out of my chair; totally blown away! The recording is a bit bright and in places the mix has Jerry's guitar toned down too much, but even with that this is a stellar performance. Maybe the best Sugaree or at least on par with my favorite of 12-28-79.  This first set is one of the strongest I've heard.",

But for the most part I never found a show that rivalled that best from the '70s, until now that is. This show is amazing. Folks have said that this Sugaree is the best, I don't know about that but I always thought the Dead never nailed that song until about 1979 and boy do they nail it here. But how about Bird Song? OMFG! and Deal is, and I can't believe I'm saying this, the best version I've ever heard bar none. Jerry and company just wail. Too bad this stream is only of the 1st set because if the second set is as good this would be the best Dead show from the eighties I've heard. The energy is sky high, Bobby's rhythm, Bill and Mickey, and the man Jerry are playing with a power and swagger they rarely matched during this time period and let's not forget Brent and Phil who are both spot on. Would someone tell me why this wasn't a Dick's Pick? The one from '83 Vol.6 is weak and really sloppy. By comparison, well there is no comparison.",

I had never (nor have ever) seen everyone dancing hand in hand around a concourse. Truly everyone plaiying in the heart of gold band for a few minutes that seemed eternal.

One of those shows that you don't hear a lot about, just like the Boyz in general; our secret. \n\nThere were the 2 Stephens we were all so high on at the time, but this was our Family show in that small arena where 'the miracle' happened in 1980.

Since my sister and all of her friends were going and half the town, I decided I would get a ticket too. I was a local kid so I knew the ticket lady and she hooked me up with a floor seat, 10 or 11th row i think. The day of the concert, I couldn't remember where I had hidden my ticket. With no ticket in hand, I just walked to the show anyway. The parking lot next to Mirror lacked was packed with heads. I actually saw a couple making love on the roof of their ca As I was only 12 at the time, I was blown away. I listened to the show behind the Olympic Arena (now the Herb Brooks Olympic Arena) on the steep hill out back. We used the neighboring woods as a local party spot. I spent my first show sharing a beer-ball with some local friends and some adopted heads hanging out listening to the dead play-on inside while we got drunk and watched the stars. \nThis is the first board of have heard of that show.
