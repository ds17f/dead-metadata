The only show where Mickey had the drums to himself and it's like looking into an alternate universe, one with improvisational guitars propelled by straight ahead, driving drums cruising through the void left by limited keyboards on Dark Star from Pigpen. According to Deadbase, this show is the day before TC joined the Dead. The Dark Star is free with keyboards kept in the background, but focused.",

The concert itself is the finest document one could hope for in from this distant era.  It's, of course, nothing releasable, since it is a 1969 audience recording, but the band is clearly right-on target, heavily inspired, and start-to-finish, energized.  High point of the times, perhaps.  Amazing how much they changed just a few months later, with Jerry discarding some of his trademark runs and the band discarding songs that defined the psychedelic era for them.  The long strange trip takes off from here.",

Jerry is on fire, his guitar snarling and caressing at the same time. the drummers are crunching out the groove as if their lives depended on it - mickey gesturing after each backbeat, and billy grimly holding the groove close to home. the tune builds to its harrowing climax; jerry screams out the final line - 'i guess it doesn't matter anyway' - and we hammer home the final chords. \n\njerry looks over at me, and i give him a 'way to go, man' grin. most of the time, we don't use set lists - usually whoever wants to sing a song will call it - so Pig calls 'schoolgirl' and we go from there......(phil, searching for the sound p.139)",

So I can shed some light on this event. First, Micky and Bill both performed on drums.\n\nSecond, I think Phil's estimate of the audience size was a little high, I'd say there were roughly 200 people in attendence.\n Also if you listen carefully to the very end of the final song (we bid you goodnight) you can hear someone beginning to say \"We found a place. . .\"\n\nEarlier in the concert, a member of the band (And I'm sorry I don't recall which one) told the audience that the security at Veterans Memorial told the Dead they had to cut their performance off or they would close the security doors. That would have meant the Dead's equipment would have been locked inside. The Dead also asked the audience if anyone knew of a place they could reconvene to continue playing. Well someone did and indeed the Dead did move lock stock and barrel to another venue to continue playing until sunup.\n\nOne last thing. I cannot swear to it, but I am pretty certain the obnoxious whistling during applause came out of my mouth. So, nearly forty years later, may I now appologize?",

      "review_text": "Notes Just a couple notes on this show. Great playing, poor sound. It seems to improve a bit in Lovelight but remains muddy. The Dead played this venue in '68, '72, and '78. For some reason Deadbase lists a different venue name for each show, but Veterans Memorial Auditorium is correct and should be listed for all three. I graduated from high school in this Auditorium in 1990 just before Brent's untimely passing. Wasn't yet born when this show happened. Its surprising to read there were so few people at this show. Although Columbus was pretty conservative in 1968 compared to the coasts, and the Dead were likely somewhat unknown, this was the night before the legendary OSU-Michigan game - a traditional party night. A campus show would likely have fared much better. The Bucks would win 50-14 and go on to win both the Rose Bowl and National Championship taht year. Its interesting that Phil comments on this show in his book and mentions both drummers, but most sources indicate Billy was absent. It sure sounds like one drummer to me, and this show smokes, no doubt. A time machine show for sure.",

But a top-notch Morning Dew, a Dark Star from the golden age of Dark stars (late summer \u201968 \u2013to- mid/late \u201969), and Jerry rips into everything.
