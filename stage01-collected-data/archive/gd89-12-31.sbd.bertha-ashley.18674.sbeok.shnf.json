(Help-slip-frank, Death Don't, We Bid You, Attics, and Dark Star)  However, even that night we knew some segments had smoked, and over time I realize that they played some great stuff this night.  Set 1 Opened with the New Years Favorite Sugar Mag>Women Are>Touch ( is this the 2nd set?).  Then we got Bonnie Raitt with a sweet slide on Big Boss, and strong set closers in Memphis Blues and Shakedown.  Set 2 had Taro Hart on Drums with Dad for a rocking Aiko, and still one of the spookiest Victum or the Crime's, with a great ending Jam and then the quiet wind down to the moment of truth, the Dark Star, which was very hot.  Out of Space the Fantasy blows off hte roof, and the momentum carriers right through the GDTRFB.  After that the versions are well played if a little un exciting, a shot mini double encore with a good and rare Midnight Hour.  Overall some great moments, highly reccomended.",

      "review_text": "Hit and Miss Rumour had it at the time that this was going to be Brent's last show because he was too unreliable, too far gone, to do another tour.  He hung in there though through the summer of 90.\n\nThis show, I think, is highly over-rated by the reviewers.  The band had blown the doors off the night before (a must have show!!)  and this show suffers from a feel of overall fatigue particularly in the second set.\n\nThey do come out gangbusters though delivering a nice bunch of second set numbers in the first.  In fact I love this first set which is why I rate the show as high as I do.  Bonnie Raitt's playing on her spots is stellar and I always loved it when Jerry broke out Big Boss.  Closing a set with Shakedown is always a treat but they had played better ones in what was one of the band's greatest years since 1981 (boy I must be pissing a lot of people of right now!).  Still, it's a dance off mofo.\n\nThe second set is a series of misfires, I think. With Victim Or the Crime setting the tone (and shaving everyone's buzz) one of the darkest of Dark Stars is played into Drums.  Actually it's the highlight of the set but what a dark vibe for a New Year's party!  The rest of the set is disappointing.  The encore is the highlight of the second half but they seem somewhat disinterested in giving the crowd the usual meaty N.Y. encore.  Check out the next year when they're back on form and you'll see what I mean.\n\nI don't blame the band for any of this.  The rest of the run is simply incredible.  Check out the Dew they play on the 28th.  I mean they have a right to be tired.  It's been a long year.  And am I imagining it or is that long intro to Fantasy a band waiting for my beloved Brent to get his shit together?  Maybe someone who was there can tell me?",

      "review_text": "I Listened from My Living Room I listened to this show on my FM stereo with speakers roaring in multiplex bloom, got bored with it, went out, listened to it while driving around, went to a friend's party, convinced him to listen to it, we all listened to it while we partied into the new year. Two guys got into a karate-type fistfight with my friend. I walked away from the fight. He was handling himself very well and needed not my involement. There was not too much blood. Then I went home, and on the way I listened to this show on KPFA. When I arrived home it was still playing on my radio, and since I had forgotten to turn the volume down inside my house I could hear it as I pulled into the driveway in the most amazingly austere quad mix twixt the car stereo and what was reverberating out of my place.\nThe cops were there. There were the neighbors all standing around in slippers and bath robes. The cops asked me if I lived there (while the music is just blasting out of my house speakers and my car speakers) I said yes. Everybody was pissed-off and I was mortified that I had driven away and left my stereo blasting. The cops asked me if I'd had anything to drink that night. I did not lie. I was completely sober. Then the cops told everybody to go home and told me to keep it down and I went inside and turned the stereo down and listened to the remainder of the broadcast by myself; completely straight and sober. It was not a particularly good show, nor a particularly merry evening. I do not even recall saying Happy New Year and singing Auld Lang Syne. When I woke up  around noon the FM radio was still blaring away some gibberish about how to plant your winter bulbs. I had tickets offered to me for that show but I did not want to hassle with driving to Oakland. The FM broadcast was quite adequate. It is not a good show by all standards of a good show. It is rather pedestrian. But it speaks of life where there is always a show going on somewhere in the background and depending upon our hearing or our perspective it is all more or less in tune with whatever is shaking down.",

Yes it didn't live up to the high expectations, like so many other NYE shows before it. Victim on New Years Eve?? Loved how Jerry was quoted in an interview saying the song was \" a real smile stopper \" LOL!! But this version was very dark and I found it to be one of the better versions before or since whatever's that worth.... Really thought Dear Mr. Fantasy was a highlight nobody has mentioned. Memphis had a nice B3 solo as well.NYE used to get a 3rd set then that was reduced to a half a set... The 2015 WORLD CHAMPION GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS at the time had a banner that was directly behind the stage that in the teams colors exclaimed \" We came to play \" folks behind the stage were shining flash lights onto it as they took their time coming out for S.S.D.D. Brokedown Palace then left turning on the house lights before relenting and coming back for a second second encore Midnight Hour. It was odd and no doubt wasn't as  celebratory as you would hope a New Years show would be. Still its pretty solid if it were played at any other date. \n\nBTW Evan Hunt your review is awesome!!!",

Only problem, Brent disappears for most of Victim, to resurface for Dark Star; maybe he needed to drink another beer.
