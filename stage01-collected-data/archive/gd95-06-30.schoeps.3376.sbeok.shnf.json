Perhaps one of the better summer shows, not that that is saying much. This show is certainly worth having non the less, if not just for the second set Rain quartet, and the crowd's reaction to it. This recording is a little under average for an AUD, with quite a bit of stadium echo. But I for one kind of like that. You could do a lot worse than download this one!",

Things got hot with the West LA and Candyman and only continued to soar all the way through the Gloria encore.  It actually was not a rainy day at all until set break.  Right before they busted out 'Rain' I remember a huge thunder crackle with some intense lightning.  Just seconds later the boys busted into Rain, almost as if waiting for that moment, and from that point it was on!  The 'Rain' set is always welcome and this was a fine second set (although I'm partial to Deer Creek 7/20/94 with the rain tunes followed by a HC Sunshine and smokin' Corrina>Matilda. Anyway...).  And everyone there will never forget Jerry with purple shirt and singing a heartfelt SOTM with his hair blowing in the cool summer breeze.\n\nWell worth the pickup as an example of what the Dead could still be late into '95. This was not 'the tour from hell' yet as everyone still looked blissfully forward to Deer Creek. I'll break the tie and give it a solid 4 stars.",

And if you weren't there, let me tell you people: This was the night Jerry made it rain.

      "review_text": "RAIN!! WATER!! BUCKETS POURING!!! excellent show for summer 1995. the first set is pretty well played. a nice bucket west LA to open up and jerry sounds refreshed. for me bird song was the first set highlight and promised rocked us into intermission. during the break it started to rain and a few rumbles of thunder. the lights go down and the boys return to the stage. i didnt have a watch but it seemed like 10-15 minuets went by as they tuned up. i could see all the boys smiling like they had something up their sleeve. with the rain already falling the dead stepped up to the mic. at the exact moment they started harmonizing \"rain\", as if on cue, an incredible downpour started. biggest drops i think i have ever saw. BUCKETS of rain. the dead made it happen. it was sick. intense. 3 more rain songs followed and then terrapin station with a killer jam to follow. the rest of the show was great as well and encoring with the first ( and last ) GLORIA since 9-18-93 MSG. what a treat. this quality is pretty good for being in the ocean of rain that was dumped on us. i recomend it to any and everyone. truly one of the last great dead shows. check it out to get the full effect, play it in a shower with multiple shower heads, or jump in your pool and blast it while your under the water. seriously hot rain show. great aud quality. on another note, i was one bad thing happen at this show. during LL rain i went to seek cover from the storm and went up on phils side under the overhang. about midway through LL rain something happened. i herd a scream and saw a body fall past me. at first i thought, nah. no way. then i got up and looked down and it seems that a girl fell off the top level and went straight down to the top of the first level. it made it a little hard to concentrate on the rest of the show and i am curious if anyone out there knows about this, or even if that girl is ok now. i was partying with someone from NJ i think and we both saw it happen.if anyone knows anything about this horrible accident please throw up a line on here.",

This show was my first show since returning from Senegal, where I served in the Peace Corps.  it was a magic night for me wiht many wonderful adventures.  The SOTM is the best I have hear, bar none.

      "review_text": "Dancin in the Rain.... More often than not, it was damn painful seeing the Dead in '95.  We witnessed the inevitable \"end of the road\" at almost every show it seems.  Jerry was sick and mostly uninspired with few exceptions.  Vince made my ears bleed and the only thing worse than a Vince tune was when aliens would kidnap Phil Lesh and make him sing \"Wave to the Wind\".  It still gives me chills and nightmares.  You try not to be a critic, but its tough fooling your ears into hearing the previously experienced majesty of the Deads music when its just not there.  \n\nThat stated, the 3 River Stadium show from '95 was one of the best times I've had at a Dead show.  With exception to the dead guy we saw who overdosed at the hotel, the bolt of lightning that almost electricuted our hacky sack circle, and the fat nude dude who was streaking down the middle of the road, it was a wonderful day.  \n\nI was with good company, 8 good friends, all of us had floor seats, and the lot was full of all kinds of good people.  You have to love Pittsburgh.  Even the shitty weather didnt phase us much.  The local band Rusted Root opened, one of the few opening acts I'd seen who could get an entire stadium up and dancing feverishly.  These guys were amazing.  I was somewhat nervous when the Dead came out, wondering how well Jerry was feeling and if he'd make it through the tour.  The 1st set was notable for its West LA which was very groovy, an incredible \"Take Me to the River\" which had the crowd amped, and a lovely \"Bird Song\".  I say lovely because many of the Bird Songs from 94/95 were more on the wicked, twisted, and evil side.  \n\nWe were getting psyched for the 2nd set when the boys came out.  Almost as if on queue, they opened with the Beatles' \"RAIN\" at the exact same moment the weather came crashing down on us.  It was truly amazing, as though they were controlling the weather.  We were drenched to the bone and simply did not care.  As a matter of fact, being rained on that night during \"Rain\" was fantastic.  The weather was relentless and the music kept us happily wet.  The audience tapes are MUCH better than the boards of this show, mostly because they demonstrate how well the band, music, and heads all blended together so cohesively.  The boards also demonstrate how horrible the singing was, including an assortment of missed lyrics, lots of mubbling, and overall lack of harmony.  This nice audience recording was as I heard it that night, focused on the great music and the joyful crowd, preventing the need to be the critic no one wants to be.  \n\nAfter \"Rain\" all the other Rain related tunes came out, including a nice \"Box of Rain\" with Phil smiling at the crowd, a bummer Samba in the Rain with Vince in his cheddar glory, a standard Looks Like Rain (Bobby just cant stand it!), and a beautiful Terrapin into Drumz.  Who would ever think that \"Standing on the Moon\" would be a good 2nd set closer?  Listen to this version and you'll understand why.  One of my favorite versions of the tune with Jerry going off at the end just the way we liked him to.  \n\nMany shows were plagued in '95, including the deaths at RFK, the horrible accidents in St.Louis, the gate crashes that killed Deer Creek, and the Jerry death threats that bummed everyone out.  A lot of the BS was mostly due to the \"lot rot\" vagabonds without tickets ruining the fun for everyone.  I saw more \"dreadier than thou\" wannabes in '95 begging for tickets in their expensive Columbia jackets, Patagonia backpacks, and brand new Birks, often right in front of their tour-BMWs.  I left more shows bummed than jazzed in '95, and was sad enough to sell my Phil Zone seats for the final show at Soldier Field.  Fortunately, I had my experience at 3 River Stadium, a show I remember as my final night of fun with the boys.  Thanks ARCHIVE for hosting!!!",

That said, the first set was fairly solid, with a nicely jammed Birdsong - at least until Jerry started playing the same riff over and over ala Let It Grow 87-89.  The second set was a major disappointment.  Rain and Box of Rain were fine, but Samba was totally limp compared to 3-17-95, the only other version I'd heard.  When they went into Looks Like Rain, I remember groaning, \"Do they have to play every rain song in their repertoire?\"  The rain had stopped by the start of Samba.  At least the Terrapin was solid, but I Need a Geritol was even worse than usual, played at an ultra slow, lounge tempo.  I felt scandalized, like I'd just been in a strip club.  Fortunately, Standing on the Moon brought some life back, and Gloria had me wondering why they didn't play it out of drums instead of Geritol or (I wish it were)The Last Time.\n\nDon't waste your time with anything from 95 unless it was your last show or something.  Check out 68-70, 72-74, 76-77, or fall 89 through fall 91.  That's the real stuff!\n\nEdited to say:  Keep in mind that I would probably put the best Dave Matthews show ever at a 2 on this scale and a Gwen Stefani show at minus 1000.

I have to say it was not only an energetic performance, but one of the best times on lot that I have had in a while up to that point.  Alot of the guys from Rusted Root (who opened the show) were jammin their asses off under the bridge down by the river, so I brought five or six djembes that I was selling down and let people standin around or dancing tear into em'.  I broke out old betsy, and what followed was probablly the most hypnotic transitory drum circle I've been a part of on the east coast.  People went completely foamin at the mouth freakin bat shit funky.  I thought that would top the evening off, and the boys would have a hard time trying to bring any medicine stronger than that..........I should have known better because I WAS FREAKIN WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  About 10 min before the second set I was right down in the Phil zone about 10 feet away from the stage with my brother,(startin to feel really, REALLY right) and I called that they were going to play Rain from the Beatles.  Either I guessed right or they heard me because as soon as they started belting out RAIN! RAIN! and the rain started comin down I looked over at my brother's big dialated face and a big smile overtook the both of us an we started gettin down in an invoulentary dance that absolutely overtook everyone I saw.  PURE MAGIC.  CLEAN VIBRATIONS.  THE GRATEFUL DEAD.  I think that was the first time that they played all the freakin rain songs in a row.  I THINK IT AMAZED THEM TOO!

I managed to limp to a family friends farm outside of Flintstone & had them drive us to Cumberland (Blues), MD & rent a car.   Traffic was TERRIBLE getting to 3 Rivers.   Meager supply of DANKNESS had me looking EVERYWHERE!!!   But alas, no luck.   Police presence seemed a little thick to me...anyone else?   Watched 3 bacon samiches \"raid\" an RV---sad...\nOur seats were maybe 10-15 rows out from between Phil & Bob---Thanks GDTS!!!   Went to get sustenance & walking back with an ARMFUL of Hot Dogs, a Large drink & a ?pretzel? through the throngs on the floor I came to a bottleneck in one of the isles.   Then, just like Moses parting the Red Sea, the crowd opened up to an empty circle 10ft around me, and laying on the ground at my feet was 1/4oz (at least) of some rather supreme nugs.   I couldn't believe it!!!   Sharing the wealth, my wife & I turned on everyone within 10ft of our seats---then what always seemed to be a great show opener HIAB started, going into WLAFA.   Eventough we'd heard several of the \"Rain\" songs previously At RFK, it was MAGICAL to hear all of these played in the context of this situation---they REALLY did make it rain HARD when breaking out into the Beatles \"Rain\"...   \nWhile others opinions of the bands ability to perform well may vary, I had a GREAT TIME at what I did not know was going to be the last time I'd see The Grateful Dead & Jerry Garcia.   There have been too few \"legends in their own time,\" but Jerry was definetly one of them.   This band still gives me goosebumps when listening to those moments when they turned straw into GOLD!!!\nHappy Birthday Jerry, we miss you immensely!!!\n\n5 STARS for the memories.

The beautiful genius in full decline manages to get off a few good licks in this one but there is a distinct lack of jamming and taking of chances.  That being said it is more listenable in terms of band performance than much of '95 summer tour.  The Terrapin is average.  Drums and Space are great and were often highlights of '95 for me, anyway.  Nice to hear West LA although compared to the blistering versions of years past (I caught a rainswept knockout West LA at Alpine in '89 that damn near blew me off the hill) it merely doesn't suck.\n\nThe sound just ain't great and this is the tape I have had since '95.  I have a recording of the Three Rivers '90 gig that my friend taped that truly rocks so I know what can be done in that stadium even in the rain.  Fact is though, much of the audience recordings from about '92 on were less than stellar and that's being kind. Not unlike the band they were taping.  I know what was up with the band but not the tapers.  What happened?\n\nI'm glad all who were there had such a great time.

I travelled there with all my closest friends and my little, 17 year old brother.  It was hot and sticky, but that didn't deter anything.  All that mattered to me was that I was seeing my favorite band with my best friends.  \nI am getting goose bumps and tears just writing this 12 years later.  The four rain songs into terrapin was awesome.  The standing on the moon was so damn good,  with Jerry singing at the end, and the wind blowing post rain and his projection on the big screens is just something I will never forget.  It was the best concert I have ever been.  I have seen the Dead countless times, Pink Floyd in 94, CS&N, and so many concerts, this is the best one on my list, followed by the Dead at Blossom music center in Ohio in 2004. Both concerts were two of the absolute best times and memories I have to this day.\nThis is one of those shows, if you weren't there, it's nothing special. If you were there, you saw some very special Grateful Dead moments right near there end.",

      "review_text": "it's unfortunate.. the negativity and moaning about this show.  it's a fact the dead weren't what they were in 60s 70s and 80s during 1995.  however, there were moments that brought young and old together in a way no other band could hope to.  i am glad the vast majority hold those moments as sacred and wonderful, and i hope the others that feel the need to post the negativity rethink their motives behind doing so.........\n\nthe timing of the rain and 2nd set has been told well by many...i echo the same excitement and memories.  the kind of memories that make you feel great and sad at the same time.  the kind of memories that give you chills and make your heart ache at the same time.  i will only add a couple more...\n\n1. the terrapin and the rising moon.  as the rain came to a stop earlier in the set, i (maybe 15 feet from front-center) began to see a glowing behind the stage.  as the band went through llr, and began terrapin, the light grew as the moon rose behind the stage.  all of us soaking wet were almost awestruck, i think.  soaking wet, probably cold, but lost in a night only the dead could be a part of.  magical really.  a solid version of the song, not overwhelming, but beautiful in it's simplicity is you listen to the musical interludes during and after.\n\n2.  the blues hit home.  after a relatively tame space, bobby comes out strumming an ultra bluesy miracle.  now, this is a decent recording, but it does lack the depth of phil's bass that my buddy's aud version doesn't.  the miracle may be slow, but if you were at this show, phil's bass rammed through you as he punched the off-beats as if he wanted to turn pittspuke (cleveland fan here) stadium to rubble.  the slowest most bluesy version of this song i've heard.  turn the bass up, and blast this through some decent speakers and enjoy.\n\n3. not to mention gloria...heh heh.\n\n5 stars for the experience................",

She said she wanted to hear Bird Song and I said I hoped for a SOTM (one of the few tunes you could count on being good during this time). We parted ways in the lot but it looks like we both got what we wished for. I initially walked away from this show a little unimpressed due to various factors (poor seats, just saw all of the \"rain\" songs at RFK, etc.). However, I did feel the power in that SOTM (maybe the best of several I witnessed) and the Gloria encore was nice. However, after listening to this show over again in recent years I wish I would have paid a bit more attention. First set is tight with good versions of virtually every tune. Set Two is short on lenghty jams but Garcia plays and sings well and the entire set flows along nicely. Better audience sources of this show exist but I sure would love to find a soundboard!",

You should be grateful that Jerry was around to play these songs EVEN if they were great for only a short peak.  Your an idiot I hope you never get to here another show again!

This is not the same transcendence of earlier years, perhaps.  But on another note, because Jerry hasn't the strength to spare, he plays every moment as though his life depends on it.\n\nFortunately, for this night, the band turns in a great performance start to fin, culminating in SOTM.  \n\nOn another tour, this may be an average show.  But for this tour, it's a great show.  Put in it's historical perspective, this show is awesome.  The band does not hold back one bit, and they play as though they'd been rehearsing.

      "review_text": "ONE AND DONE Though I was born in 1954, I came on the bus rather later in life. I remember the Dead's 1st album and much liked it. Then my brother told me of a show he saw at Ohio Unvirsity in Athens in 1968. Was a free show, they had played in Columbus, Ohio the night before. Turns out this was the 1st Tom Constanten show. My brother told me they played at least 4 hrs. He rembered 2 drummers and 2 keyboards; and he even swears to this day somebody with a tuba was onstage with them too. Alas, no recording of this show has been found. A pity.\n     As for the Three Rivers show, was my 1st and last show. My oldest son and a friend of mine got to the parking lot early, fired up our grill thru the day before and after the show had steaks, shrimp, burgers and plenty of cold beer. We had competeing Nitrous tanks close to the parking spot we had;  and I remember some dudes cracking down on T-shirt selling in the lot. When i spied them after a recent bust, with their hands full of T-shirts, I fake staggered up to them and said, \"Hey man! Are you selling shirts?  Can I buy one?\" They were not amused.\n     Our seats were at the back of the infield, and I remember the sound wasn't great. My son was mesmerized by SOTM, and to this day raves about that version. I enjoyed the raucous sound of Gloria, a suprprise encore.\n     The RAIN start of the second set was neat, and when we got back to the lotI had wisely brought a change of clothes and a towe, I simply undressed in front of the crowd, dried off and fired the grill back up. We didn't leave the lot til 4am.\n     Contrary to others who remind that this should be only a \"music\" review, I disagree. Having devoured everything I can read about the Dead since that 1st and only concert, it is obvious that the \"whole\" experience was essential to the show, and more importantly to the band.\n     I claim no objective review of either the recording or the experience. Was simply a divine event for me, my son and my friend.",

Many more details were lost in the attic of my mind among the dead dreams from another day. But listening to the show again brings a flood of memories pouring back. \n\nWe hopped into the 1975 Orange VW poptop immediately after graduation at UCLA and headed east for summer tour. Who knew it would be our last? The maintenance history of my bus was a lot like Jerry's history of checking in and out of rehab. Seems like we were all on our last legs by the time we made it to Pittsburg. Grateful to be the there, but weak and tired at the same time.\n\nAnd hot. So damned hot. Everybody talks about the rain set, of course. But do you remember how gruelingly hot it was that day? Hot and sticky and muggy as fugg. California kids aren't used to that east coast humidity, and it was a shock to my system. \n\nI think the locals could see the rain coming, they smelled it in the air. But not me. When the second set kicked off the rain came down like a gift from god, a blessing from Jerry. It blew our minds and we all erupted with rapturous joy. The rain persisted, and the band kept playing on, eventually clearing up and sliding into an extended Terrapin. A jam beyond description.\n\nOverall, it was not the best performance on record, but the energy was definitive, as always, and eerily in tune with the elements. I wouldn't see another weather phenomenon like that until 20 years later, when the dead played their farewell shows in San Jose and Jerry made his guest appearance out of the sky, in the form of a brilliant double rainbow. Magic moments. \n\nI've been afraid to go back and play the shows from this final tour, knowing the boys were not at the top of their game. But, in spite of everything, it was still the best game in town. Afterwards, we broke down in Ohio, and missed the riots in Deer Creek, but caught up with them on my birthday in St. Louis and made it all the way to Soldier Field for Jerry's last shows. And I would do anything to see it all again.",
