Nothing quite like 80,000+ freaks streaming from the seats down onto the floor of the stadium.  Couldn't even see the wall.  Shakedown started this and the chaos didn't let up all night.  All the folding chairs had been thrown into huge piles and folks were blazing and throwing DOWN...Boogie Down Productions, DEAD HEAD STYLE!!!  I had never witnessed the boys at a stadium before, especially a place so enormous!!  A bit intimidating at times.  Pure adrenaline and excitement all night...thanks to Beef, ya know!!  Very exciting show.  The second night wasn't too bad, but seems they were going through the motions.  Great summer with Buckeye and Deer Creek and Charlotte and lots of driving.  Samson, Other One and Morning Dew were fun for me too.  Get this.  Great chunky PHIL.. Deep and Phat..",

      "review_text": "one of the best sounding SBDs of the year This is really an outstanding SBD for the era.  Vince is not to loud, Phil has nice presence and bobby cuts with a little more distortion than usual.  I saw all 17 shows this summer and remember this as middle of the road.  Upon listening to this today while out enjoying the sunshine, I really think it's a) one of Vince's best performances and b)one of the better shows with a lot of the newer tunes that sometimes didnt shine (e.g. picasso moon, corrinna etc..).  Drums is very interesting with a cool sampled highlife style bass riff early on (probably beam derived) .  The post space segment is excellent with Phil delivering one of the more powerful opening lines ever to the other one (check out 10/27/79 for the best intro phil lick!).    Morning dew is well read although a verse is skipped and steve Miller adds neat bits of guitar in a different sound range than bob or Jerry.  \n   I did notice a blip at the begining of don't ease, but other than that this is a great modern show.",

      "review_text": "2nd show I would like to submit this show for consideration for anyone who thinks the boys didn't play a solid kick ass show after 91.  Jerry, and the whole band are solid and on fire all night.  This also happens to be my 2nd show, my first being 10-26-89!  By this show I had already understood the dead; my first show was pretty much just plain crazy, and unfortunately I did not appreciate it until years later. \nThe Shakedown opener is definitely one of the best all around shakedown's of the Vince era.  Until now I only had a shitty aud copy of this show. The sound is mixed just about perfect, with Phil really comming through in a delicious way.  Everything else in the first set is played very well.  The second set really shines.  Ship of Fools is an excellent 90's rendition.  Corrina is good, followed by an inspired drums.  Space goes into Smokestack Lightening, but Bobby sings the words to Spoonful instead, which fit well and was an interesting twist.  At this point, Steve Miller joins in with some juicy, tasteful licks.  The Other One is one of my favorite 90's versions of all time.  It's musically tight, with a fiery intensity.  The original bus footage was on the video screens for this rendition.  The Morning Dew is another spectacular standout to end the second set.  Jerry rips and shreds tasty guitar all over the place.  The band seems especially fired up and in tune with each other all night, especially during TOO and    AM Dew.  I loved the Baba O'Reilly at the show, and its pretty good listening back to it all these years later.  The Tomorrow Never Knows is even better.  I got the sense at the end of this show that the boys were very much rejuvenated and ready to kick down the killer shit for years to come.  This show happened the day I graduated from high school in Poughkeepsie, NY.  I brought 2 of my high school friends who were straight up hip hoppers from the city whom had never listened to the dead.  They, who always jokingly referred to me as hippie, had an amazing experience at this show, loved it.",

      "review_text": "Some great moments I walked out of this show riding high and feeling the buzz of a memorable evening of solid Dead enhanced with Oregonian caps and stems. This night started horribly with the weakest Shakedown I'd ever witnessed. This was in part due to volume and mix issues, but come on, don't play this one unless y'all are ready to get it on. Imagine that, Shakedown a weak point of a show! Sound quality in the stadium improved throughout the first set but the performance did not. Where's Jerry?  Perhaps I was just unable to enjoy adequate music because of a frustrating opening but I was beginning to feel like I was witnessing The greatest band in the universe falling apart at the seams. Things began to click (FINALLY!) during Corrina (oddly enough) as Mr. Lesh filled the stadium with SUPER FAT and danceable grooves. During Drums footage of the ongoing lunar eclipse was up on the screens as the night was beginning to dig deep. Micky appeared in front of the drum kit with a train horn strapped to his waist and gave it a gargantuan blast that completely pummelled the crowd into submission. The video crew gave us images of trains as Micky smiled wickedly while letting loose on his toy. At this point we experienced a complete turn around in the band. Everything from here on gelled. During the latter parts of space Steve Miller joined in and they worked their way into a pleasing Spoonful. Other One rocked hard with a total of 24 vibrating guitar strings. Morning DEw worked perfectly as a soulfull landing strip after the 30 minutes of madness. The Baba O'Rielly>Tomorrow Never Knows encore was simply stunning. We were at the verge of tears when they sang \"Dont cry, don't brace your eye, it's only Teenage Wasteland\"--couldn't think of a better song to end a show at a New Jersey football stadium. Baba started to fade out and we thought that was it but the band locked into a fascinating Bill-led groove and the Spaceship Grateful Dead sailed into the deeply psychedelic waters of Tomorrow Never Knows. STUNNING. Phil (who reffered to hearing TNK in a Berkely record shop 25 years earlier as a seminal point in his own musical direction) slipped in a few phrases from the Talking Heads \"Once in a Lifetime\" at the tail end of the song leaving the joyous crowd with wink.\n first 2/3 of the night gets 1 star (for showing up) last 1/3 earns 5.",

All of the reviews here are excellent, and although this was a mellow show to start (which is fine when you're getting your bearings) it did cook after \"Space\". I was in the upper level, away from the chaos below, and the thing to remember is that this was Jersey, so at night the sky became this pinkish purplish color thanks to the methane gas that hovers over that state (I don't think it was just my trip).  They played with our heads a bit when the screen showed two dancing eyeballs on either side of Bobby during \"Other One\", which also featured great footage of Further which inspired a cheer from the crowd.  I'm thrilled to see a soundboard back on this site",

      "review_text": "Slow down I was at this show and already a bit freaked in the NYC scene (and I'm from NY state!).  I was waaay in the nosebleeds when they hit that first chord of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Shakedown.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 Seemingly hundreds of people poured over the wall like trout swimming in the wrong direction.  Overwhelmed, security guards just randomly selected someone on whom to impose their vast supremacy, and then relentlessly pursued that person like wolves in February.  I saw hippies being hurled about by their ponytails. Man, it was a horrifying scene.  I was already aware of the lore surrounding those NYC security guards, and they did not disappoint.  What a scene. They could have used guys like that at Deer Creek in \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c295\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 then maybe there would have been a 2nd night\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 I digress\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 I was so busy paying attention to that mayhem that I missed the first couple of tunes!  Love to hear them (again!).  I think this is a pretty solid show, first set especially.  I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2ve never cared much for the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Baba/Tomorrow\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 encore.\n     But on a more OCD level, I cant be the only person who hears the speed and pitch problems with this otherwise good recording.  I downloaded a free program called \"WavePad\" that you can use to do all sorts of things to your audio files. I used it to simply slow the speed/pitch of this show (song by song) to about 95%.  Try it with \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Jack A Roe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 and listen to the difference.  I love Jerry and the Boys as much as the next guy, but he did not play that fast or sing that high since the 70's.  I am always amazed at how many similarly fast recordings I've heard over the years (through over-dubbing or whatever) and so few people realize.  Thank God (Buddha, Ahhah, Ozzy, whoever) for digital files.  If they're broke, you can fix 'em!",

I guess many Heads have this experience but I was not prepared for how quickly I felt my time had passed me by.\nI am sure Vince was a great person, if i would have met him I would have thanked him for the breakout Here Comes Sunshine in Arizona ,one of my favorite memories from touring. But I just really did not like where his keyboards took the Dead sound.\nI personally thought the Steve Miller Band was hotter than the Dead this day and that does not say much because those guys are not road warriors.\nI really tried to hang with this show but I was extremely distressed by the Dead covering Baba O'reily even with the nice Beatles encore.\nI went to a couple of more shows after this one and the highlights pretty much ended up being the Jerry ballads.\nI am sure there are some of you out there who were just getting on the bus as I was jumping off and that is what made the Dead scene so incredible.\n\nI wish they had picked \"Magic Bus\" instead of \"Teenage Wasteland\" but hey I enjoyed the music that was played and when I no longer did it was time to go.",

The first set highlight for me was Desolation Row since it's my favorite Dylan song and the first time I saw the Dead play it live. The overall scene had gotten so bad around this time with the newer wave of heads and security having to deal with them. People actually told me to sit down because they couldn't see!!!!",

      "review_text": "Nineteen years and a day ago, I started to wonder... . . .if the end was in store.  Not so much for the band, but for me making the effort to drive more than 25 miles from my home in Haddam, CT to make it to a show.  Seemed like I was hearing Picasso Moon and/or Easy Answers and/or Long Way to go Home and/or Corrina at every show.  And with all due respect to anyone that enjoys those tunes, they just don't hold a candle to Jerry's new tunes or the prior \"catalog\".  Also, I didn't like Vince's sound - - keys or vocals.  And didn't like the tunes he sang other than Samba in the Rain which was tolerable because it was danceable.  Factor in Jerry's playing becoming inconsistent [uninspired] as well as how up front Vince was in the mix, and things just were not clicking.  And as I listen to this one almost 19 years to the day later, I feel just like I did that night in NJ... bored and wondering what had become of that magical band I first saw in July '74.  There were a couple nice moments this night, but truth be told they were very few and very far between.  And they were all Jerry's moments [Candy Man & Morning Dew come to mind]. Only reason I'm not giving this a lower rating is because of Morning Dew- -a song that always bumps a show's rating by a star.  \n\nBy the way, I kept going to shows almost to the bitter end with RFK '95 being my last two shows.  And while much of summer '95 was painful musically, it was more painful to watch Jerry deteriorate physically.  But for how bad it got, I'd give anything for him to be able to dust off those rusty strings just one more time.....",
