How about a great Let it Grow where Jerry is inspired! But the 2nd Set, another Dream Set,just blows you away. Scarlet>Fire, Playin, Wheel>Truckin>Other One>Wharf Rat.Only a Dark Star could improve this set! One of the reasons here that 1977 was a special year. Get this show fans, it will become one of your favorites as it has for me. Crank it up!\nDr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "Casey Jones (special) I'd read about this in Deadbase, and decided to check it out.  A VERY crisp SBD, with the band sounding like they are a foot away (though Lesh's lines are hard to pick out).  So how in the world did this Casey Jones run on for 13:45? (BTW about two minutes of that is tuning before and after the song). At the four minute mark, Garcia forgets the words to the third verse (understandable, perhaps, as it was his first attempt to sing it since 1974).  After a solo over the verse, he takes another, and another, and another.  By about the sixth time through, Keith gets to solo, and he provides some old-timey western saloon licks.  After nearly three minutes, Garcia is able to tell us that \"The trouble with you is the trouble with me....\" \n  \nJack Straw follows, with the drummers setting a fast pace after the first set of verses.  It fairly rocks, but very short (four 1/2 minutes of music).  Brown Eyed, Garcia does his solo a little differently, straying just slightly from the melody.  Let It Grow is driven by some great drumming.  Not a screamer, but energetic.  Overall, great sound quality and decent performance.",

I didn't know many Dead tunes (or I didn't THINK so - turned out I knew a bunch), so I just kept saying I hope they play Casey Jones and Truckin. People kept telling me they hadn't played Casey Jones since '74 and had only played Truckin a couple of times since, so I shouldn't get my hopes up.\n\nWhen they opened with that sloppy but HOT Casey Jones, BAM - instant Deadhead. The show still holds up real well, but my second show was 1/22/78 in Eugene, which blew this one (and all subsequent shows) away. Still great memories. And the sbd is really clean.",

Late '77 was the first time the band played it since 1969. A flashback. This show also has a rockin' revival of Truckin', which they stopped playing in '74.

Second, the set list features not one but two break outs (first \"Casey\" since '74, first \"DuPree's\" since '69)as well as just the fourth post-hiatus \"Truckin'\". But it's the blistering execution that pushes the marvelous show to the next level. Every tune from the opener on is just smacked over the fence. While not a one would crop up one of these fun-but-rather-pointless \"best version ever\" discussions, the cumlative effect is devastating. The Scarlet>Fire is a masterpiece. I would rank this among the very top shows from this stupendous year.

Solid jam exchanges ensue. The following Jack Straw is strong, with Bobby being unusually thrashy and adding some nice licks in the mix. Other first set rarities include the First Dupree's Diamond Blues since 69'! Solid Version (Jer forgets some lyrics, can you blame him?) and the crowd loves it. For some reason, in this version, Donna's off-key back vocals create a cool whimsical mood that candy coats the Dupree's revival. \nThe Let it Grow could seriously be the best i ever heard. You just never hear them thrashing it this hard after the 74-75 hiatus, or ever. Mickey Hart is as active as ever in this version and every member knows that this is a hot night before its over.\n\nThe second set has a slightly more ordinary setlist, but everything seems to work out well.

Unfortunately, things do seem to peter out a bit after the rollicking version of Truckin, with a kind of ragged, sluggish sounding Other One, and Garcia's lead  in Wharf Rat getting cut off by some annoying tape warble.
