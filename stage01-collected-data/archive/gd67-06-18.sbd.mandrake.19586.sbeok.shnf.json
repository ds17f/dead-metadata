      "review_text": "Bill Graham & Alligator->Caution mysteries I've been researching the Monterey Pop Festival for almost 10 years now, trying to compile setlists and recordings of all the performers.  If you look on setlist.com, you'll see a page dedicated to Monterey and all the setlists I've gathered thus far.  The mystery of the Grateful Dead setlist for this show has been discussed for years, mainly with regards to Alligator->Caution and whether Bill Graham handled their outro.\n\nI've confirmed that Bill Graham was most definitely handling outro's that evening.  The band that played immediately before the Dead was The Who.  At the conclusion of My Generation, their last tune, you can hear Bill say, \"let's hear it just one more time for The Who\".  He was also behind the stage that evening speaking with various performers as documented in \"Monterey Pop\" by Joel Selvin. \n \nI can also confirm that Alligator->Caution was part of their set that evening.  Apart from the outro by Bill Graham, the greatest evidence lies in the sound of the recordings of the Festival.  It's tough to describe in words, however, if you listen to the recordings of all the performers, there's no doubt.  The recordings of the applause after each performer have a very unique cadence (for lack of a better term) that is evident throughout each performance over the three days.  This holds true at the end of \"Caution\" during which Bill Graham's outro states \"let's do it just one more time, let's hear it again...the Grateful Dead\".\n \nIn regards to Alligator being a very primordial version without vocals, the issue was actually an equipment malfunction.  This was an ongoing problem with many of the performances throughout the Festival.  Jerry and Bobby's backup vocals are evident, but Pigpen's microphone is initially not functioning.  A few minutes into Caution, the issue is resolved and Pigpen can be heard.\n \nI can point out other unique similarities to confirm my theory, but the ones I've outlined above are the strongest.  Hope this puts to rest once and for all the mystery surrounding their performance.  If you have any questions, or comments, I appreciate all feedback.",

I'm sure this performance must have been very ear opening for those in attendance, and the highlight if you were partaking of the ultra great acid avaialable then and there, truly historic. Jamming simply unheard of then, completely off on it's own thing and so well developed already. Really, it's essential to any comprehensive history of American music.",

Whether they got up and danced or stared in acid-induced fascination. I'd do a little of both if I were there. They were SO on that night man! And the vocals are actually really awesome! Sometimes it sounded kinda bad, but they were REALLY on that night!\nAlligator instrumental is a neat little ditty. Caution is rockin. Cold Rain and Snow sounds just fine.

      "review_text": "Good, inconsistent performance. I have to agree, this is a great Viola Lee. It's short but definitely packed with energy (listen to the meltdown), but the Cold Rain is poor. It starts off well, but the instrumental break (where Jerry and Pig usually play in unison) is an absolute disaster. Was Pig so drunk that he forgot to play his B-3 and decided to play harmonica with his asshole? Whatever it was, it ruins the entire song. \n\nMaybe it wasn't Pig, since on Alligtor, you can hear him singing off-mic (he's almost inaudible) while this same idiot continues his flatulent adventures on the harp, also ruining Alligator. Thankfully somebody removed him from the stage (and hopefully kicked his ass afterward) before he could ruin Caution, cause Pig blows some real good harp on this track.",

      "review_text": "wow Even though I've listened to many hours of 68/69 music, I'm not as versed in pre-69 Dead as many others who browse these far corners of the archives so I tried to withhold a rating but the archive wouldn't let me.\n\nHaving said that I've grown up and continue to be a lover of country Dead among their many styles, and have lived primarily in the early 70's as a result.  After discovering the Archive and downloading many of those shows I got a little tired of seeing Sugar Magnolia on the setlist, and rather than gravitating towards 77 and beyond I've ventured to 69 and earlier.  I can see how people (especially those who experiened this stuff firsthand) believe these were the best of times as the raw power is unmatched.  \n\nSo I've found myself creeping further back in time to 67 recently, and came across some funny reviews about how lame the harp playing in Alligator is here, so I tuned in for a laugh as much as anything.  I gotta tell you, to less trained ears all I could focus on is how manic the playing is.  To hell with the harp, this version to me is 10x better than the early 70 Gators I've listened to, and the way the entire band yells Alligator into the mike at the end of the song is off the charts.  The energy is just top notch, as it is in Viola Lee Blues (as usual) and Caution.\n\nSo I put my 5 star rating here in print, perhaps to revise it down to a 4 after I've listened to Alligator another 20 times and that harp does start to finally annoy me.  \n\nThere must be some way to get all the people lost in doling out 5 star ratings to the 80's and 90's shows to come to the 60's now that soundboards are readily available.",

      "review_text": "Good Bad Show Many things about this show that are good and not so good.  Whats good about it is that the quality of the recording is incredible and not what you would expect to hear from a tape from 67.  I don't disagree with Cream-Puff-War man, Viola Lee Blues is powerful and funky, but Jerry's guitar is out of tune and the performance is sloppy.  Cold Rain and Snow is the same.  Alligator is good except, the soundman forgets to turn Pigpen up (if you listen closely, you can hear the lyrics just barely.  Caution is good.  Pigpen delivers an amazing performance and a powerful one.  I give a four, because its acually a really fun recording to listen to.",

      "review_text": "bad asset by angry young band This is an upgrade of the Grateful Dead at Monterey Pop (3 day festival), a generation up from the other circulating version.\n\nIncludes on-stage announcement \"The Beatles Aren't Here\" by Peter Tork (Tork also introduced the Buffalo Springfield set)\n\nIt has been ascertained that the Alligator and Caution are from this date... see reviews for more info. \n\nThere were technical glitches and unharmonic accompaniment at times, but the overall sound quality of this still unreleased historic set epitomizes what a \"live\" 1967 show \nsounds like in sparkling 8-track stereo.\nIn brief, it ROCKED!\n Garcia's guitar playing is out-of-control in this breakneck-paced set, and the overall sound ambience is unlike any other recording of the band. \nFor what it's worth, this is perhaps the most incredible Viola Lee Blues of the year 1967. \nThere are contenders, such as March 18 and September 3rd (the legendary Rio Nido VLB jam ends abruptly on LMA, but a more complete version has been added as a bonus on their remastered debut album which is also included with the Golden Roads box set); also, the August 4th '67 version of Viola Lee has a cool vibrato gtr effect compliments of Garcia. \nThe song was also recorded on Vanguard circa 1967 by Jim Kweskin's Jug Band.\nBut the Grateful Dead owned it so to speak, often using it as their all-out improvisational show stopper during their '66 through '69 shows (check the 1969-04-21 encore VLB (read Dr. Flashback's review).\nVLB invokes the summer of love era GD - an anthem for their '67 tangle with the establishment . \n\nThe outtake footage of the Dead playing VLB at Monterey Pop shows them at their peak, giving it all they've got, paying attention... on the reprise after the jam, Jerry holds up his right hand and jumps up, twice for good measure. \nPigpen appears to have been playing it seriously, not at all smash blocked... with a pair of long feathers tucked into his headband. \nFor another impressive filmed performance of the prime evil Dead (get a load of Pig man!) doing Viola Lee, take a look at them in Petulia (1968 movie).\n\nCold Rain and Snow is a blast too, in spite of technical difficulties that only last for a few seconds (don't sweat the small stuff!). \nNo problem with Caution (Do Not Step On the Tracks). \nListen for Bill Graham's outro on the other version.\nThe other version on LMA also has commentary by Bob Weir (and a rant by that kookie cream puff man).",

The band fairly flies apart at the seams!! The Dead always said they blew it at Monterey and I'd reluctantly agree to that assessment after listening to the awful out of key harmonica playing during Alligator. Someone should have kicked that joker in the 'nads and tossed him off the stage. And perhaps someone did as the middle and ending sections of Alligator are thankfully harmonica free. It's not Pigpen either unless he can sing and \"harmonicize\" at the same time. His very well played harmonica is in evidence on Caution. Horrible harmonica aside tho this is some of the highest energy Grateful Dead extant. Jerry and Bill play like wildmen. Pigpen's singing and organ playing on Caution are impassioned and amazing, trading off organ licks with Jerry and singing as tho his life depended on it. You know what, I'm not going to agree with the band that they blew it at Monterey because the good moments far out weigh any bad ones. Worth a listen and it's pretty well recorded to boot.",

      "review_text": "Energy, Energy, Energy at the '67 Monterey Pop Festival I agree, the really bad harmonica is NOT Pigpen. There are portions where you can hear both the bad harmonica and Pigpen on organ or on vocal faintly in the background. There is some brief good harmonica in Caution, which is Pigpen. \n\nI like to drink a lot of coffee and listen to this show, a great performance despite the sound system problems. A high-energy, primordial Alligator made better when Pigpen's mic kicks in,  flowing into Caution. This was still new material at this time, the Dead having recently abandoned a lot of the blues standards they were playing in 1966 for these free-form originals. Viola Lee is also good, but go and listen to some of the 1966 versions for some perspective. I like this Cold Rain and Snow, fast and driving, typical for '66/'67. Yes, a little sloppy, but the whole set is not as tight as some other 1967 shows. In this case, the Dead make up for in artistic interpretation.\n\nThere's another version of this hear at Archive. It's basically the same, but it includes two interview clips and lacks \"the Beatles aren't here.\"\n\nBut who was there at the historic 1967 Monterey Pops Festival! A great performance from Hendrix, who sets his guitar on fire at the end of Wild Thing. And a great performance from the Who, who smash their guitars at the end of My Generation. It's great to have this recording of the Dead's set.",

The other copy on the Archive is badly cut.\n\nIn many accounts of the Monterey Festival, the Dead just disappear, sandwiched as they were in a thankless slot in-between the Who & Jimi Hendrix.... \nHowever, this set is awesome - it's kind of like 5/5/67, so much energy they practically fly off the stage. \n\nThere has been a dispute over whether the Alligator>Caution actually comes from this show, since apparently the source is different & Bill Graham speaks after Caution. \nBut it is from this show. Not only is the general sound & vibe the same, but it has the same rotten harmonica player who was in Cold Rain & Snow! (He's not Pigpen, by the way - Pigpen's mike was dead for the start of Alligator - but he might have been familiar with the songs since he seems to be trying to play in the right spots.) \n\nI think this is the earliest Alligator we have. (\"5/5/67\" is a misdated show, and \"1/27/67\" is even more off-date; they're both from later in the year.)\nWhat puzzles me is that the Alligator blazes into Caution.... The next few Alligators all just stop with the vocal reprise, we don't have another Alligator>Caution until 9/15/67. Just a minor Dead mystery....",

In my opinion, you can forget Hendrix and The Who... The real show was right here, between the 2. Bill Graham (certainly not the announcer for the festival) can be heard after Caution...
