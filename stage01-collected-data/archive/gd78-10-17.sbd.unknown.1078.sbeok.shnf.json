SHe walks over to Garcia and says, \"I want to take banjo lessons.\" Garcia nicely replies, \"I don't do that anymore.\" She asks the same question again and Garcia gives her the same answer.

      "review_text": "I Can't Take This Sorry but I can't take this. I have provided 7 reviews so far with 6 of them being 5 stars and one being 4 stars. The reason for that is I have only been reviewing the very good/great concerts. I have not been keeping track of the duds. I just move on when there is a dud. Everyone has duds in their life. After reading these rave reviews I gave this one a try. Lets see; (1) \"Scarlet-Fire \nis beyond top notch. The band is very tight\"; (2) \"The Scarlet Begonias still give me goose bumps.\"\n\nLet me, Elvis The King, give the real story. Scarlet lasts 11:15. At 1:00 Weir is making annoying sounds. It finally starts at 1:41. Garcia screws up the lyrics from 2:34 through 3:03. Throughout the song Weir is playing soccer in a baseball game and Lesh is back in his mail truck on the field trying to deliver but he just can\u00c3\u00c2t find anyone.  There is some good guitar work by Garcia but it is played very slow. In Fire, Lesh is stuck on Po Po Da Po Po/Ba Po Po Ba Po Po. Weir is throwing in annoying whatevers but is mostly sleeping. The track lasts 14:56. It ends at 10:50. Therefore there is four minutes left over listening to them noodling. Awesome Scarlet/Fire. \n\nOne reviewer tells a nice story about a \"gal\" that goes onstage asking about banjo lessons. How someone heard what a gal asked Garcia on stage in a big building is beyond me. If you want to hear about a real \"gal\" go to my review of 05-26-73 titled \"Naked Girl Holding On.\" Now she and her friend were good time \"gals.\" \n\nI have so far downloaded only three songs. Let me give you a good tip. And it's free advice. I Need A Miracle truly is great. I may or may not be back to finish this review but with Scarlet/Fire sucking right now the most I can give is a 3 Star. I hope I didn't offend any Heads here but there is fantasy and reality. The fantasy is that the Dead were always great. The reality is a bad \nDead concert was still better than a good day fishing and a great Dead concert was pure euphoria. For a great concert in this timeframe go to 11/2/79. Elvis The King.",

      "review_text": "interesting stuff worth hearing, No dought not a gem, but historically relevant,backward-Egypt the first show of a run at the Winterland, runs that used to be so so good.  The band is clearly changing there ways, the mamatried>mexicali medli is just one example where bobby sandwiches 2 of his lesser tunes, as if to say they don't really add up to one song on their own!?  Then the second set scarlet>fire>estimated>eyes sequence, each one of these tunes used to shine on their own at one point past, now crammed in the cold cellar , reminds me of a motown revisited tv special with 70 yearold men dancing on stage in matching yellow suites. Don't mean to be mean, it's just obvious that some things were rotten and were only going to get worse.\n\n  On the positive side, hearing World to Give, which is IMO the best version performed, is great, all worlds change, now the material is fresh and relevant, and part of my Grateful Dead soundtrack, even if they only played this one a handful of times, only wish it was played more and earlyer.  \n     5 stars for IIHTW2G, 3 for the show",

I remember the slideshow from the Dead's Egypt trip as just one of the wonderful sights and sounds that filled my senses that evening.\nThis performance has its flaws, but in places Jerry's playing is just amazing.  \nIn contrast to some of the other reviewers, I like the first set.  And the Scarlet-Fire takes me right back to the floor of Winterland almost 30 years ago.  \nA sentimental \"must\" for me, and an enjoyable listen for you.",

He obviously didn't even listen to the entire recording, to not have heard the \"banjo lesson\" exchange... Elvis: it's a soundboard recording, which usually capture EVERYthing onstage, right down to the jokes they crack amongst themselves. That's why you can hear the entire exchange, if you bothered to listen.\n\nOk, enough with my rant. This is a sweet recording, as are most of the boards from the era. \"World to Give\" chokes me up every time I hear it. This is one of the tunes that made JG one of the most brilliant songwriters of our time, period. Listen to it and weep; if you ask me, if you don't get emotional when you hear JG pour his soul into such tunes, you don't \"get\" it and probably never did and never will...\n\nSorry folks, but I just can't help feeling a wee bit defensive when insensitive clods review recordings they never bothered to listen to.

      "review_text": "Sweet Wow, Elvis has his/her own trip happening - I've been around people who have a gift for talking folks like that down.  I can do it in a pinch; I'll let this one slide.  \n\nI was looking for a show that was close in time to when I asked my first girlfriend to \"go with me\"...(ahhh, how sweet!)  It was at a little-known festival on the north slope of the San Gabriel Mtn's north of LA at the end of September, 1978.  I was a senior in high school, and seriously retarded in the social graces, but she was receptive and sweet.  We kissed at the edge of an old pond amid all the lights and music at this festival at a Catholic monastery above the desert.  Quite the night.  Quite the lady - she 15, me just turning 17.  I'd been to a couple of Dead shows by this time, but hadn't been \"assumed\" quite yet.  \n\nAnyway, just now I particularly wanted to find out how the Dead sounded \"right then\", and looked up this show,  which happened two or three weeks after my early romantic foray.  I remember to this day how excited I was to be with her at that time, what a trip it was to be alive and in love for the first time, and thought I'd post - no other reason, just good memories.  That's what it's all about anyway, right? - why we come here looking for the tunes?  Of course the boyz were just as rockin as I remember them a few months later, after our break up, (tears and sadness), when I saw them in Anchorage in 1980 and became fully embroiled in \"life with the Dead\".\n\nAnyway, just thought I throw in my 0.02 cents worth for a decent show and a good jolt of nostalgia for times long past.  I still miss the girl, by the way, and think about her almost every day.  I haven't seen her since around 1981 or so...man, I really wonder how she is.\n\nAnyway, listen to the show, remember good times, and well you know, all good things - and I share this definitely with a touch of gray.",

Great separation of sound among the instruments, especially the guitars which sound fantastic.  Nice harmony vocal from Donna on FOTD, I know, I almost choked on my popcorn when I heard it.  She actually found the right notes.  I have to say though, as far as performance this one is basically a clunker.  The band is just not real tight, or that into it in my opinion.  Its kind of a shame since Jerry's voice is in good shape, and the sound quality is terrific.  The problem is actually Jerry.  His solos are too sloppy and frantic through most of the tunes.  Listen to TJ in the first set (does not really take off or smoke like a good TJ) Song selection is cool and some tunes come off good, Stagger Lee is a personal fav of mine, great lyric and a nice melody from Jerry.  Same thing with \"If I had the World to Give\".  The Scarlet sounds good but Jerry really screws the lyrics, which in a good Scartlet is no big deal, but this one's a little tame, the Fire sounds like a chore for the band.  It's pretty tedious to listen to.  Until the outro jam which is always really trippy and groovy (hard to screw up two chords).  Estimated follows and is nice and solid (probably the show highlight in my opinion).  The \"Eyes\" is disappointing here, Jerry's once sweet, groovy, and melodic fretwork just does not come together, the tempo is too fast and so is his riffing, too much technique and not enough melody.  Drums/Space is worth a listen anytime in my opinion.  Great sound/not an epic show/Average.",
