Jerry was so on this run.  I remember the storm that blew thru the Soldier's run was looming the day before these shows.  By the time the 21st rolled in , the weather couldn't have been more perfect. The mood, the crowd...I don't think it got any better for my experiences.  Not to say that I didnt see other amazing shows...but on the experience level this one sticks out. Plus I had an ongoing bet that we were gonna get a solstice Darkstar...okay...so I was two days off.  Great sound on this show (kept Vince nicely in the background vs. his usual high mix and overpowering vocals).",

But he is a incredible background player. The Piano sound is his strong suit. Really tasteful and classy player. Hints of Kieth but better. Jerry is just shreds the slipnot and Franklins is a some of the best pickin' of the 90's. Every thing that follows is top notch. Classic summer 93' first set.* I can not think of a better High Time In my 8 years of seeing the Dead. Way better than the Knick 93' or Nassua 90'. Lovely inrto Jerrys notes are thick and can really be felt. Both vince's playing and vocals really contribute to making this a special High Time indeed.",

Phil is enunciating each and every word to the point of madness. And just as impressive is the absolutely perfect notes Jerry is laying down right in response to Phil's lines. \"...swore that they would stand beside me when the game got rough...\" is followed by a heart wrenching pickin' performance as are the last few and many of the previous lines. I caught 13 shows in the summer of '93 and nothing stands out more in my mind that this number. Enjoy",

      "review_text": "Best Tom Thumb Blues. I was at this three show run. It was my last run of summer 93, my first summer tour, as such it had that bittersweet end of tour feel. When you knew the end was near, and then it was back to normal life[until fall anyway]. Kind of like the last day of summer camp, when you're a kid; you know you won't see these kids again until next summer,some of them never again. It was also my first visit to Deer Creek, as close to paradise as we latter day deadheads ever got. I missed the solstice show the day before, and to add insult to injury, I had my herb confiscated by overzealous law enforcement; at least they didnt make me spend the night in jail. We stayed at Pine Lakes Campground, after being woken up by dogs peeing on my tent, we all went for a swim, then headed to the lot. You couldnt ask for a more beatiful day, the circumstances seemed auspicious, so I dosed myself and went into the show. I had never been in the Creek before but I found my way to the sweet spot back by the fence as if by instinct. This place was the best balance of good sound and room to dance. By the time the boys took the stage the crowd was primed and ready. They charged out of the gate w/ a killer Help on the Way, they started finding the groove w/ a way spaced Slipknot. By the time they rolled into Franklins the whole place was caught up in a monster groove. Deer Creek had ceased to exist as a concert venue and had transformed into one huge organism, moving and breathing as one. We were communally reaching some of the highest peaks of consciousness ever reached by humans! The intro before the verses has to be almost 5 minutes, boy were they stoked!! Vince even sneaks in one of his, 'falling down the stairs and landing on his feet,' solos before the verse. Jerry is all over this one, his solos alternate between fingerpicked and shredding pickwork. The Wang Dang that follows is a Jerry showcase as well. Then a really, really sweet High Time, I can't think of a better song for a sunny summer day under the blue sky. Trust me, we were in heaven. This version is very well played, and sung, one of the best versions from the 80's-90's. Bobby keeps the good vibes flowin' w/ a good time All Over Now; Vince takes a nice barrelhouse style piano solo. In 93 it was still a treat when Phil would sing; to me it meant that he was confident in how well the band was playing. I cant add much to the other reviews except to say this is, by far, the best version of Tom Thumb ever. Jerry and Phil are both in top form on this one. If you don't want the rest of the show at least listen to this. Tennessee Jed does nothing to stop the party, great jam too. Come to think of it, the vibe was so good, not even the Picasso Moon brought the crowd down, and the boys exited to thunderous applause. Between sets these kind rainbow kids were nice enough to take me under there wing for the second set, being I was rather spun and needed some guidance and herb. The Victim here isn't nearly as good as the one from Louisville the week before, to me thats[6-15-93] the definitive version of Victim, for me Bobby dropped the ball for a minute here, not the right song for the moment. Crazy Fingers is a different story though, with a great closing jam. The L.L. Rain that follows is a thing of beauty; a showcase version for me. Bobby comes back after the jam for a second round of vocal theatrics. Speaking of vocal theatrics, the He's Gone that comes next is also a showcase version. I remebered the vocals at the end being more out there than they are on this tape, though they do get pretty far out there. Nice drumz; average Miracle. Days Between is a fair version and would be much better if Jerry didn't butcher the last verse. Powerful final jam though. Smokin' Johnny B. Goode was a major dancefest. Liberty encore is the same as the 20 other Liberty encores I saw. I left this show thinking it was the best I had ever seen, and definately as far as the vibe and the musical highlights it was one of the highest times of my life; just not the best Dead show I saw. Still worth a download for fans of 90s dead. An AUD would be nice here; the Creek has killer sound, and that way you can here the crowd reaction[which during the intro to Franklins is deafening].",

However, I was at this show and the Louisville one that summer and neither come close to the Victim > Foolish from Deer Creek 07/19/90 (perhaps Louisville was best from Vince years???). For me 07/18/90 & 07/19/90 were definitive.\n\nOtherwise this was excellent show. Help>Slip>Frank Rules. Can't say enough about Tom Thumb's. I loved this show and always loved the venue. This was my last run there and I will always remember it as my favorite venue.\n\nSound quality here is also very good.",

Not all in Life is a Sunshine Daydream or Happy Love, and I think Grateful Dead's darker songs address this aspect of our collective existence. \n\nAs for this show, like most in the Summer '93 run the first set is rather weak but this second set, especially Victim clear all the way through Space, is a real winnner. It has, without question, the best LLRain and He's Gone of the 90's (the best victim, IMHO, is 3.23.1992 at The Palace...check it out). The Days Between seems a little choppy to me, and Johhny B. Goode is  gratuitous to the point of annoyance...but expecting an entire 2nd set that is great by this point in their career was asking way too much.\n\nThe First set rates a 3 while the second set rates a 5. 5 for this recording, so 4 overall.",

My folks still have a farm about 1.5 miles from Deer Creek (now Klipsch), and I was a fan from my first show in 1989 (I was 15 years old!). The quality of these boards is excellent, and I absolutely love the playing. \"Crazy Fingers\" is just beautiful, and Phil's bass fills in the jam at the end so well. The transition to LLRain is beautiful as well.  \n\nI give it a four out of five stars, as I just cannot seem to give anything post 1991 five stars, and even then, they are few and far between. For example 6/7/91 from the same venue is a five star show for me. Still, this is definitely worth a listen for some quality 1993 Dead (no, that's not an oxymoron). ",

Help/Slipknot/Franklin's was a real firestarter. High Time came out of nowhere. I'm sorry but Phil just should NOT sing. LLR was very good overall. Jerry's really on point, but Bobby's voice was very limited, even compared to Jerry's. Gospel-esque vocal jam at the end of \"He's Gone\" was amusing, into space, which you expect me to remember? Days Between was stormy and trance-like, I remember thinking the hook reminded me of Tomorrow Never Knows. Bobby's sway bar saves that tune for me. Throwaway tunes after that.",
