My first time north of the border and my friend's crappy Peugot (is that how it's spelled?) broke down at the actual border near Buffalo on our way from New Paltz(SUNY). All seven of us jammed into our other vehicle and followed the tow truck to some backwoods mechanic. But I finally got into this one due to the kindness of a Canadian couple who sold me a ticket for face value ten minutes before showtime. They told me to have a good show and tossed me a couple of shots of brandy to numb out the cold. I obliged with some high quality bits of paper for them and ran in. I liked this show better than the others in Hamilton this run. The Shakedown is HOT and I recall the SOTM as one of my all time favorites. Sound quaility is supurb as well. Other Info Copps was attached to a shopping mall and heads weretrying to navigate the maze of elevators and hallways in an attempt to find a free way in... The cops at Copps were some of the nicest I've ever encountered at a show. I saw artwork in the police cruisers parked in front of the venue and one even had some kind of glowing skull sculpture on the dashboard. On the second night I was standing somewhere near the colleseum before the show and was approached by a cop. I thought for sure he'd say \"MOVE ALONG!!!!\" or something worse. Nope... He blew my mind and said \"Hey hows it going... Did you see last night's show? I thought it was great.. How about you AY?\" It was a big difference from having angry NYPD thugs on horseback try to kill you for standing in the wrong place at the wrong time at MSG.",

It was nice to have the boys in our backyard for a change. These were the last Canadian shows ever played. Had Jerry held out a little longer, the boys were scheduled to play the Sky Dome in Toronto for Fall Tour 1995.

He explained that he had 4 tix for both shows, and would I like to go?\nGee, let's see, hell yeah!!!\nSo we go to Hamilton, meet up with two of our friends there, and proceed to the coliseum. The cops were on horseback, and had 6\" diameter yellow happy face buttons over their badges...\nNo, I wasn't seeing things, we didn't drop until Sat.! We all were amazed, and said so the the cops, and they explained how they LOVED it when the Dead came to town, such a peaceful, and happy crowd, etc...\nFri. was a great show, got to see a lot of my fav songs live (in person) before Garcia passed on.\nSaturday night was PHENOMENAL!!!!!\nWe ate a bunch of acid, and after the show, we drove to Utica, NY through a blizzard while coming down,(OMFG! the tires were bald!!! White knuckle driving) to meet a friend there. We picked up what we came for, partied some more, and then made it back to MA and I to RI. \nTalk about a great weekend! \n\nSound quality on these two nights is very clean, of course, and Jerry actually sounds good here, after his stroke.

Deer Creek 1st night ruled (best first set in the post Brent 90's IMO). However, this first set at Hamilton also rocks. There are 3 Jerry Tunes, not 2 (hot Althea, BEW and a killer Birdsong) also Jerry sings a verse in Maggie's (Band tune).\n\nAs the band came out for the 2nd set I said to myself Shakedown, Mansmart, Darkstar and then watched it unfold. I had never really looked beyond the next song before and felt more connected to the band than ever before. This was a truely special night for me and all us Canadians.\n\nPhil is not thin on this SBD either. He is stomping throughout and the bass drum does not overpower when you boost the bass like some soundboards. This one is worth listening to.",

Dont worry it is alright to be wrong and ignorant just keep it to yourself.Right mom. Right!",

Anyways when I was 13 years old and lived within walking distance to Copps Coliseum, my buddy and I went to see the invasion of deadheads camped out EVERYWHERE downtown...it was Awesome, I bought my first hit of acid and about 150 people stormed the doors and rushed in, my friend and I Included! I gotta say, I've NEVER felt or seen anything like it again! IT WAS PEACEFUL, and the music was AMAZING, the people even better, I had never even listened to the Greatful Dead before then, I've been a fan ever since!\nAnyway, my apologies for writing you a book here.\nWhoever posted this...THANKS YOU",
