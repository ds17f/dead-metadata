      "review_text": "There is a HEAVEN and it's address is www.archive.org I have waited to get a SBD recording of this show for just over nine years and my friends at the archive you just made my day, AGAIN!! This was probably the single best show of 95. From the Hell in a Bucket right into the hottest Candyman I have ever heard then the first Take Me to the River, which was a nice suprise indeed, then lazy River Road, Masterpiece, Childhoods End all the way up to a JAMMIN JAMMIN Deal to end the first set.\n\n Second set Foolish Heart (whooo hoooo) opener. Long Way to go Home then on to the charged Saint of Circumstance. The Eyes of the World into Drums was so so fantastically ROCKING! The Wheel out of Space was a treat for sure then a really jammy All along the Watchtower, and the Standing on the Moon which at this particular show was phenomenal. Jerry was singing from his soul on this tune for sure. Encore was a given. One More Saturday Night, but no ordinary Saturday night by any means.\n\n The energy in the Pyramid that night was simply beautiful, and unlike any I had ever witnessed before in my adult life. Both the band and the crowd were into it and the place was simply ON FIRE. This was my first Foolish Heart and I had waited many a show to catch it. What can I say other than WOW!!!  The quality of this recording is absolutley PERFECT, it's just simply RIGHT ON!! It puts the box set that I paid $100 for to shame.\n\n Oh how long have I waited for SBDS of these shows. My wait is over. That whole weekend in Memphis was a time I will never forget as long as I live. The scene there was that of the mellowest run of shows I have ever been to. It's hard to believe that Jerry would be gone a little over four months later. I felt like they were ging to play forever that night, and I would have stood there and listened forever if they would have, and I don't think that I would have been the only one. Thank You archive.org for all you have done and continue to do. It's the little things in life like this that put smiles on peoples faces like mine. I LOVE YOU!!!",

Funny thing was that the April Fool's joke was that the better show was the night after 4/2/95. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast, but Jerry was more together the 2nd night. Thank you SO much Archive for a SBD of both night. \n\nForever Grateful. \n-MG",

      "review_text": "solid show I got an audience recording of this last year, and it was nearly intolerable, so this version was quite welcome.  I would say that this is a cut above the average 95 example - but 3 of the first set songs, (Masterpiece, Childhood's, and Lazy River Road) are not half as strong as 7-9-95, in my opinion.  Like most set-closing Deal's of 89-95, this one takes a while to get going, and although it cooks to some degree, Jerry seems a 1/2 step (excuse the pun) behind the rest.\nFor all intents and purposes, (the very solid stand-alone 'Saint' notwithstanding), this show will see circulation in my cd player on the strength of a huge April fools day 'Foolish Heart'.  If someone knows of a better one, I'd love to hear it.  \nSmall gripe: Standing on the moon is played quite well here, with a late surge and emotive singing by jerry, but standing on the moon is NOT a set closer.  i think morning dew is the only ballad that could fall under that rubric...",

      "review_text": "mixed feelings: AWESOME Foolish! I had just gotten back home from the 3/26 and the 3/27 shows in Atlanta. I remember the scene blowing Atlanta away; the cops were laid back in Memphis as well. There was a lot of anticipation in the air. Maybe it being april fools had something to do with it. Anyway, the show itself was average. Probably the weakest of the Atlanta/Memphis/Birmingham run. Although the Candyman and Lazy River Rd. are both beautiful. Couple of my favorite versions. The Foolish Heart that opened the second set was AMAZING. The build up/jam before the \"bite your hand\" verse was the best of any version I have ever heard. Eyes was ok. Standing on the Moon was another standout; Jerry's voice has that crack to it that puts goosebumps on your skin. The sound of this show sounds muddy however; especially at the beginning of Foolish heart. I thought it might have something to do with the acoustics of the pyramid, but the recording from the next night sounds crystal clear. 3 and 1/2 stars for the performance. Still better than nearly any summer tour show (sans 5/26, 6/2, and 7/9). 2 and a half stars for the sound. By the way...I HATED Foolish Heart till I heard it at this show. This version has gotten more repeated listens by me than any other song in my whole 1500 hour GD live collection. I use to make fun of this song. It was down there with I Will Take You Home and Day Job. Funny how things change.",

      "review_text": "Great Show? Rockin? I LOVE the Dead too, but let us be realistic. This is a prelude to the atrocity that comes in the summer. No sharp turns and not really inspired. Everything is muffled on the ends. The 13 minute Foolish can be equated to a torturous stroll across lilly pads in crocodile alley. Was that a jam during Saint? Sounded like the push to a bathroom stall while peaking on microdots. And Eyes, come on....either this recording or the band is really skewed. Being there, this had to have been one of the worst Eyes that they ever played. Listen to the turns ...there's no jam and Jerry is muddling through it. \n\nThis recording is not too good as well. It sounds like it's being pumped through the water at an apple bobbing contest.\n\nLet's get real. The quality of the show is not predetermined by the experience in the parking lot. But then again, my first show was Merriweather '85, so I may be a little biased. While this recording may evoke some great memories of good times, the reviews are for \"these\" recordings, not whether you managed to evade arrest while driving 200 mph thru downtown while peaking on a 1/4 of shrooms.",

But it doesn't really come together in the jam until about 8 measures before they're back into the verses.  But when it does resolve itself, it seems to make perfect sense.  Garcia lays back a little, and lets the rest of the band vamp on the chords.  Then he brings it all back.  It's not the best version I've heard (that would be Buckeye Lake '93), but it's a really good one.  Also, Childhood's End is very nice on this show.  This is probably the absolute least listened to or talked about GD song in the history of their career.  But this and the acoustic version from 94 are keepers.",

I was shocked to see and hear Jerry obviously in much worse shape since then. There are some good tunes here. The Deal and Watchtower are probably the best ones of 1995. The Saint of Circumstance was a nice surprise. Eyes>Drums>Space>The Wheel>Watchtower>SOTM is the best part of the show. The next night however is the better of the two shows. And one of the best of 1995.  It's truly a 3, but because 1995 was so bad, I'll give it a 4.  ",
