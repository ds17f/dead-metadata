Perhaps the memory skews my perception, but watching the sun set as Jerry sings To Lay Me Down was one of those perfect GD moments.  I treasure it.  The rest of the set was nearly flawless, and the song selection perfect for a summer afternoon.  Set II was well played too.  They also had fireworks after Casey Jones.  Enjoy",

During each song, I could hear Jerry saying to everyone in so many words that this was going to be it; the last tour.  As it turned out his collapse was two months later and there would be no fall tour. To Lay me down, Know you Rider, Long Way home, Last Time, China Doll. It seemed redundant after awhile to me how he was putting the message out there.  The show was beautiful, but it sounded tired.  I left this show feeling sad.  When I hear it now, it is one of my favorites from the early 90s. Crisp, clean and true.  Fortunately, Jerry recovered this time and came back with a fire in early 93.  From that point I realized I had to catch as many shows as possible.  Get this one for the beauty of the Help>Slip>Franklins and the last To Lay Me Down.",

Second set heats up a little more and the Casey Jones is totally slammin'! I guess everyone else on the lawn went to the DC show (I didn't) as I was about the only one losing my shit on the lawn during Casey Jones. whatever. I give it a four for giving us in 1992 the most classic encore the Dead ever played.",

Of course, Cornell is legendary, and many people, including myself, think that Englishtown was even better. But this one is the best of them all. Garcia, his guitar with a bright calypso drum tenor, plays a looooong and high-energy solo. Just when you think the solo is going to end, WHEEEEE, he takes it up an octave or two into territory unknown. And then does it *again*. Between that and Bobby's INSANE vocals, this version has one of those classic mindblowingly intense crescendoes. This version is guaranteed to lift your spirits no matter what's on your mind.",

As another reviewer says, this Long Way to go Home is more that one of the best ever, it's a delicious piece of music with a rippin' lead break by Jerry and the perfect tempo and vibe for this song. i really dig the vocals at the close, really cool. \nOverall a pretty solid show for 1992 \nI joined some friends on the grass at the bottom of the hill outside the back of the arena, because tickets were essentially non-existent. Probably one of the toughest tickets to score of any show I attended, along with the Richfield shows in September of '90 that were the first since we lost Brent (RIP brother).\nSlipknot! gets out there, fantastic.\n\nA note on the scene: this was the first time I ever saw bungee jumping at a show. There was a crane and I believe $40 would get you a eide. Crazy stuff. Also saw a gyroscopic ride that was three (2) hoops of descending size with the rider in the center hoop. The hoops would spin along separate axises creating a weightless type feeling. Also bumped into KamiKosmic. If you don't know him, he is (was?) a street musician who roller bladed around with an electric guitar, red and white target type design on the body. He was dressed in a futuristic looking full body jumpsuit and a big white turban holding his massive dreads. He had a little amp on his belt. Look him up on YouTube, he's awesome. The funniest thing was as he played a song my buddy requested (he was a big fan) called \"heads of skin\", he comes a dude on a skateboard with a bass guitar hooked up to a similar amp. Duded then jammed out along with him! Too cool.\n\nGreat memories!",

But I was working in a record store and was able to get incredible seats for this show.  I was way upfront.  This is the show that forever changed my mind about the Grateful Dead.  The moment I'll never forget...well, I was having a great time, but at one point my energy was lagging.  I was standing there, very close to the stage, in the middle, with my arms crossed and evidently looking kind of glum.  All of a sudden I caught Bill Kreutzman's eye.  He noticed me, nodded and gave me a wink.  I broke out into a huge smile and he smiled back.  That was it.  The band had such a connection to the audience that night and the performances were stellar.  I'm glad I was there.",

The Speedway, the Casey Jones encore, rocking out in the corn fields. Overall, I believe Spring tours were higher energy. This show was great but the 2-night stands & long distances seemed to take it out of the band as much as the tour heads. Other good ones from this tour are Chicago w/James Cotton and Charlotte w/Satisfaction.",
