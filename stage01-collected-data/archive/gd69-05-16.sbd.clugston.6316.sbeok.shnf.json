I can't really understand why this show is such a disaster considering the amazing shows of just a few weeks earlier at The Ark. Not to forget, this recording is very hissy.

Nobody sounded committed to the tune, but by the end they're all more or less on the same page (thankfully they realized how bad they sounded and cut it short).\nThe sound quality isn't all that bad either.

The Dead seemed capable of playing this tune in two ways, either as great blues funk groove or an off rhythmic slaughteration. This one falls firmly into the slaughteration camp and is a disaster from start to finish. Compared to what these guys were capable on a good night in '69 this show is odiferous and is a top 10 pick of all-tome loser GD shows. Still beats a lot of ''95 though.",

Not only did we meet Garcia, but he invited us into his car (an old beater green Ford Cortina) and got us loaded on his pot. I sure wish I had a snapshot of that moment!!!

I was not only at this show, but as a member of the Class of '69 at Campolindo, I was part of the student committee that put this on.\nWe did two concerts my senior year as part of a senior class fundraiser.  The \"Santana Blues Band\" had played in the Fall.  Other senior classes did car washes and bake sales.  We did rock concerts.\n\nI had been going to see the Dead for over a year at this point and was amazingly disappointed by this show.  The dean of boys (Joseph Anthony) wouldn't let Jerry smoke in the gym and he slammed his guitar into his case and stormed off stage.  Most of the set is performed without him.  This was easily the shortest Dead set ever performed with the exception of a show they did in Oakland as a benefit for a Black Power group and Bobby got in a fight with one of them onstage.\nOne interesting bit of trivia about this show is that it was the first time Phil's father ever saw him play.\nDavid Mahler  Campolindo High   Class of '69",

Won't vouch to the reviews, seem to be all over the board, but about the concert, alan macomber and scott bauhofer (this is scott) came up with this idea for making money for the school, and put on both Santana in the fall and the Dead in the spring.  We paid Santana $1250 for the night, based on the sellout of this one, we went searching for the spring show, came up with the Dead, and that one cost us $2000 for the night.  And in addition to Jerry not being allowed to smoke, I think when the principal turned the gym lights on at 11 in the middle of a song, they probably were not all that happy with the experience.  But regardless, having the Dead at Campolindo was still pretty damn cool.",

      "review_text": "Meager in Moraga. Bob Weir recovers the fumble, restores the fun. Although it has some very good moments, this is a scruffy offering, especially by 1969 standards. Pigpen and Jerry are both guilty of committing some baffling lyrical blunders in the middle of songs which had been in their repertoire for months. Still, Jerry pencils in some nice lines on the Gibson SG, and the drummers rattle up a couple of interesting grooves. They never achieve that fire-breathing dragon effect so prevalent in 1969, but to be fair this setlist isn\u2019t really conducive to that kind of acrobatic energy in the first place.\n\nFar and away, without question, the MVP of this show is Bob Weir. While everyone else is busy fumbling the show, Bobby, the young kid of the group who\u2019d been faced with so much criticism from his bandmates in late \u201868, steps up as the true professional of the evening and salvages the performance. He stokes the fire back to life with some bright, creative guitarwork and rich vocals that stay lyrically onpoint. Ace can do no wrong. Hats off to Bobby for bailing out his bandmates.\n\nAs for the unique context of this show, I think any of us would\u2019ve loved for this to happen at our alma mater. Even so, the 1965-1966 rock \u2018em sock \u2018em Warlocks lineup would\u2019ve been much better suited to play a high school dance like this one than the 7-man psychedelic cowboy 1969 lineup. The boys must\u2019ve decided this wasn\u2019t the time or place to uncork a Dark Star, That\u2019s It for the Other One, or a wave of Feedback, so they settle for a huge scoop of squirrely Pigpen and then unplug the axes. 5/30/69 is far better overall, but this one is unique, and still has that irresistible, unmistakable Aoxomoxoa-era sound.\n\nIn short, although they never catch the X factor, Bob puts on a clinic. It\u2019s 50 minutes of \u201860\u2019s Cali Dead, so it\u2019s well worth a spin.",
