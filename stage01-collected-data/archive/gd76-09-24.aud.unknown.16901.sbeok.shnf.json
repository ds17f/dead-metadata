I have had this show and was waiting to burn it for a good listen.  The listen occurred today on my drive home from work.  40 something graying Dead head with entirely too much responsibility.  This a simply a killer, smokin, rippin show.  Jerry and Bob are belaying and challenging with affection.  Energy is really high.  The tempo is level and mellow with ooodles of thunder juice from Phil, Bill and Mickey.  The Playin-Sup-Playin to end the 1st set, represents everything that good in this life!  No to mention the otherworldly sequence of Help-Slip-Drums-Slip-Franklins-Music!!!!!!!  Stop the madness.  This is the kind of inspired Dead that reminds us of those feelings of pure astonishment where we all agree that there really is nothing like a Grateful Dead show.  The recording is great if you like audience shows...which I do.  I need to give this show a 5 for the exploratory pots and pans kinda rowdy killer show this is.   Peace.",

From 6.3.76 to 10.31.84, The Boyz did Lazy Lightening > Supplication 121 times in a row without exception.  Woops, excuse me...  Only ONE time did they precede Supp with anything but Lazy, and that time was 9.24.76.  And man, what an improvisation!  \n\nI would love to have seen the interplay between The Guyz fighting it out for who's song was going to win the seque.   You can clearly hear Bobby's Supplication rhythm gaining prominance while they're thumping it out at the end of the Playing Jam. So Phil and Jerry gave it up, and Bobby won the hand. :-) \n\nHave you ever drawn a straight flush - all in a row - as you open the cards?  I did once with Jack high diamonds. It's dumbfounding. I almost fell out of my chair.  That's the way this feels.  I just shake my head and laugh at how amazing the seque is into Supp.  As a purely unique animal, it's what every trooblooo Head dreams of stumbling onto.  And for the fact that they never did it again... they simply didn't need to.  Thank god for this marvelous tape!  The five stars is meant only for this magic moment in GD history.  \n\nThe H/S/F is a good one. Drumz splitting up Slipknot in the second set makes for a nice change of routine in the rotation, but the rest of the show is only fair, or yes, \"unremarkable.\"  Add the H/S/F as filler to a few disks.

What a treat.\n\nIt's pretty good - the transition is interesting as one other person noted.  However, Supplication itself is left to be desired - there are numerous versions out there that are tighter, the guys are on queue, they hit their lyrical and musical notes.  But it's bearable.  Worth adding it to your library.  I may not download the entire show (4 star quality out of 5), but I will download these songs for the archive.\n\nIt's interesting that Jerry didn't necessarily want to go into Supplication, and he started playing the main Playin' theme right at the end of the first Playin song.  The transition is pretty good but they do kind of ramble for a few minutes until they get straight up into Supp.",

They never played William and Mary Hall again after someone at the College made the mistake of scheduling the April 78 concert the same weekend as Parent's weekend!  \nYes, The Hall has great acoustics, and it was a shame.  What's even more of a shame to me anyway, was I grew up within walking distance of the Hall and didn't get turned onto the Grateful Dead until just after the April 78 show.  I saw other concerts there, but never the Grateful Dead.  Hampton 79 was my full initiation, and it was a good one.",

Regardless, I have listened to the many years of Dead for a decade now! 1976 has made an impression as a spry and springy year. This show is heart melting and heart warming. The acid in the water is supper jazzy and even has some really cool break beats in the drumming. The playin-supp-playin is a genuine piece of musical brilliance. I have to say that I do like Donna and the TLEO is the best ever IMHO. Donna and Bob sing it like they mean it and the playing is soaring and swinging. The h-s-franks is freaking white hot... I had to explain to my girlfriend about how cool it is when the whole crowd cracks and sizzles like fireworks in the middle of an instrumental jam end of the world style.

      "review_text": "The Best Franklin's Tower Ever? Too bad that this very good audience recording couldn't have been a Betty Board, because it blows almost all of the other 1976 shows completely out of the water in terms of the sheer energy and creativity associated with Help Slip Franklins and Playin in The Band/Supplication/Playin.  The crowd is obviously electrified and that is reflected back and forth between band and crowd.  If ever there was a real opportunity to make a matrix this would be one of them, if only the soundboard would surface from somewhere?!  Then Charlie Miller would step in and bring out the vocals and guitar more and perhaps create one of the best shows of the mid seventies? I would say that this is worth the download for sure and that if you can toy with the sound yourself you can still come out sounding pretty damn good on a decent stereo with a little EQ.  Other than the fact that this is not a super clean soundboard it really deserves 5 stars.  The piano during HSF gets wild, improvisational and will likely elicit a fat smile...and as for the previous, tightwad reviewer \" L. Rosley \" who rated this show as 3 stars and as \"Unremarkable\" I have to say it... ( and usually I don't like to stomp on the opinions of others )... but ARE YOU DAFT?!  This is not even remotely close to \"Unremarkable.\"  The band and the crowd are vibrant and other than not being a crystal clean soundboard, this is a topmost tier 1976 show.",

I've been in the \"Hall\" many times for many different functions. Graduations (Lafayette High), basketball games and concerts (Stone Temple Pilots), and fell in love with the city as I grew up there. I miss it for sure, now that I have lived in Myrtle Beach for 15 years. By the time I left the \"burg\", I became an avid Grateful Dead fan, only by the upbringing of my ancestor heads. Lisening to this show not only sparks memories of being in the \"Hall\", but I was totaly blown out of my chair playing Big River. I scrolled down and proceded to play Minglewood, holly cow! Decided to peek at Music, no F-ing way! Last but least, U.S. Blues. I was going to soil my-self! \nAs a young dead head at 14, I definatly got my paws on a few bootlegs, Barton Hall '77, which happened to be 6 days after I was born, this show is up there in all qualities. As a matter of fact, this show musically, everyone is playing with a little \"english\" so to say. Jerry is adding in stuff, so is Keith, Bobby, Phil, everyone! Thats magical! Being a musician, I thought this show so far has my gratest approval! Enjoy what my hometown can and has offered all of us \"Heads\"....peace\n\nI give this 5 stars for proformance inovation, and the quality takes me back for personal experience!",

They played Duke the night before. It's a looks-good-on-paper show and a must-hear-once (due to the Help>Slip>Franklins>MNS>Stella. Again, that's Franks into MNS into Stella...). Overall, though, it's an average '76 show, not in the top 20  [like, say 6/29 or 6/9].\n\nFirst Set. Jer is very low in the mix and Bobby is basically missing until <i>Sugaree</i> when things get settled. <i>Row Jimmy</i> is not an engaging version in particular but <i>Big River</i> is major inventive - the old standby that always perked up Jer. <i>Tennessee</i> is sluggish - not my favorite from '76, with it's carousel solo, but I think some will dig this one. <i>Playin'</i> is solid but going into <i>Supplication</i> makes it interesting (they played it into Let it Grow when they were here in Tidewater in '86). Getting it there is a classic struggle and it's one of the many gotta-hear-onces. Back into Playin' it becomes very fluid and organic.\n\nSecond Set. Average stuff, slowly getting hotter, which really shows at <i>Minglewood</i> and a great <i>Help on the Way</i>. The post-Drums <i>Slipknot!</i> has an interesting, jazzy jam, making a half hour Help>Slip>Franks. The Franks is the actual meat and the  show peak, going into <i>Music Never Stopped</i>. The rest is average with <i>Around & Around</i> slowed down and funkified.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0 C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nHelp on the Way>Slipknot!>Franklin's Tower>The Music Never Stopped - a helluva top-notch sequence \n\nSOURCES: The AUD or <b>Dave's 4</b> - which is patched with the AUD.

It\u2019s not a really sub-par show by any means but of the 41 shows from 76, this probably ranks around 25th-30th. \n\nThat said, the Help> Slip> Franklins is an absolute beast. It\u2019s technically Help> Slip> Drums> Slip> Franklins. The short composed section that provides the transition from the Slip jam to Franklins is the first 1:30 of the Franklins track here. I mentioned it because Jerry plays the Slipknot! licks, at a mind blowing speed, perfectly clean. There are no other examples like this. A couple in 1983 are seriously fast but not clean like this. As someone who has played guitar for 26 years and knows these licks well, I am unsure how he was physically able to pull it off. The dexterity and control while riding the edge of the cliff is supremely impressive. \n\nThat\u2019s just the final 90 seconds. The Slip is awesome start to end. Loaded with fly by the seat of your pants dead. A triumphant Franklins is joyful and provides a great roundness to this version. So listen to this show or don\u2019t, but absolutely do not skip the H>S>F!!!\n\n",

How they go from a straight ahead 4/4 rhythm into the 7/8 of Supplication and make it sound seamless is beyond me.  It's just fantastic stuff.  So is the Help > Slip > Drums >Slip >Franklin's in the second set.  Music Never is pretty darn hot as well, hard to believe it's under 6 minutes long, there's so much hotness.
