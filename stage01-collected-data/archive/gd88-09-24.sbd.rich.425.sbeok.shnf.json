While it is cool to hear some of these songs with the various guests they had, specifically Rooster, Chinese Bones and What's Going On, there really isn't much here worth keeping.  Jerry's voice is so beat that it ruins every one of his songs.  While the sound quality is excellent, I would reccomend only downloading some of the songs for fillers. 4 stars for novelty and sound, 0 stars for excitement and poor Jerry's voice for the last show of the east coast tour.

      "review_text": "Ok, I have to defend this one This is my first review, so please bear with me. I was at this show as well as the 22nd. While the 22nd was much better musically, which is of such great importance to me as a fan of the Dead's music, this show had a sweetness that I think is being overlooked. Not only was it an important Benefit Show, the way the other Bhoys came to Jerry's rescue vocally was something I will never forget. It was the kind of stuff we all loved the Bhoys for. True teamwork. As a musician myself that's what it's always about....everybody playing off each other, inspiring each other and making it happen, or not happen, together. Covering each other's mistakes or shortcomings, and accentuating, or trying to, each other's moments of brilliance.\nJerry's voice was shot and that is a testament to how the Dead organization, and WE the deadheads, pushed him too much. He needed rest, not tour after tour. But yeah, I know, Jerry may have been the first to protest playing less.\nYou can say what you like about the guests and all, but afterall, this was a Benefit Show. And I had one of the greatest moments of my life at this show. My friend and I looked at each other again and again and asked \"Is it?\" \"Is that Mick Taylor?\" And yeah, it was. To see Jerry and Mick together, two of my favourite guitarists, both with that meandering style I love, play Rooster together was one of those moments when you say, Yeah, this is IT. I was, and still am, so happy I was there. To my knowledge this is the only time Mick played with the Bhoys and I am eternally grateful I was there for it.\nSo, say what you like, I understand, it doesn't sound like a great show, but in its defence I will say there were extremely important, and sweet, moments. Thanks for bearing with me.\nThe four stars are simply for the things I've described.",

I'm surprised Sting wasn't around though I do seem to remember Jerry giving some tracks to a disc for a like-minded cause, and the Dead allowing 'Throwing Stones' to be used for a Greenpeace double-disc set. \n\n1st Set: I can't believe that \"Neighborhood Girls\" opened this show?! Plenty of busy same-sounding acoustic strummings amplify a descriptive Suzanne Vega number. \"...from all of us from this side of the stage,back, thank you NY - the Grateful Dead. They march their way into a standard professional \"Iko.\" Yea, that sensibility also mars an otherwise fine \"Stranger.\" Seemingly, not that enthused to be onstage at MSG considering they've been doing so quite fine by themseleves for the past 8 of 12 evenings. A hoarse-y Jerry, \"We'd like to invite Mick Taylor out to play with us.\" It's crunchy, busy and guitariffic on \"West LA.\" \"Rooster\" is also very capable, but they're something vibing off the music that's givin me an ehhhh.. Each musician finds a nice nuance to provide a couple of small pleasures during \"Box.\" More pokey please with \"ramble.\" Jerry loses 80% of his voice 2:05 in. Bobby's singing \"Masterpiece\" well but it's listless. \"Ease\" is a quick way for the men to exit without Jerry having to embarass himself further by singing.  \n\n2nd Set: \"This song is by Robyn Hitchcock and is called 'Chinese Bones.'\" Imagine sitting by a stream after ditching work for the day on a Wednesday afternoon... uh huh. Vega's voice is identifiable but lacks strength and a woman's force. However, the music twinkles and wouldn't be a bad option for an extended make-out session. Ahhh...this is where \"Neighborhood Girls\" belongs as she introduces it. A wise-ass dude then pipes up, \"I love 'Neighborhood Girls.'\" Anyways, 'this version' of the show appropriately moves into something \"Crazy.\" Jerry's voice is shot. Let the smackdown upon the lips continue. And to ensure no move we make will be taken as 'pushing our luck' we'll complement them with a little \"Women Smarter.\" But she's determined to break up this idyllic afternoon. So make her feel guilty by picking up your handy accordian and cheese her back with Hall & Oates, \"Every Time You go Away\" a 6:38 song that should have gone no longer than 4. Full musical accompaniment for \"Thank you. we'd like to do another song, bless his heart, from Marvin Gaye who wrote a song in the seventies that means as much today,\" for \"What's Going On.\" It sure sounds like Bobby/Jerry are using similiar \"Eyes\" tones for this tune. Full blown -out affair that segues into \"Drums\" with Baba Olatunji's chantings & Michael Hinton's percussion and bird calling talents. \"Space\" was short...not wanting to scare off the non-Deadheads in attendance, I guess... leading to a lesson we can all take to heart, \"The Wheel.\" It gets sloppy near the end and the singing wasn't all that. \"Throwing\" is clear-headed and easy to get all pumped up about and its partner \"NFA\" flows well yet only skims the surface of its potential. \nThat's it... no 'Good Lovin' finale or 'Knockin' encore :( \n\n2 4/5th stars rounded up for novelty",

They did the Aiko-Aiko and Women are smarter because the fans were clapping the 5 clap so loud.

I wonder if they ever did all 3 of those songs every in one show other than this?  If they did was it the dead's choice or the crowd.  Last note they did hang a banner inside MSG this night for the Dead.  It was for their 25th show at MSG.  After that night I never saw the banner again.

Jerry's voice is just awful, and as Trannyman said he's in need of some serious bed rest. And despite the presence of Nigerian wonder drummer Babatunde Olatunge, drums just isn't what it could be. Nothing is \"on\" this night. But I would check out the Vega sung songs Neighborhood Girls and the Robin Hitchcock cover Chinese Bones and the respectable Hall And Oates numbers What's Going On by Marvin Gaye and Every Time You Go Away.

      "review_text": "Settle Down Easy Another very decent big hall soundboard show. Not the best of a setlist, but the band is out on the road and playing for the masses, and that's what makes almost any of their shows an enjoyable event.\n I sure hope the happy campers that leave the angry reviews about all the 80's shows are reviewing with a bit of humor (and hopefully a bit more of an open mind). The terrible set lists had to include the 80's influenced albums the band was putting out (music that they knew that they had to tweek to sound like all the other ungodly music being played on the air during this time period).\n Also, you need to keep in mind that the band was a band and the music was a joint effort to present over, and over and over and over again across the U.S. (mostly) 70-80 times a year. So, if the music is such a drag (for you to listen to or deal with), don't listen to this period. The band would be getting just as much grief if they played the same sets (of constant 60's and 70's material) all the time. Come on, cut the boys some slack. At least Donna isn't on any more shows past the 1979 or so.",

The big video screen flashing the rainforest imagery to the music made a powerful impact.  I remember thinking at the time that it was the best use of music video I'd ever seen.\n\nBeing swept away by the experience, I didn't notice at the time how sloppy and lackluster the Dead's performance actually was.  What a disappointment hearing the recording of this show. ",
