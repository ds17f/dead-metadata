They do some FUNNY voice exercises at first and then they start telling the crowd to say things like fuck, dope, primape, and what? And I think it's Phil who says this really funny way of sayin what that reminds me of elmer fud. And then I think it's Phil who tells the crowd to say \"OOOOOOOH No!\" and he says that in a VERY VERY comic tone. It's absolutely gut busting, grateful dead good-ness.

      "review_text": "Vintage material indeed! There are any number of \"Holy Grails\" out there depending on the reviewer; for me~ this is it.  This is the '67 performance that lives up to my imagination.  The jam factor of hot & hungry musicians, the fun factor of a young irreverent dance-band, & the rich psychedelia of serious acid-rock pioneers.  So great to hear a live Golden Road!, with spirited vocals by Jerry~ and then the transition into New Potato--a fully realized showpiece even here(why didn't they play it at Monterey...?)--is as seemlessly masterful as any they'd later be famous for as such transitions became trademark.  And awesome Alligator!!!  The \"Alligator\" vocal chorus is exuberant, and as this performance doesn't lead into Caution, it stands on its own as a vehicle for the manic musical exploration that ensues.\nI love Mickey, but let no one tell me it became Grateful Dead music only with his joining.  The proof's in the pudding, and here it is.  You'll lick your spoon, guaranteed. \nBilly is smoking, and while the sound quality isn't up to official release standards, the mix retains a richness nevertheless.  Certainly no caveats here that should stand in your way from treating yourself to this vintage performance.",

      "review_text": "A Treasure my 2\u00a2 worth . . .\n\nPretty good little (portion of a?) show!  Apparently it's not known what the whole setlist consisted of. Luckily four songs, almost 40 years later, exist for us to groove on and enjoy today.\n\nHe Was A Friend Of Mine opens this recording on a nice, mellow note.  If this was somehow the first song in the show and someone was seeing the Dead for their first time, wow, they'd have no clue what they were in for!  Friend Of Mine cuts off near the end and cuts into the band in between numbers, bantering probably under the influence of, well . . . items of interest to those seeking hallucinogenic enlightenment.  That fun couple of minutes goes into a nearly lightning fast but sweet Golden Road.\n\nThe first notes of New Potato kick in as Golden Road comes to a close and we soon hear Bobby yell out, \"This number's for Laughlin.\"\n\nNow, after a little internet research, I found nothing to tell me definitively who this Laughlin person is.  Closest I can figure the name refers possibly to a 60's Bay Area guy named Chandler A. Laughlin a.k.a. Travus T. Hipp.\n\nBack in that era Laughlin helped open the Cabale Creamery on San Pablo Ave. in Berkeley.  In early '66 the Dead had a show scheduled there but it was cancelled.  Later the Cabale became the Questing Beast where the Dead may or may not have rehearsed.  Once upon a time a tape was in circulation labeled \"Questing Beast\" but it's since been determined that those sessions are from another date and location.  Interestingly, The Beast closed down on May 9, right about the time the May 5th Fillmore show was thought (but not definitively known) to have taken place . . . uh, except The Beast is said to have closed in '66 (according to www.chickenonaunicycle.com) and this show is from '67.  Hmmm.\n\nOkay, so perhaps Bobby's shout out to Laughlin is for the following (which appears on www.fatchance.org) -- \"Chased across the Mexican border twice by the FBI for subversive associations and drugs, and back once by the Federales of that noble nation for somewhat the same reasons, Hipp finally fell afoul the law and was doing a short term of county time when he was bailed out by the legendary Tom Donahue to go to work for KMPX, America's premier FM rock station in 1967.\"\n\nUntil I ask around some more and maybe find out from someone who knows, the true meaning of Laughlin will remain a mystery to me.\n\nIn any case, the Golden Road segue into New Potato Caboose is almost as quiet and mellow as He Was a Friend of Mine, really not at all indicitive of what's to come.  On a down side, the vocals in the mix are almost lost behind the music, almost a little muddy.  Thankfully, it's not the vocals that I'm listening for!  Once the lyrics are done with, at about the three minute mark, the song quickly picks up a ton of steam and blasts so well into a cataclysmic atomic shebang.  While the vocals aren't all there, the smile on my face along with the feeling I had made me fully aware the music is all there!!!\n\nAlligator rolls forward in a very similar fashion.  Once the seemingly half-hidden vocals are out of the way after the first few minutes of the song, the music picks up some intense primitive Dead strength cranking into the final screams of \"Allligatorrrrrrrrrrr . . . Alligatorrrrrrr,\" it's clear what a contrast the last two songs are in comparison to the first.\n\nGreat audio quality for the era and seeing as how there's so little '67 Dead to listen to, this is 31 minutes to be nothing less than treasured.",

      "review_text": "A glimpse into the Summer of Love I write this on the 40th anniversary of the Summer of Love from the Haight, now a very different place than it was then. There are vestiges, such as the Sunday tribal gatherings at Hippy Hill in Golden Gate Park, but the 710 Ashbury crashpad sold for several million a few years ago.\n\nBut during that Summer, a local band called Dead were not yet national rock stars, but people waking up to what was happing, coming here in droves and hearing this band that played like nothing they ever heard.\n\nThis recording epitomizes that Summer. The stage remarks (\u201cI just saw a narc down in the audience\u201d) and the outbursts of the second cut reveal the state of mind they were in, probably the same as the audience, as someone below pointed out. After some wild banter they go into a tight version of Golden Road. Not too many live recordings of the Golden Road, and this is a great one. Goes to show that they had a lot of practice of playing while tripping. The vocals are amazingly on key as well.\n\nThe psychedelic ensemble jamming is incredible, intense, exciting, and not repetitive. They play as one unit, all equal partners, not dominated by Jerry: Bill, Jerry, even Pigpen who is just amazing on keyboards here, and Phil, who is on fire the way that all but disappeared after \u201874.\n\nThis recording may be a remnant of a longer show, or this may be the entire set of a night of music shared with Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, and Moby Grape. The remarkable thing was that unlike these other bands, the Dead lasted beyond the Summer by innovation and changing and growing as musicians, lasting 27 more years. But this Summer of Love show is more than a time capsule, as it stands the test of time.",

He is a journalist and is on KPIG radio and another station, out of the Reno area, with a morning news commentary. I highly doubt this show is from May '67. I had this tape years ago, but it was unlabled. My best guess is August or early Sept, as there's no Mickey. Would also make sense with the song selection and the progression of Caboose & Alligator. The Kings Beach shows would make sense, as it's in Travus' nearby vicinity. I haven't seen Red Dog Saloon listed in deadbase or deadlists, yet supposedly they played there also.\n\nAlso of note, just this past month, Travus T Hipp's house was raided by Lyon County NV sheriff's, where they seized 4 oz of pot, some peyote (which he claimed to have had for years) and a hand gun.

(It also resembles the 8/4 and 9/3 Alligators in that it stops without going into Caution.)\nNew Potato, this is just a hunch, but I think this performance is more developed than the 8/4/67 New Potato - I think 8/4 is the earliest New Potato we have, since it has a much shorter jam. \nSo I'd speculate that \"5/5/67\" is actually from August/September '67 sometime.

Today it remains one of my favorite shows to hear, regardless of what date or event it actually was. The \"Alligator\" in particular is one of my favorites, a very funky rendition. The banter is also terrifyingly stoned and hilarious.",

      "review_text": "Different Order So my version of this tape had it listed at the U of Oregon........I guess not. That always did seem strange.\n\nI got it off a reel to reel from a friend who's brother is supposed to be in the picture on Aoxomoxoa and who Cosmic Charlie is named for (but I doubt it). Though for what its worth, that same friend had a Phil bass circa 72 or so that I saw with my own eyes.\n\nMy song progression was Golden Road > New Potato > Alligator > He Was..\n\nIt is an amzing tape that opens up a view in to a world that few of us saw. Personally, I was 1 yo when this stuff was done, living in of all places Lucas Valley in Marin County.\n\nI listened to this just yesterday as I was driving my mom's old car that only has a tape deck (and yet only 38k miles). The tranistion in to New is simply amazing.....just a sign of everything else yet to come.\n\nThe big question for me is where did they get the idea to do that???? Connect one sont to another via improvisation. Improv was big in Jazz, but not from song to song. Never has been.\n\nUniquely American and uniquely Grateful Dead.",

      "review_text": "The Grateful Dead: Show #154 No, not an Acid Test. Skipped quite a chunk of time since the last show appears on Archive. Again, not a great recording, but it sure does the job. Rumors of some of the songs belonging to 1967-09-29 (Mickey's first show), which have fallen short of evidence... I don't hear Mickey, but that's just me. Could also belong to a different date entirely, but this is obviously the best theory so far.\n\nMost sources point to He Was A Friend Of Mine occurring after Alligator, so that's the order I'll use. Also rumors of the infamous 2 hour Alligator>Caution, but more lack of evidence seeing as the song has a \"clear\" ending (as great as this Alligator may be). A great Phil recording anyhow.",

However, as a musician and an AVID dead head this is one of those shows that you sit back close your eyes and smile... \"if you get it\"... I can feel the raw energy and it gives me goosebumps - the high paced Golden Road into a face-melting Potato is just unbelievable. Such a priceless gem that I feel so lucky to have been able to hear. \nYou know its a gem of a show when you can genuinely feel yourself there - through space and time - watching the boys tear it up!!\nMuch love and peace to all my friends!\n\nP.s - if anyone is looking to download theres https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/flash-video-downloader/?src=search which you can add-on to Mozilla and it rips the audio and downloads it right to your computer!\n\nGoodluck and if anyone needs help just email b.priddy @ Umiami . edu",

      "review_text": "All graceful instruments are known! This is a priceless half hour of Grateful Dead music. It's a true time capsule that shows how great they already were just a couple years into the game. There are lengthy passages in New Potato Caboose and Alligator where Weir topples crafty chords into Phil's mashing bass line in a fashion that would soon make them world famous. Kreutzmann's artistic drumming is fantastic, and Pigpen's organ work gives a subtle, half rhythmic, half melodic warmth to the show. And then there's a young Jerry Garcia, already conjuring up some of the finest guitar work people would ever hear. That first solo in He Was A Friend of Mine is pure brilliance, and it's a shame we can't hear the full song, because they were really carrying the jam into a beautiful space. 50+ years later, 5/5/67 never gets old - classic shows like this one are still in their own special league. I wish we had the full show, but something about the brevity of this recording adds to the charm. The banter, the excitement, and the novelty of 5/5/67 make it essential listening for anyone interested in this era!",

      "review_text": "Alas, This Golden Road Is Not Accepted Into My Library The last live Golden Road as everyone mentions. But it\u2019s really really hard listening to Golden Road live, I love it so much.  Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) is a two minute, balls-to-the-wall, hypersonic missile of youth and masculine testosterone that always comes close to being an out-of-control mess with every attempt.  The song reminds me allot of what jet airplanes go through trying to break the sound barrier.  I feel personally, they only broke that barrier once in the studio for their first album. And I just can\u2019t listen to any of the live versions. I WANT that shock wave. I NEED that shock wave of controlled quality! All other live versions never could break 770 MPH - shuddering - to then break up and explode into a million pieces. \n\nI can appreciate everyone lauding over Golden Road. It is a masterpiece. But their needs to be a little control of the vocal and/or recording instruments to get the plane\u2019s wings past Mach 1. I have to honestly admit that this version is a good one. But the sound quality is low with the SBD being a bit oversaturated and distorted. And that\u2019s a damn shame.  Because if the board had been better, I would have kept it, adding some reverb to soften Jerry\u2019s very up-front vocals. New Potato and Alligator do not have this distortion problem, so I kept them.\n",
