One of my top 5 for 1977.Highlights - a HOT HOT Music,a sweet Terrapin,a near-reggae FOTD and a rare Wheel>Wharf Rat seque where Jerry's playing is over the top!!

His two major solos in Half Step are astonishing (equals and perhaps exceeds 11-5-77).  It's so big, you feel they could understandably end the set right there.  But instead, they launch into Big River (in his main solo, Garcia is so revved up he takes off and nearly leaves the drummers a beat behind him).  The sound quality is exquisite; from song to song, you can hear well at least a little from everyone.  Clearly a band at the top of their game.",

I reccomend it to anyone who seminally enjoys '77 dead. In particular, I would say the peggy-o is awesome, one of the best may '77 versions, and the terrapin station is excellent. The overall tightness is incredible. This version of terrapin is one that I listened to at least 5 times in a row. The rest of the show is excellent, as well as the recording is.

I have to say again as I've said before...Jerry's tone is amazing!  March - June 1977 Jerry had the best tone I've ever heard from anyone to this date.  I would recommend all shows from the MArch Winterland run through June 1977 to all deadheads...and to newbies looking for the reason this magnificent band had/and still has so many devoted fans.\n\nThe biggest highlight for me here is the Terrapin!!!

They could have gave it up at the 6:48 mark but Mickey/Bill ratchet it up, Phil drops in effortless set-up notes and Jerry takes the slam. The band slam isn't all though- Jerry does scrambled eggs before giving it up. Absolute perfection. \n\nJerry gets lost once on the second section vocal for a sec but what a killer solo to close it out.

A rowsing version of The Music Never Stopped ends the first set with a bang. The second set opener Terrapin is appropriately majestic and the following Samson is as powerful as Samson ever got in the wonderful year of 1977. From then on it's jamming bliss, the highpoint of which for me is The Wheel and Wharf Rat jams, just stellar.

There is a reason why this show has been downloaded 308,000+ times  (2nd download for this show on archive.org).  The 1st download (Bertha remaster by Rob Eaton, The Wizard, and Jay Ashley) is the best-sounding version, so download that one.  There is some extra tuning/equipment problems before and after some songs, but that only makes this concert better than all the others.  And believe me, this was no warm-up for Barton Hall.  In fact, the Boston Garden and Buffalo Memorial Auditorium book-end shows were the best shows of the 3-night stand, IMHO.  Yes, Barton Hall is good, but the audio and quality of the Boston Garden show is off-the-hook!!\n\nThe Barton Hall show was downloaded 126,000+ times.  Compare that to the Boston Garden show that was downloaded 308,000+ times.  I have the Palladium 4/30 flac (lossless) show that I purchased from the deadnetstore.com.  The quality is out-of-this-world!  Guess what?  The quality from the Boston Garden show sounds almost, if not as good, IMHO (and its not even lossless).\n\nNow for the show  First of all, forget about the equipment repairs that last several minutes in between some of the songs.  They only helped the perfection of this awesome concert, as well.  When you burn your _vbr.mp3s to disk, you dont have to burn the equipment repair fillers, anyway.  The 1st set is as good as any 1st set Ive heard.  Bertha  Cassidy  Deal  Jack Straw is smokin!  Peggy-O is definitely a top-3 of all time, and New Minglewood Blue sounds better than the Barton Hall version, without a doubt!\n\nNow we get to Mississippi Half-Step.  Another user stated he thought the best Half-Steps were from 80 and 81 until he heard this one.  I couldnt echo that any more!  This Half-Step is without a doubt, the fucking bomb!!  I have NEVER heard Garcias guitar transcend my mind like it does on this song!  Absolutely, breathtaking!  If anyone can find a better Half-Step, then Id sure like to know!  It actually reminds me of Jerrys guitar on the Dark Star from Live Dead.  Its that good, folks!!  Big River, Jed and TMNS round out the 1st set, that just doesnt let up!\n\nAnd the 2nd set is about as good as Ive heard for a 2nd set.  Terrapin into Sampson just blows me away!  Friend of the Devil and Estimated Prophet will have you jammin no matter what you are doing.  Eyes of the World is very good and Drums is not drawn out, but Eyes is certainly not a top-10.  However, The Wheel leading into a 15-1/2 minute Wharf Rat is ridiculous and one for the ages!  Around and Around is solid, but the U.S. Blues culminates this show into a top-5 show of all time, IMHO.  By the way, Jerry breaks a string before U.S. Blues, but fixes it before the finale.\n\nPeople have commented on the equipment problems during this show.  As far as Im concerned, it only made this show better because so much tuning was done before most songs that only made the songs sound that much better!  The only minor flaws in this show is a slight feedback at the beginning of Bertha, and Jack Straw only lasted 5 minutes.  But that is me just being picky!  LOL\n\nGo listen to Barton Hall, and then listen to Boston Garden.  If the 5/7 Boston Garden had a version of Scarlet > Fire from the 5/8 Barton Hall show added to the 2nd set, then this Boston Garden show may have been the best show of all-time!  Definitely would have been the best show in 1977.  If they only could have played Good Lovin after Bertha before Cassidy!  OMG!!  Can you imagine that??\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",
