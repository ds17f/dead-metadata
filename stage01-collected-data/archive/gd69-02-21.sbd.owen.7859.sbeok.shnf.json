This is yet another raging 69 with all the typical fare they were playing those days. The \"problem\" being that \"typical\" actually equals stellar. This tape came out back in the 90s along with the Avalon shows from April and the Aqua Theatre show from August. I got the cassettes all together in one trade of brand new recently surfaced stuff labelled \"Not For Trade\"... you know... secret stuff wasn't supposed to get out or about don't give to anyone else type of thing... This is better quality. Phil calls someone \"you motherfucker\" at the end of Doin That Rag and continues yelling at him into Dark Star.

I never once heard anyone use the word \"sick\" in all of my 118 shows and several complete tours I did beteween '82-'86.\n\nPlease help out us true deadheads kids, save the slang for the Pearl Jam forum, this is the Grateful Dead.  There is a big difference.  Very big.\n\nI have had most of '69 on tape for years and I recommend both Vallejo shows highly.  As othjers have said this is one of the very hot Eleven's of all-time.",

The Dark Star is very \"tasty\"  The St Stephen is \"totally radical\"  The Eleven is \"on the money\" \"fer shure, fer shure\"  Jerry is totally \"ragin'\" \n\nand on and on.  People of all types use descriptive adjectives to imply different things.  Like the word \"BADASS\"  back in the 80's when you were on tour BADASS was one of those words.  As in BADASS show--the show had no real badasses (besides the Hells Angels) but badass describes something that was extraordinary.  Remember ever hearing the words \"Cats Pajamas\" or \"Bee's Knees\"?  I would not say that anymore yet it was in total fashion when our parents were kicking around.  There are plenty of words that we will not understand that our kids and their friends will kick at us that will go over our heads.\n\nSICK is a completely on the money adjective in my opinion to describe this set.  SICK!!!\n\nDude, don't bag on people because you don't understand them or call them gay.  NOT COOL. You should know that by now.  You should have learned that somewhere on the road (to unlimited devotion) back during those 118 shows.\n\nPEACE and LIGHT!\nAlfred",

I am sorry you have never heard of this before. You were very lucky to have seen the Dead, but you were just another 2nd generation hippy that didn't see Pigpen or Keith, so that dosen't mean much to me. I love shows from the '82-'86 era, but you weren't seeing the \"sick\" shows of the 60's and 70's so I wouldn't act like you are some true Deadhead.\n\nSince we're learning things here...did you know \"Teabaging\" is a slang term that means you like to put your balls in other mens mouths while they sleep? HAHAHA THAT'S YOUR NAME! TEABAGGER! HAHAHA! \n\nSure, I was born in '85 and I've only seen the Dead and Ratdog, but I have over 600 shows on CD and I probably know more about the history of the Dead than you do. Can you even tell me what amps or effects pedals Garcia used? Don't be a douche Teabagger. It dosen't even really matter how much you know, just how much you love the Dead. You need to chill out Teabagger! Like when I think of \"true\" Deadhead I think of a guy dressed in a Hessian Revolutionary War uniform dancing in Golden Gate Park in 1967. Or maybe someone who attended Watkins Glen, Winterland shows from '69, or the Euro Tour of '72. Not you Teabagger. Keep your balls out of people's mouths!",

The Dead's sound in 1969 was sublime. They were raw, full of vigor and the exploratory energy of youth. Though it can be argued that technique improves with age, nothing compares to the passion of youth.\n\nSo let's all bring back the good times people. It is not too late to go back to the past and learn what we have forgotten or were never taught. \n\nBetter learn to duck, cause we are gonna need it to survive in this Orwellian future. There are not enough of us to fight amongst ourselves!\n\nPeace.",

In all moments is the searing truth of life, holistic, all as one together in the explosive noises rampantly dancing through an infinite canvas upon our ears that paints the scene of what all is- all combined as one, holistic, the SEARING TRUTH OF LIFE!... and the Dead come forth with their instruments to dance beyond the stage, bringing with them the intrinsic inner-workings of an eternal dance- the music, through them! 1969 is quite a rush, blurring by with an accuracy unforseen by the Dead throughout the rest of their career... What an epitomizing moment this concert encompasses",
