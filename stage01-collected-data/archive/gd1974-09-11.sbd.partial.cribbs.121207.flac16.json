You beauty ............. after the 'Live/Dead' \"Dark Star\" (plus St. Stephen -> The Eleven -> Turn On Your Lovelight) this is my favourite 'Dead Suite'.\n\nI have listened to the unique \"Eyes of the World\" so many times, I guess I probably know it 'note for note', off by heart. But the first time was the best - I was there. But not just unique 'cos I was there, unique 'cos after the Phil and Ned 'Knee-Trembler', Ned continued to take the lead into \"Eyes\", before Jerry resumed normal service. Listen carefully, you can hear Ned on the shriller (think Brent) electric piano while Keith supplies the deeper fills on the 'grand'. And all the time, Phil, Bob and Billy are driving it along, leaving Jerry, Ned and Keith to add the icing on the cake.\n\nI could go on (and bore the pants off you) but I'm gonna stop here and give my ears a treat, I suggest you do the same.\n\nRating ? Need you ask ? I know everyone gives 5 stars to shows they went to (unless they were cancelled!) but, in this case, it's fully justified.\n\nThank you Mr. Cribbs (Gans, etc.,).",

Serious symmetry happening and Jerry just seems to bending the strings a little differently this particular evening. This is, and has been, hands down my favorite going on at least two years now. Damn near perfect imo...\n\nAs good of sound as any '74 sbd out there. Remarkable chunk right here cleaned up nicely. I would tend to Believe this was the source Gans used when he interviewed Ned in 2001. 5 star Eyes all day. Amongst the best of the best.",

      "review_text": "special night Dig out Gans' interview with Ned for some very telling anecdotes about the state of the band on this night.  Priceless stuff.  This source, fyi, has the same music as the previously circulating full show, minus the aud patch of the preceding 15 min of the jam and Phil's setbreak comment after Wharf Rat.  But it's great to have this back and accessible to all!  Great, too, to actually hear Ned's contributions -- by his account, he was present for most jams from the end of June through October, but is missing from the recordings.  The music itself is timeless.",

I can dig that maybe Seastones is generally a bit too...\"challenging\" for some people, but this coupling with Eyes is just one of those moments in GD history that needs to be heard. Worth more than 50 El Pasos on HDCD.",

      "review_text": "Real nice way to spend 80 minutes on a sunny afternoon I have a decades-old cassette of an audience recording of this same set (set II, with a bit of Set III including the Around and Around).  That tape sounds pretty great at loud volume but at ordinary volume it sounds like it was recorded in the bathroom of the venue -- tons of hall reverb.  It must have sounded incredible in the sweet spots, if you were there.\n\nThis soundboard file is a vastly improved experience over that old cassette (but am I mis-remembering that there used to be an audience recording of this set (and more) here in the archive? I don't see it here no more ... ;)\n\nAnyway, just bask in the glory of this, from beginning to end, when you have a bit of time and dope to spare.  These versions ebb and flow like tides ... slow, thick tides of molten gold, orange and olive green.  The Eyes is phenomenal and the transition into Wharf Rat is basically a miniature Dark Star for all time.  Dig Jerry's big laughs after Wharf Rat!\n\nAnother great Europe 74 version of Around and Around brings you back home (the rest of the show is no slouch either:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd1974-09-11.sbd.hamilton.3190.shnf\n\n(the version of PhilNed->Eyes->Rat appears more complete here than the versions embedded in the other files for this show)",

The whole thing is an overlooked gem, goes as far out there as any Dark Star. The rest of the band eventually joins in for some primo '74 chaos! Thanks for sharing this, Sean.",
