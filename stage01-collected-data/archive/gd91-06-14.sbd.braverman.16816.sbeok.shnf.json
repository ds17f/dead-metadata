Needed some \"help\" during set brake as did a beautiful girl a row ahead of me...we both had a \"critters evening\" and found comfort in the shared experience. All I asked for to get me through was the music to start again and then they opened the second set with Help on the Way...couldn't have been more appropriate!!!

I streamed another one for the afternoon.  I have spent all week listening to Bruce-era Dead.  It is very consistent and seems to have just the right touch of everything I need.\n\nWant a dark Star (a good one)?  Check.  Want Lovelight? Check.  Want Jams? Check.  Whatever you want, itsinthere.\n\nThis is a great show.  This period probably represents the last great consistency from Jerry.

That said, I was somewhat disappointed that 6/17, 6/22 or 6/24 (or 6/25 for that matter) were not chosen for the View treatment, because I think they are all superior to this good, not great show.\n\nFirst set has a lot of energy, the \"cowboy\" duo, and especially maggie's farm are hot hot hot, with Hornsby really asserting himself nicely.  Row Jimmy gets out there a little bit, and I can still remember the lower deck stands bouncing up and down during this song, some things you just never forget.\n\nAs for Set 2, on paper it looks killer, but to be honest, in execution not so much.  Franklin's to me is the highlight, just refuses to not rock, but the Dark Star is somewhat uninspired (the only really good post Brent DS's in my opinion are 9/20/90 and 4/1/91) and for those who have the View CD or DVD absolutely PALES in comparison to the monster from 7/12/90.  The short shrift back end with just Stella and Lovelight sorta bummed me out at the time.  All that said, Summer 1991 was a great time to be alive and be a Head, so download this baby, and just let the music play.",

Kind of freaky but otherwis great. Jerry looked like god on the big screen during Stella Blue. The parking lot before and after the was big party cops were really cool, great memories.",

      "review_text": "First Dark Star..... This show highlighted my first Dark Star and first H>S>F. Having been in the twentieth row dead center I remember this show well. Cold Rain was strong and it was clear that the band came to play. Jack-a-roe is not the best I heard and I find this one a bit slow but its still solidly played. Big River seems to be where the energy takes off. Jerry's leads are mixed with both Bruce and Vince. The Row Jimmy was solid though not one of the best I heard live or on tape as far as the \"90\"'s go. It seemed to me that Jerry was having fun with it but not digging in yet. Still, Jerry's solos are there. Bobby picks up the rest of the set with strong versions of Black Throated Wind and Music Never Stopped. This Music was scorched and was one of the best I heard live along with 8/22/93 Oregon. It set the table for what was to come in a similar fashion as 8/22/93 did. The energy level from this Music carried over into a great Help>Slip>Franklins which had the stadium rocking. I remember the band just looking at each other and looking down and wailing this whole thing out. The Estimated kept up the energy level and the Dark Star is short with one verse but short can be sweet and this one was. Phil clearly is having fun with this. A more than decent drums led into a sweet Stella Blue with some good jamming at the end into a smokin Lovelight. Baby Blue is simply beautiful here and was one of the highlights of the night. I recall wishing that there was more coming out of Drums/Space but that did not stop everyone from walking out of RFK in a daze. This show is good though the energy level has its ups and downs but overall, worth getting.",

I was on tour and anxiously awaiting the 2ng set of a kick ass summer tour evening in D.C. Jerry came out with a fan blowing his crazy long hair every which way and was noodling Help On The Way like a crazed man.  He lit into it and played the best Help-Slip-Franknlin's since the 77. You were transported back to the 70's as the band dished out an amazing 2nd set. Buy this disc or find a copy because it is as good as it gets in the 90's. Jerry looked posessed in the giant tv sceens on each side of the stage and he played his guitar the same that night. Thanks Jerry for the memories!",

      "review_text": "Tripped out musclehead dude falling off scaffolding? This was a great show but I vividly remember between sets watching some guy who looked like Lou Ferrigno scale up the soundboard scaffolding in the middle of the field, frequently hanging off by one hand obviously self medicated pretty fully.\nHe got up towards the top and was reaching up grabbing at the pant legs of people on the platform while security from all sides were trying to get him to climb down while also trying to get hold of him to pull him to safety.\nOne of the guards got his hands around one of the guys arms, while another guard was close to getting his other arm.  I think the guy felt in his mind that the guard had him and he just let go of the scaffolding, falling many feet down right onto the metal fence surrounding the structure.  I almost puked it was so disturbing.\nSome 20+ minutes later I was still freaked out and remember my girlfriend asking me if I was alright, trying to comfort me.  Thankfully pretty soon Help on the Way came soaring out from the stage which seemed to be hovering in the wind like a spaceship with Jerry's hair blowing back, it was beautiful.\nI have always been curious as to what happened to that guy.\nIf anyone happens to remember this or knows anything about him I would like to hear. Peace and love, peace and love.",

This one was solid start to finish especially the 2nd set which is fabulous and we didnt have to deal with the rain like 1990. Would have liked to have heard the 2nd verse of Dark Star coming out of Space, and there are even hints of it at the end of Stella, but cant have everything. This certainly is a contender for best of 91.  ",

The Close Song of the Show Love Light ends completely & right before that last note Bobby hits a different Note that sends the band right back into where it started to end the song & the place was already nuts positive, If you watch the video even Bruce Hornsby was getting up from his piano as he thought the song was over but sat back down with a huge grin that he was showing a Wang Dang Doodle all night long.

      "review_text": "Eh... I guess if you dig this era of muddled, dense,  rhythmically inconsistent dead, then this is a good show. IMO, the era of two keys leaves zero space in the sonic landscape, limiting creative jams. Vince playing doesn't do it for me, Hornsby overplays, his accordion is intermediate student level, and the chemistry everyone hails as amazing between he and Jerry sorta sucks to my ears. Especially when Hornsby tries to mimic Garcia phrasing, or worse, quote melodies from other tunes, like some white bread jazz qtet  . Call me a boomer Debbie downer, but the best part of this tour is Jerry's Moses like aesthetic....\n\nWha Wha......\ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd10",
