Their drum rolls during Good Lovin' are unreal; Mickey and Billy are unconscious. Scarlet Begonias is Jerry at his finest. He takes 4 HUGE turns on Scarlet getting higher and higher each time. The Scarlet>Fire transition is probably the best and most inventive ever; Jerry is blistering. Fire is ridiculous. Estimated and Eyes is nuts.\nMandatory Download. \nLast show before Egypt.",

Scarlet fire is it. THis is the finest example i've ever heard being there or on tape end of discusion. You will be taken up the ladder 3 times and bigger sets of chills each time Jerry is on another planet. Put down the mouse and down load do not pass go. THe rest of the show really shines as well but... Did I say scarlet fire.\n\nIf you don't have it get it. THe quality is great by '78 standard. This second set compares with anything in '77 in my opinion. First set is great as well but I find my self putting on Good Livin' and going for the ride again.",

Must've been part of the reason I had such a good time. Must be part of the reason I love listening to these recordings. We were kind of disappointed that after the drums was so short but I guess they had a camel to catch. We all decidsed it must've been the band's idea of a joke to set us loose on the Turnpike while it was still light out. Now I remember selling Dead Roses for $1.00, locking the keys in the trunk, and bringing about 5 gallons of Mongo juice into the stadium. People around us took one look and said noooo thanks. As the afternoon wore on and it got hot they ate a little booze fruit, then it got really hot and they drank the juice. Gotcha ! Great party. One year after Englishtown.",

      "review_text": "...A Grate Time Was Had By All Further to my review of a few years back.......   I've read reviews on all the sources posted and it seems you either loved this show or think they were just going through the motions...   To folks who weren't there and are basing their reviews on quality or recordings or the vibe they think they are getting from the recording, I can assure you that no one was just going through the motions. Not the band, not the fans, and not the music Gods that shined on us from the first notes of the NRPS to the last note of One More Saturday Night.   Did they have Egypt on their minds?  Probably.  Was it scorching hot all day long?  Hell yes.  Was it their first show at the then 2 year old Giants Stadium- -a stadium notorious for circling winds and crappy acoustics?  But, of course.  Long story longer and more tedious, there were plenty of reasons they could have come out unfocused and lazy and played a show like the April '84 shows at New Haven Coliseum.  But they didn't.  For how long and hot a day it was, there is still a lot of tunes with some serious spark. In fact, missing from the 2nd set was the \"dirge\" aka slow tune.... no Stella Blue or Ship of Fools or Wharf Rat or any other of Jerry's tunes that can send you into an emotional free fall.  That 2nd set rocked.  And for how many times I heard FOTD, even that was more energetic than usual.  And the other slow tunes were classic versions - - Peggy-O and LLR.  Folks, not the best show I ever saw.  But definitely worth 4 stars.  So I stand by my 6/21/2005 review, i.e.  Great music.  Amazing how many people I bumped into that day from various walks of life.  High school folks I hadn't seen in 2 year, college friends I didn't know were trekkin' up to NJ for the show [and who my parents were soooo grateful to have camp at their home after the show].  The last Keith and Donna show I saw.... and the last show I dosed at.  Ah yes, it twas a grate day!!!!",

      "review_text": "Jersey Dead It had been a year since the gathering at Englishtown,78 was a heavy tour year for us, this was the east coast gathering prior to the Egypt trip. We were allowed to enter the lot very early. We had a keg, couches and an abundance of Mr Natural. This was a great lot scene, we missed Willie and my Brother had his first dose/show. The only true bummer was the one who jumped to their death from the top of the stadium, my Brother never discussed this show since. I had a blast dancin round and round the inside of the stadium. Solid performances in the first set, althought the list seems like a carbon copy for 78', they delivered with conviction. FOTD, Jack Straw were on time. Yes the Scarlet>Fire still brings back the festive feel of this day.Estimated>Eyes was the Summer theme ever since Englishtown. Once again we were not disappointed.This recording is once again an upgrade of previous cassettes, I do like how there is no interruptions, taper dude just let it roll. The Band was set up on the field and you felt closer than usual to them.Someone mentioned how Jerry appeared to be not into it, I never judged a book by it's cover, the Dead were famous for looking one way yet blowing your doors off (10-12-84), I came for the soundz and vibes, that is what the Dead were about. No costumes or gimmicks, just gettin' the music to the massess.  We all came down in a Friendly Ice Cream Palor which was a trip for locals to watch a bunch of grinning hippies devouring Ice Cream!",

      "review_text": "THIS WAS MY FIRST SHOW!!! This was my first Grateful Dead show when I \"thought\" I knew their music and \"who\" the THE GRATEFUL DEAD really were! (I must have been joking myself!) Oh My Buddha! I was so young and dumb as I clearly remember getting my head ripped off by Mr. Jerry Garcia's absolutely supernatural guitar and the entire band's overwhelming (and I mean ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMING!!!!!) performance all the way throughout the concert!!!! I was still only a teenager in high school and I had listened to many GD albums and live tapes faithfully and knew all the songs, but what I didn't know is what they would do to me when they were first \"brought to life\" in front of my eyes and ears! Indeed, my life was changed forever and I'll never forget this day. Never. \n\nAnd yes, I too remember when the guy jumped to his death from the top of the stadium inside one of the gigantic cement circular stairways. And, yes, indeed, that was a very big bummer when I found out about it the next day in the newspaper. And I remember when it happened during the second set as many security guys in yellow shirts and windbreakers started running up TOWARDS OUR SECTION!!! And I was really scared as I thought WE were going to get massively busted for smoking or something, but they kept running past and I found out the tragic news in the paper the next day.\n\nBut that did not diminish the absolutely amazing experience and life transformation that I went through upon seeing THE GRATEFUL DEAD for the very first time in my life. And I went on to see many truly amazing and landmark Grateful Dead shows after this for years, but of all the Grateful Dead shows that I saw, this one short show, by far, had the biggest impact on me. \n\nAnd, IMHO, highlights include a very cool and very slow \"Friend of The Devil\" and an AWESOME \"Peggy-O\" in the first set. Later on the Good Lovin'-Scarlet-Fire and The Prophet-Eyes were totally magnificent performances that just burned down the stadium. And, despite all that happened and all that we went through to get there and back: FIVE STARS!!! It was really a very special experience for me - it was a clear turning point in my life in so many ways. And I thank the Internet Archive very much that I could finally find this show.",

A huge stadium, and our seats were awful, at the oposite end of the football stadium from the stage. \"To hell with this,\" we said. It proved impossible to get onto the field, so we found ourselves in the deck right behind the stage, looking down at the back of Donna's 4-foot-long train of hair. We had a much better time here than our original seats.\n\nMost people here give their first shows a 5-star rating, but having listened to over a hundred shows here at Archive.org, this rates a 4, regardless of my fond memories. Though enjoyable, it's not a remarkable show in any way.\n\nHighlights include the jam in the middle of Lazy Lightning/Suplication and the jam between Scarlet and Fire. These are ensemble efforts.",

This show rocks!!\n\nOkay, now that weve established that freaks were walking around in the parking lot searching for shoes, and lunatics were jumping off the top of Giants Stadium, has anyone actually taken the time to review this amazing show??  Believe methis one will take your breath away!  Aside from DP #18 (which is really a combination of 2 shows from 2/3/78 and 2/5/78 in Wisconsin and Iowa), this is the best show Ive heard so far from 1978.  One could make a case that this show is certainly as good as some of the Winterland shows in October.  And yes, its even better than the Red Rocks shows in July and August of 78.\n\nThe vocals in this show are absolutely incredible, not to mention Jerrys mind-blowing guitar playing, which may be some of the best Ive ever heard.  Even Keiths keyboards are totally in sync with Jerrys blazing guitar (just listen to Lazy Lightning > Supplication)!  The Scarlet > Fire just may be as good as Barton Hall, 5-8-77, although Ive yet to hear a better ending to the Fire from 5-8-77 (nothing compares to Garcias out-worldly guitar in that one).  And then going straight into Estimated Prophet > Eyes is ridiculous!  Scarlet > Fire > Prophet > Eyes is what dreams are made of!  Garcias guitar just doesnt let up, people!!\n\nThe 1st set is mind-blowing!  Jack Straw, Friend of the Devil, New Minglewood Blues, Dire Wolf, and Looks Like Rain are nothing short of spectacular!  And lets not forget about Peggy-O.  Looks Like Rain is right up there with 2/3/78 (Madison, WI), which may be the best one of all time, IMHO!  Good Lovin is unique because Bobby jams in the middle of that song like Ive never heard him jam before.  Check out Good Lovin from 11/1/79, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY (top 3 of all time)!  11/1/79 is definitely my overall favorite Good Lovin to date!  Bobby and Brent are off-the-hook in that one, as is Jerry!\n\nAnyway, I consider 9/2/78 a diamond in the rough (Night Full of Diamonds? -- LOL), because 78 is known for some awesome shows in the beginning of the year, and towards the latter part of the year.  Download this show now!  You wont regret it!  Oh yeah, this may be the best Estimated Prophet > Eyes combo Ive heard to date!  The Eyes is as good, if not better, than the one on Without A Net from 3-29-90 (Nassau Coliseum)  just absolutely sic!  Garcia and Weir were on another planet this night.  And this isnt a short show.  1st set is almost 70 minutes, and the 2nd set is over 90 minutes.\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",

Nosebleed seats, but a buddy had great binoculars that he'd forgotten about until well into the trip. Made the zoom even better. Had to keep rotating seats with the 3 friends I was with because the unknown tripper next to us was so far out it was distracting and sometimes a little scary...\nMy 2 strongest feelings about this show overall:\n1) The whole band was incredibly tight...to the point where Jerry, Donna and Bobby would move to the microphones in perfect synch. Some of the best vocals I ever heard live. \n2) From our nosebleed seats, the intermission looked as if the entire stadium was tipped away from the stage, pouring the DeadHeads out the tunnel, then tipped the other way as the band began to play again, to the point of spilling over the wall into the field...what a trip!\n\nThere are so many shows and so much evolution that I cannot see how anyone can rate the absolute best ever, or even the best of a particular year, or the best year. There are some bad ones, but that is part of the point of the Grateful Dead experimentation...sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and it's different for everyone.\n\nA very fond and everlasting memory, the best because it was the first.",

I remember mistaking Ramrod for Jer and the length of Donna's hair.  I remember a Terrapin mirror in the upper decks that looked out of season, if you know what I mean.\n\nI also remember, even though these large venue shows had become a sort of end of summer tradition by then (Watkins Glen, Englishtown, etc.) how the music seems to get lost in the expanse of the stadium.  This was the first concert ever played there, as I recall, and it was a madhouse.  Crazy traffic outside the stadium and some poor soul even died when he fell from the upper levels.\n\nAnd this was just before the ill-fated trip to Egypt which was designed in our minds to recreate the Europe '72 run and provide a special setting and the shows, by the band's admission, were mediocre at best.  \n\nThey came back and played a stellar series of shows at Winterland later that year.  But within six months, Keith and Donna were gone.  Within less than three years, Jer was deep into his bad habits and the band chemistry, according to Phil, was suffering.  Within a few more years, the band is intervening with Jer and he's getting busted in GG Park and ultimately suffering from a diabetic coma.\n\nYou can say what you want about the music, but I think this show represents a critical juncture in the band's history and one where it finally began to shed its heritage of a house band that was about the music to a band that was careening toward a loss of control of its own destiny.",

In hindsite other then the opener and Lazy Lightning>Supplication the first set wasn't great but at the time I enjoyed it allot which is all that matters. The second set though was totally intense. And those words dont even begin to relate what was happening down on the field.  I was about 20 yards from the stage slight off center stage left. The PA was amazing, incredible power and clarity. NRPS was very cool and Willie was great.  A couple of comments though and maybe I read too fast or missed something but...  One reviewer mentions a second encore of Shakedown, didn't happen 9/2/78, also a few comments mention Good Lovin' into Eyes of the World, also didn't happen. I went on to see the dead about 60 times, saw some killer shows, but this second set on that hot Saturday is a very special standout. The first time... Incredible.",

      "review_text": "This my first show/age 13 This was my first ever GD show. My brother's girlfriend and her friends took me. I had no idea what to expect. It was hot as hell on the field of Giants' Stadium, so I bought a GD \"visor.\" LOL! Maybe it embarrassed the girls I was with, but I kinda needed it. \nI have to admit I was more \"wowed\" by the NRPS and Willie Nelson that day because it wasn't until about 5 years later when I really GOT and UNDERSTOOD the Dead. After that there was no turning back. However! I was familiar with Shakedown and the Dead's other \"pop\" songs. We were smoking tons of grass and the day was a milestone for me. I totally \"got\" the way people were cool and relaxed. But, it didn't sink-in, like I said, until my 18th year. I just bought the collection of GD shows at Giants Stadium and although I was probably at most of them, I wish they had included this show. ",

      "review_text": "Bobby Tuning I appreciate the fact that this is a first show for many NYC/Jersey area heads. The photographs of the show are amazing as the people are so loosely interspersed in that gargantuan space. I'm pretty sure I saw the Cosmos at Giants in '77 or '78. I was totally into Pel\u00e9 at the time!\n\nI've been listening today only out of curiosity. The setlist never grabbed me, and I couldn't comprehend how the Dead's '78 sound (best suited for a theater, little college B-Ball arena, or Winterland) could fill this cavernous hole. However, the Scarlet-> Fire is turning my head around. Very nice transition between the songs.\n\nOne curiosity, though, is the way Bobby spends the first instrumental break tuning his guitar. This was a perennial problem in the heat, and by all accounts, here, it was hot that day. What at first seems to be some horrible Bobby morphs into him tuning his guitar WHILE Jerry is jamming prior to the \"Wind the willow's\" return. Say what you will about Bobby, but that's pretty slick.\n\nEither guitar technology changed, or bands have gotten better at cooling stages, but this was a frequent problem with the Dead. Whether it was under the hot spotlights of the Fillmore or as \"the Sunstroke Serenaders\" in Oregon, tuning was a frequent phenom. Still, I don't recall another show where I've heard Bobby retune during a Scarlet Jam!\n\nFour stars for a groovy second set. For my 2\u00a2, the best Scarlet Fire of '78 is the Horton Field House. Giants stadium ain't no slouch, though, and it's definitely laid waaaay back.\n\nGreat matrix version also available:\n\ngd1978-09-02.131868.mtx.dusborne.flac16\n\nWorth a gander.\n\n",
