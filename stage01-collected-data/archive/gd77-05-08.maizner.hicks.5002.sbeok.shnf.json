      "review_text": "Some Perspective on the Show In my fairly substantial experience listening to bootlegs and going to Grateful Dead concerts (65 shows before Jerry kicked it, from '81 - '94), I've found that when Phil (the bassist, for you non-Heads out there) is playing well, the band plays well, and conversely.  At Barton Hall, Phil was playing very, very well.  This is perhaps nowhere more evident than on the \"Scarlet Begonias --> Fire on the Mountain\" track, which is in my opinion 25 minutes of pure orgasmic paradise.  Sure, they tear it up on Jack Straw, Deal and Brown Eyed Women, but listen to Phil's licks during the opening jam of Scarlet Begonias and you'll see what I mean.  The dude is just ripping it and sliding it up and down the frets.  I also happen to like the opening of these earlier \"Scarlets\" better than the way the song later evolved -- here, Keith (keyboardist) plays the opeing riff, while Jerry and Bob sort of follow his lead.  In later years, Jerry would usually start Scarlet with a guitar riff, and the keyboards were secondary.  In fact, I have no problem saying that the 25 minutes of Scarlet/Fire played at this show is the single best rock performance anywhere, anytime, by anyone.  Take a listen if you don't believe me.  The jam between the end of Scarlet and the beginnig of Fire is musically and technically one of their best transitions as well.  How they get from Scarlet to Fire is absolutely mesmerizing, and when you hear Jerry pluck the first few chords of the Fire intro, you get chills (or at least this old Deadhead does).  It's also a heaping slice of a bygone era, and one best listened to with your eyes closed, the music turned up VERY loud, and picturing yourself at Barton Hall, dancing, all those years ago.  While what constitutes the \"best show of all time\" depends on the song selection, the venue, the audience vibe, and the quality of the boys' playing (among other things), this show certainly was top notch in most of those categories.  If you've never really listened to the Dead and have always wondered what all the hype was about, then this show, muscially speaking, is the show that will convert you.  Why?  Well, I usually divide up Dead tunes into \"Beginner's\", \"Intermediate\", \"Advanced\", and \"For Serious Deadheads Only\", and this show consists mostly of tunes I'd put in the \"Beginner's\" and \"Intermediate\" categories.  The boys' playing that night was also very tight (as opposed to some of the looser, more free-flowing concerts that novices tend not to like and which takes some getting used to), and the quality of the sound cannot be beat.  It is therefore very accessible to those who are uninitiated.   I always tell people that if you've never seen a Grateful Dead concert, you've never really seen a rock concert.  By listening to this show, you'll at least get closer to knowing what it was all about, and why this band is so passionately loved by those in the know.  Remember:  turn Scarlet Begonias up LOUD.",

Sure 4/23/77 is perhaps the first truly great one, Jerry is so slick and innovative. But the 5/8 is magic...energy is so BIG, almost stadium rock in the Barton barn. Phil up front, rock star, leading the way early on, the SF transition is so intricate, Jer dancing on the fretboard with such fluidity and grace, light raindrops on your spine, building in intensity, then progressively tumbling through time and space, falling apart in delay and envelope distortion...leading to Mickey's carribbean beats as the transition progresses into Fire, a harbinger of Scarlet Fires to come. \n\nBest ever show? I dunno, what is this, the NFL? This show is undeniably fun, from the big Minglewood, to the funkified, all-out Danicin' that is sure to put a smile on your face, or make you jump up and start doing the robot dance, Dead-style. To the Dew, sweet, sweet finale. \n\nIt is uniquely positioned as perhaps the one show that we as a family have in common, along with maybe 8/27/72, from the newby who just jumped on the bus in 2005 to those of us who wore out our XL II's of it decades ago. It's place in GD lore was cast long ago, but it is so great to relive the debate through archive online, something I only imagined in my wildest dreams in the years after 1995. \n\nAll the best.

I downloaded the lossless version as it did not exist on the other upload.However, before anyone does the same, go to the other upload and download each song seperately as they were remastered by Rob Eaton as shorten files.While it is a pain, the quality difference is unbelievable!Again, nothing personal. But a show this good deserves the best quality available. Now, best show ever, out of 2700+ shows-Europe,Pigpen, the pyramids-how can you choose one.However, disc 2 is 70 minutes of some of the finest dead you'll ever hear. I read all the hype first and got a chance to listen to disc 2&3 this past Sunday. Sunny, 70 degrees, jumped in the car as to not be disturbed and so I could turn it up as far as Mr. Bose allows, cracked a cold Fosters oil can and drove 70 miles around the outerbelt in St. Louis grinning my ass off.Dancin-15 minutes of funkafied glory, SF-opening notes my the hairs on my arms and legs stand on end and the base line-pure Philness. Foster-$2.50, cd and case- $1.00, disc 2 from 5/8/77-PRICELESS. You will want to check out the remaster from the night before as well from Boston(my first show!)Very good as well.

      "review_text": "One of the truly special shows On the anniversary of one of the all-timers, this show is held so dear by so many deadheads that it is one of the true links for newbie to old-timer (as someone notes below).  It has almost invariably been one of the first tapes of a show that we first had our minds blown by and one of the first tapes that we literally wore out...most of us know the Betty Board with the Minglewood fade in and the chunk missing (Ouch!) from Lazy Lightning>Supplication which otherwise is of great quality.  My highest recommendation is to listen regularly to the Rob Eaton Betty Board with the Audience splice for those two glitches, but there is something very special about an excellent audience tape (CD). Obnoxious fan comments and offbeat clapping are generally made up for by the ambiance and crowd response, making one feel even more a part of the original experience.  This is an excellent audience with a minimum of negative audience intrusion.\n     As for the show itself, there is little that can be added to the many previous reviews, except, perhaps, to note the sometimes unheralded gems of the first set.  Everyone knows how otherworldly the second set is and of course the Dancin' from set one is held as perhaps the finest version around.  But depsite a somewhat disappointing Minglewood, almost every version of songs from set one could be thought of as \"best\" versions.  In particular my favorites are Loser, TLEO, Jack Straw (for its fluidity and perfect groove, how often do you think of this song for its groove?!), BE Women (again for the ease and fluidity of Jerry's playing and the rest of the band not getting in the way), Row Jimmy (some of Jer's best slide work ever!), and Dancin' (finding the non-stop, eternal groove). \n     The second set has the bonus of \"everybody's favorite fun game Take-A-Step-Back\". And beside the mundane Estimated, the set is perfectly, ineffibly transcendant.  This show can certainly hold its own against the great shows that are on the tip of the tongue for so many deadheads.  2/13/70, 8/27/72 and 5/8/77 may be the most talked about shows of all time.  And that is not to say that they are the \"best\" shows per se, because grading is always going to be subjective, but they definitely have whatever qualities it takes to be mentioned with the best!  And IMO it is just fun to listen and then attempt to explain what it is that made the experience so miraculous...enjoy!",

(it was a warm may upstate evening going in) and getting marooned overnight in the car with friends  after driving off the side of the country road, waiting for the morning sun to show us the way back to buffalo, where i was then going to school.\n\nplaying with the idea of seeing dso in ithaca for the 30th anniversary, but in some ways the pure experience lives most clearly in my mind and whenever i play it on cd or ipod walking in central park or driving in the car.",

The first set would have been fantastic if it were not for these long tunings between songs. \u201cTLEO\u201d, \u201cJack Straw\u201d, \u201cDeal\u201d, \u201cMama Tried\u201d and especially \u201cBrown-Eyed Women\u201d are great. This \u201cBEW\u201d differs a lot form those, played in 73-74, and I like its jazzy, mellow sound. Also I like the way Jerry sang the third line of the chorus.\n\n\u201cLazy Lightning>Supplication\u201d was much better in 1976. I would like to abstain from commenting \u201cS>F\u201d, because I can\u2019t say, whether it\u2019s the best version ever or not (I like 1993/9/13 version more or \u201cClosing Winterland\u201d version). It has some special moments, and great transition though.\n\nThe latter part of the second set is incredible. \u201cStephen>NFA>Stephen\u201d. Never heard better intro, and development of the melody before the first verse is wonderful. Transition to NFA is quite a surprise and jamming in the middle before returning to the main theme and then \u201cStephen\u201d is beyond description! But I can\u2019t understand one thing: what these two songs have in common to be united? And the show\u2019s peak \u2013 \u201cMorning Dew\u201d.  There were so many great \u201cDews\u201d that it\u2019s almost impossible to determine the best one. However, I shall say that Cornell\u2019s version is very special",

I love Keith and his piano with the band... This is also about the time Donna's singing started going downhill but she is alright in this show. (it's interesting to note that Jerry much preferred to play along with an organ sound as it gave him more \"sonic space to create his magic, but I have to say the piano riffs sound so much better to me!)I remember standing to side of stage not more than 10 feet away from Keith - can you believe this was general admission? I never thought Brent and Vince contributed as much to the sound. Jerry's voice is still quite strong in this era, and for me the later years 80's and 90's were hit or miss vocally. The opening intro to St Stephen is beautiful - it never seemed the same when the Dead jammed into St. Stephen. The weather was amazing that night; I remember the afternoon of the show it was around 60 degrees and sunny. By the start of the show it was 40 degrees and sarting to rain. By the end of the show it was snowing! I will never forget all the deadheads in t-shirts, shorts and sandals huddled everywhere around Cornell trying to stay warm. I think a lot of kids just showed up with shorts and t-shirts and didn't think about the weather. The next day I returned to 14 inches of snow in Ct! When I meet younger deadheads these days they all are amazed to talk to someone who was there. And yes, Jerry did actually say something during the show! At the time it wasn't audible but it seems like he said \"thanks Mom? \"One of the few rare times I remember Jerry speaking at a show - a sure sign he was enjoying himself. I remeber wondering about the song Fire and no one knew anything anbout the song - we had to wait a year for the record to come out.",

On playback with a Dolby B unit with a decent 32-bit DSP all four recordings \"blossom\" very satisfactorily.\n\nAll four recordings are, however, Grade AAA, 5-star, despite slight flaws and one small error in two of them.\n\nI have the \"Moore-Cribbs\" version on my personal iPod because I like the extra guitar and piano presence on that recording; but usually play the \"Shure57-Stevenson\" version on my stereo (but you could hurt yourself with this version using ear buds IMHO).\n\nOne last note, the \"Shure57-Stevenson\" recording is the best *ever* of Jerry's guitar, bar none, and every fan will want this recording in their collection!\n\nThese four recordings are definitely among the best of all time.

This show transported anyone who was there to a much higher place that we still haven't come down from. fortunately for those who weren't there this tape ( and the other copies) all do the same. Close your eyes, put this on and you will liftoff! I did a number of shows on the spring tour of 1977 and everything about this-my friends in Ithaca, the waterfalls, the thai stick and acid,Cornell University, Barton Hall in its Gothic splendor, the snowfall after walking out of the show-was just incredible. there was no need to speak afterward, we all knew we had just experienced one of the high points of our lives.

I got on the bus back in 2003 and it has been growing into an insane trip with each passing year.\n\nWhen I downloaded this show from WinMX (remember?) I did not know of this shows status of being one of the best, I just wanted more Dead. I remember having this show across three cds. The famous Betty Board with the missing intro. I remember walking home and always having the second cd in my 'discman' The second cd was from Mama Tried all the way till the end of the Scarlet-Fire. I loved Mama Tried but would usually skip through Row Jimmy because I could not wait for the Dancing In The Sreets. Loved Bob's 'Take A Step Back' it always made me smile. Walking home from school with the sun in my face, care-free 16-17 year old and listening to this music....I felt so honoured. It must be a gift from God.\n\nI would joke around sometimes and speak \"deadhead\" language to some other kids at school. They have never even heard of the band before. Imagine their faces when I would press pause at lunch time and tell them the band was playing Scarlett into Fire! hahahaha. I did not bother trying to get people on the bus. I was having a difficult time getting people to like the catchy songs of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, WHO etc I kept the Grateful Dead all to myself.\n\nNow I sit here listening to this show....on my iPod, almost midnight, 2010. I am always taken back to those special care-free days of my last two years of highschool, which I loved. Although I was not at this show, Atleast I have a special place this show takes me to. I am sure everyone here has one.\n\nI would like to hear stories from the rest of you. We all know the music is great. Almost pointless for a review.",

Weir's funky rythm was so enjoyable to listen to, and phil lesh was in tip top form that night. Goes without saying that phil's playing this night was more amazing that usual.Mickey and bill are whoopin ass with killer fills and dead on timing in every song.\n\nObviously a great show. as of now it is my favorite dead show. i do believe this is their best show, at lease the best show i've heard so far.",

I can argue for all kinds of viewpoints regarding the Dead, but of this I am sure:  lots of people got very turned on to the band in upstate NY in 1977.  By then the Dead needed no help regarding their ability to blow minds, but really, if you want to understand how the scene got SO big in the 80s, I think it was the true personal impact for many and subsequent reputation among thousands of shows like this.  Just astounding visions and words come to life (magic?), BIG dynamics, a living thing right there in your head, on the tape, in the air for years, all of our lives.  Special.",

I have to say, at the time, while it was obviously a great show and a wonderful experience, it didn't seem vastly better than the other outstanding shows of 1977 (like the Palladium show I saw a week earlier, or Englishtown a few months later)... Of course, a few years later I wore out a reel-to-reel tape listening to this show!\n\nThis was also the only general-admission show where I actually worked my way right up to the front and managed to take some pictures. I shot the best one during the slow vocals on St. Stephen... Since this show seems to be very under-documented visually, I thought I'd put up the link for everybody's enjoyment:\n\nhttp://i5.nyu.edu/~mm64/goldfarb/GD5877.JPG\n\nIt's too bad that my college roommate's head takes up so much room between Bobby and Donna, but hey, it's still a great shot! Dig it!\n\n(Technical info: Shot on 35mm Tri-X with a Petri Color 35, exposed at 1/15th at f/2.8, and developed in D-76. I just made a new 8x10 print from the negative about four years ago and scanned it, probably at 200dpi, and made minor adjustments for contrast/brightness and retouched out some dust. \n\nAside regarding archival original media: I seriously doubt that anybody will be able to read anything off of a digi-cam memory card after 30+ years, whereas this negative was in perfect usable condition! I've got nothing against digital imaging, but old-school film photography is still MAGIC!)",

But I've moved twice since and may have lost half of it in a divorce. So I tried downloading this show recently and find the recordings not nearly as full as before.  I do remember that the original download was a mix of the soundboard with some audience recording mixed in. But I can't seem to find mixes like that now? I can only seem to find audience recordings to download and soundboard files to stream, whereas previously I could download them also?\n\n\nFunny thing also, I went to Cornell at the time and saw this show. First Dead show ever! I was way impressed with how the dead managed to make Barton Hall, which had notoriously bad sound (big volume, lots of echo), actually sound okay. They did this by hoisting the speakers up halfway up to the ceiling, so they were projecting down the middle. It made it sound great most everywhere. Very clever I thought, since I hadn't seen any other band do this in Barton Hall.\n\nAnyways, any help in finding soundboard recordings or mixes of them would be great!\n\n-Gary",

For that freshman year, I was on the lighting committee and I ran the SuperTrooper (cutting edge spotlight...for that day and age) on top of the ROTC Building.  I think I was \"Trooper no. 1\". I really can't remember the number -- but I do remember that my responsibility for most of the night was to keep my spot on Jerry.  And I also remember being absolutely mesmerized since this was my first Dead show.  Operating on top of the ROTC Building in a cloud of smoke was, well, challenging at times, but during that second set, when the band went into Morning Dew...I had never ever heard anything like that. I can't say I was the best spotlight operator that night, but that was the most incredible concert experience -- still, to this day -- that I ever had.
