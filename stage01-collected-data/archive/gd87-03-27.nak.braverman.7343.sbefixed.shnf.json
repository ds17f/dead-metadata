Set 2 is where it's at - starting with the best Touch of Grey, with the biggest audience response, I ever heard in person.  Garcia's fist in the air fired everybody up and made it clear he was really back from coma-land.  Cumberland was a nice surprise before the jamming began in earnest.

Bobby does his part too, with standout versions of G.S., Rooster(with a little help fom Brent), BIODTL(How are old are you Trigger?), and a killer MNS. \nBest TOUCH ever. Not a fist, but the mighty PAW OF POWER was raised a few times during this monumental version. The Cumberland is also smokin.\nEstimated>Eyes is also quite good, one of the last, fast Eyes. Space> Crazy Fingers tease> UJB>AM DEW E: JBG, is phenomenal every version a standout with the DEW being a version to build on for years to come. I still remember the look on head's faces, stumbling out of the civic center that night, BLOWN AWAY! Tough ticket to get, a 1987 show that can hold its own against many other years great shows. Better show than the first, mosly due to the 2nd set, But the Midnight Hour>Cold Rain and the Row Jimmy & Birdsong from the 26th are all killer versions.",

But with every searing Garcia solo (\"Morning Dew\") there's a selction that never memorably comes alive...(\"UJB\"-nostalgically pleasing but hardly memorable and 'Eyes' whose intro is nonexistant) \n\"Johnny\" is a hot capper to the evening. Other hilites include a hot segue in between \"Touch\" and \"Samson,\" a bouncy and lively \"BIODTL,\" crowd unity during \"Rooster\" and the highly danceable \"TMNS.\"  Still it's 1987, and there's little oddness to be found as they're beginning to celebrate their greatest inroad to mainstream success.",

Other than that my 16 years of life in CT pretty much sucked!!!!  First set of 3/26/87 and second set of 3/27/87 would have made for an epic show.  Likewise first set 10/15/83 and second set 10/14/83.  This night was great all around- -especially the UJB >> Dew with JBGOODE encore.  There are times I think I should have called it a touring career after the summer '87 tour with Dylan.  Then I stop being a tripping bumbling idiot and conclude that 13 years of chronic fun and smiles wouldn't have gotten me through the trauma of Dubya years!!!",

These shows, this tour, this year 1987 was just packed with energy!\nThese AUD tapes are so fun to crank up on a big speaker system, they thunder and the crowd is enthusastic as hell.\n2nd set opener this night with Touch of Grey is poigniant. I will Survive meant something more than just words after Jerry came back from his coma, and you can hear it in this tape. We Will Survive was equally as tremendous, It was evident that the celebration of Jerry's return was full on, even though he'd made it back to the stage in Oct of 86 w/JGB.  I have listened to most of this east coast spring tour and have downloaded most if it and the past week have been listening to nothing but this tour, it's getting me through winter and this is really exciting Dead!!

      "review_text": "Sickest Touch of Grey You'll Ever Hear F#$%ing ridiculous!  Phil laying it down fast and heavy.  This is my favorite Dead anthem for a reason.  I know it may sound cliche but back in 1987 MTV (yes it used to play videos) was king and the skeleton marionettes video hooked me.  I still remember hearing it again, but for the first time on regular old FM radio.  I still drive that road from time to time and it brings back a lot of memories from when I was 12. Anyone remember cassette tapes?  Well my In the Dark tape is sitting on my nightstand as we speak.  Glad I still have it as the studio version of \"My Brother Esau\" was only released on this medium. Anyway I'm giving this 5 stars based on the Touch alone.  I'm sure the rest of the show will not disappoint and I'm excited to hear it in its entirety.  Enjoy!  \"I will get by, I will survive.\"",

I attended the show, and remeber the crowd being pretty raucous (especially Touch of Grey).  The show really takes off at Music Never Stopped, and each song in the second set is well done.  Morning Dew is ripping and emotive at the same time.  Great jam in estimated as well.",

BEST EVER ! not even funny how crazy and insane this is,just beyond what exists,thats all i can say.    and then and again, more insane stomping with excellent sound and energy in Sampson with just a bunch a sick Jerry guitar lines and solos  and golly i love to crank this one up right into a sick Cumberland with awesome energy,and Jerry turning backwards on himself on purpose in the solo and just ripping the thing.so leading into a FAT Estimated with the sound and vibe just beyond what was real.and the Eyes was just still stomping! and there is no letting up.into a fat drums,full of intensity and a short but poignant and serious space brought into an out of the blue perfect Uncle John's Band,with the band still on fire!when the first notes of Morning Dew fell,it was stunning ! all over ! the place just fell apart and together,and the roof just broke off ! that's all.  the fiery and serious Johnny B. Good encore had the same energy and punch as the Alabama,and i walked out into the world thinking wow,what the hell just happened",

      "review_text": "Happy 33rd Anniversary! I was in CA by this time but cut my teeth all over the east coast in the early 1980s - and Hartford rarely disappointed, despite the crappy building and worse security.  THANK YOU to everyone for calling out this high-energy show!  You\u2019re right about the Touch - Jerry is bursting and I can completely visualize the fist in the air - the crowd going bonkers - literally sent chills up my spine!  Settling in to Cumberland now (one of my favorites) and excited about what\u2019s to come.  Forever grateful....",

      "review_text": "Wow!  I had gotten on the Spring tour the night previous, which was an enjoyable concert. The 2nd night (this night), the first set seemed okay (liked the song selection), but didn\u2019t seemed to have enough oomph until Tennessee Jed. I was so sick of Touch of Gray by this point, but this Touch of Gray was different. It became all the song could be, IMHO. Many others here seem to agree. I\u2019ve heard many over the years, but this version is Best!!  ",
