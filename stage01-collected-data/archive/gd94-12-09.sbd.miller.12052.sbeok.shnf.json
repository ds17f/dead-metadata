      "review_text": "Holds up pretty well I'm listening to this show 10 years to the day after it happened (12/09/2004) and parts of this show sounds better on disc than it did at the show. I seem to recall the mix being really poor inside the Coliseum.  Anyway the show starts off well with a really nice Stranger.  The rest of the first set is fine, although I think Jerry forgets how Ramble On Rose goes, so he ends up playing the instrumental bridge forever before he regroups and finishes the song.  The confusion isn't that noticable except for the length of the song. The Music closes the set nicely, and it is a relief to have a 1994 first set that clocks in at over an hour instead of the 50 minutes sets that were becoming all to common by then. \n\nDespite the presence of only one post-drums/space song, this second set is LONG.  The Scarlet is fine, notable for a long Garcia solo in the middle.  Fire on the Mountain is where the sparks fly, with the presence of a guest drummer.  The version is percussion intensive, and at one point the band lets the drummers almost take over the song, playing backup to an almost drum solo.  It sounds good LOUD.  It was really nice of Jerry to follow the Truckin with a That Would Be Something, and THEN a He's Gone before going into a very long Drums/Space segment.",

      "review_text": "runaway train I saw this show after Denver and the night before, perhaps the least consequential shows I had ever seen. I wasn't expecting much. They had been more miss than hit since 91 or so anyway. \n\nJerry forgets lyrics on nearly every tune he sings this night. But his tone, his sound, it was so rich and fat. He turned his energy towards the jams, and it was an amazing, wild ride. Fire on the Mountain was one of my favorite Dead memories ever. Three drummers, amazing sound, Jerry like a steamroller just rocking without stop. I remember after one of the long jams, seeing him step to the mike and singing a lyric and realizing that this really was happening. They really took it out there. What a great time.",

      "review_text": "My Only Experience on the West Coast It was at this show where a certain gentleman, whom I won't name, smuggled a La Croix bottle into the show.  Needless to say, it wasn't La Croix in the bottle.  My friends and I were out here to hang with him and his friends.  We drove all the way from Tennessee.  Anyway, we were all situated in the upper level, having a wonderful time.  I heard various rumors about what was in that bottle, but he passed that one bottle around to the point where everybody in the entire section managed to get a swig.  Not thirty minutes later, folks were tapping us on our shoulders wondering if there was more to share and what was in that bottle??  We just smiled and kept on dancing, saying nothing but \"enjoy the show\".  By the time second set came around we were roaring!!  The whole section of the arena was high as holy heaven.  We all were freakin'.  So much that after the show, we thought some of our new friends were cops.  That's how high we were.  We were convinced we were in trouble and we hadn't even done anything illegal...what's illegal about taking a swig of juice??  Nothing.  I've never felt so great in my life.  I remember the Scarlet_Fire lasting what seemed like eternity.  This night was the high point, literally, of the four night stand.  What a laid back time.  West coast shows were a completely different ball game than East coast shows, which were always rowdy and crazed!!",

      "review_text": "there was a room in oakland-alameda stadium, next to the Rock Med area, adjacent to a large walkway down, just off the floor.  Someone was thoughtful enough to equip the room with two speakers amd a scene was born!  This was the night that I truly discovered the magic of dancing with other people. We had a little secret room all to ourselves, for a whole show...a whole run of shows in fact, but this night, with a 6 song pre drums was the one to remember.",

      "review_text": "It wasn't Jerry's Falt During the STRANGER I am reminded of how little Vince brought to the stage, talent-wise.  His repetitive nature of his soloing was getting old at this point.  And his back-up vocals are so loud, almost yelling, and obtrusive.  He jumps in during Jerry's solos like he has something to say, musically...but unfortunately only ends up disrupting flow and killing the jam, only to repeat his go nowhere solo that he does during most Strangers, Shakedowns, Slipknot!s, and who could forget the Samba jam he did so frequently. I'll say it again, I would have used heroin to cope with the direction of the music vince and weir were taking...post Brent.  The whole scene was selling out and the contributions of weir and welnick made sure of that.\n5 stars for everyone but vince.  Jerry rules",

      "review_text": "agree with many on this 1994 was so far past their peak, for those who could see them early and often, this was very apparent.  they try here and there to build to a peak, but the sound is not cohesive, the playing is sporadic at best and their voices are aging.  I am a HUGE fan, but rarely listen to shows post 1984/5 as some of it makes me cringe.  Enjoy the new incarnation, FURTHUR this new years, they are stretching it out more than the Dead did in their later years. And as we age, we can appreciate them reinventing themselves after Jerry passed.  Happy Dancing to All!",

They gave me a 30 minute version that dominated the 2nd set.  Now I'm not going to say that this was an amazing show, but for a 14 year old kid it was pretty special.  So grateful i was able to catch the 3 shows i did.",

      "review_text": "First show with teleprompter (maybe two and a half) Jerry wasn't doing well during this time and this run of shows is a prime example and I saw all four so it isn't a matter of \"you had to be there\" although I don't want to take away from others' enjoyment. There are certainly very good bits mixed in during the run. There's a reason that John Cutler started turning Jerry down while bringing Bob and Vince up in the mix as well as having to bring in a teleprompter. Let's face it, during this era the rest of the band spent a lot of time covering for Jerry with Vince trying to fill in as good as he could.",

      "review_text": "Really good show I remember this show because it was my son's first birthday and we took him to the show to celebrate. He's one of the few 23 year olds today who can say he saw Jerry. We spent most of our time in the halls dancing and chasing him around. I took him inside once and really liked the lights. I usually don't listen to shows that happened after Brent died, but I came across this and though I'd give a listen for nostalgia sake. Very pleasantly surprised. The band is tight and on it. I don't notice Jerry's lyric slips so much and the jamming is excellent. Now I'm going to go listen to the 11th, which was my last show before Jerry died.",

When people nit pick these shows it seems so odd. These runs were so fabulous, I guess you had to be there in context in Oakland to understand. Halls filled with spinners, echoes in the upper dome, dancing on the floor. These shows were so enjoyable it was like living on another planet in comparison to today's 300 dollar ticket for crap. (the scam bands) Gratitude for these amazing tours and thanks to all of the band members for keeping the Grateful Dead alive as long as you did. Thanks to archive for this amazing collection! \"Cat on a tin roof, Dogs in the pound, Nothing left to do but smile smile smile!!!",
