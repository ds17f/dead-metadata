Great stereo seperation, strong vocals, lots of details (symbols, keys, Bobbby's guitar) and a bouncy Phil. Jerry's guitar is lower than some might like (it actually gets PLENTY loud), but it presents a more holistic view of the band. Eyes encore is the cherry on top. This show is a 5, those who think there's far too many 5's given out to 1974 miss the point that this is one of the golden eras of the band from both playing and recording perspectives.",

      "review_text": "Rockin Pairs 7/27/74: Roanoke Virginia, 1974. The cool thing about the grateful dead is that they played everywhere, in big and small venues and big and small cities around the US and abroad. The small city of Roanoke, VA nestled in the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains provided a beautiful scene for a Saturday night show. This area of Virginia has always been more laid back and mellower than its counterpart of Richmond. Where Richmond had tobacco and big companies like RJ Reynolds, Roanoke had farm boys and small shopkeepers. When the dead showed up to play, they picked up on this mellow vibe and blew into the first set with a cool flavor that would leave the most seasoned tobacco smoker with a buzz.\nThey jump into the first set with an intro which leaves you thinking of a TLEO opener, but quickly you realize bertha has the rightful place in the first spot. This is nicely played, and listening to the soundboard I still can\u2019t believe the high quality boards that are available, and this show has some great sound to start out. Bertha is flawlessly played, and it\u2019s the same as some 77\u2019s, but they give it a little twists that make this version o\u2019 so cool. Mexicali Blues has bobby singing on point, and is a solid version, nothing really to speak of, but the row jimmy is where it\u2019s at. What a slow, killer version that hits the spot. Jerry\u2019s voice is really sweet man, and the band seemingly realizes it has all night to play to this audience, because they just groove to the finish. Jack Straw is good too. By July of 74 coming off the famous Selland Arena show on the 19th, they are still in the hot zone, and while this show does not provide a \u201cmonster\u201d second set, this is a solid show with a lot of pairs like china >rider and us blues > promised later on in the show.\nHalf-Step is a nice sparkly version, and before Franklin\u2019s became the step-brother of Half-Step in the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, in July of 74\u2019 they tried to pair Half-Step > Roses. This combo does not last too long but it works pretty well here. Bobby Mcgee is a good version, with some nice jamming in the middle, a feel- good first set tune. Tennessee Jed is a decent version it starts out slow but it doesn\u2019t drop off the rest of the first set because of some nice play between keith and phil. Jerry catches on and fires this jed out towards the end with some good flavor. PITB settles in with an immediate impact. They light the fire under the belly after the second verse with kieth tapping some nice keys leading bobby into the third verse with a charge. The instrumental starts out like a rocket ship taking off into outer space when kreutz\u2019 drums give a rap-tap-tap, and continues going skyward. They do their own thing for a few minutes then come together for some tight jamming, then go back into their own directions. They let Kreutz get into the mix quite a bit, he takes over for a few minutes. Kreutz is really driving this PITB then keith takes over at about the 8- minute mark. But kreutz really is rocking out on this PITB and really wants to take this in his own direction and really is overshadowing everyone else here. A really cool little instrumental by the boys at the 11 minute mark, then they space it out. They do some crazy 74 stuff until they charge into the final verse and ends around 24 minutes. Good ending to set #1.\nSet #2 opens with a china > rider that does not disappoint! Whatever they smoked during setbreak worked because this is one of the best china > rider\u2019s of the year. China is played just tight as can be and it really jams hard. The band keeps a thick groove while jerry takes the guitar to distant lands, and the cruise ship docks from china to rider in spectacular fashion. Just sickness. Rider picks up where china leaves off with instrumentals firing on all cylinders. Roanoke was in for a shocker second set if this is how is was gonna be. Even MAMU was fantastic, with some sweet taps by keith. Bobby shows some intensity and emotion in singing the verses, which keep the energy level higher than the blue ridge mountains themselves. And we \u201cHIGH TAILED IT\u201d down to Mexico!!! A decent but not spectacular ramble on rose keeps things moving along fast paced, and another typical first set song big river is played very well. Keith is good on the keys, and provides some nice low-note handiworks in the first verse, then switches to some nice high key riffs in the second jam. Us Blues > promised provides a nice little one-two punch that sends roanoke to its knees like a mike tyson combo. It sounds like they are going into us blues once again, but they take it nicely into promised, one excited extended jam! Holy moly! This sounds like a 1990 show with the stuff they are doing. This is absolutely insane stuff. The setlist should say us blues>fucking sick jam>promised land. A solid brokedown follows and a really nice trifecta of Not Fade Away > Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad > Johnny B. Goode finishes the gig. They do some nice experimentation in NFA, and slip into GDTRFB which leaves you melting like butter on hot bread. the JBG winds it up with some nice cool riffs that slowly brings the city of roanoke back to planet earth....there is an 'eyes' encore which is not available, and by listening of this show, i'm sure that topped off this incredible 74 summer show...but we'll never know!!! have a good listen!!",

Every song is great - even the ones I usually don't like: Mexicali, MMU, Me&Bobby Mcgee! \n\nThis show makes a good case for 1974 being the best year of Grateful Dead.\n\nIs this the greatest It Must Have Been the Roses?

Despite numerous highlights (mostly instrumental, though some vocal as well), I thought the show started a bit sloppy and though it certainly picked up, it remained somewhat unrefined compared to many '74-'77 shows I have heard. The band did have lots of energy, but they usually did back then. I think that tighter vocals would put it at a 4 (I wanted to rate it 3.5). Maybe some of it was at a rushed tempo, but I did not hear the fast tape speed previously mentioned. Still, a good listen and I was at the mid-80s Roanoke shows, so I had to check it out!",

And granted, I was not there, and often the live experience did not translate to the tape - which is why I go nuts seeing these \"Deadheads\" wrote show reviews on this site amd they never even saw the band, they go strictly by tapes, which is absurd in any case, but esepcially so with the Grateful Dead.\n\nFor those needing all of 1974 obviously grab this, otehrise I could recommend 10-15 shows from that year before this without even trying very hard.  The Cap Centre shpw 7/29 and Chicago 7/25 are both much better, as is of course Louisville 6/18, Winterland 10/16, 2/22, 2/23, 2/24, Missoula, etc.\n\nThe biggest and obvious issue with this recording is it is missing the rare Eyes encore.",
