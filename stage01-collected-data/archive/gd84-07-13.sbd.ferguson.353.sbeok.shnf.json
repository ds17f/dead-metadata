The Scarlet jam goes great into touch but a little less smoothly into Fire.  The Stella Blue was also very sweet and the giant soap bubble hanging over Jerry's head during the final part made it even better.  The Dark Star was accompanied by a slide show as well as a shooting star overhead.  That whole night was legendary",

The 2d set oozes with funked out jamming from beginning to end, the trippy urgency of the Wheel, the plaintiff bleating of Stella, 1984 finds Garcia at both his most vulnerable and powerful.  I saw no shows until 1989 when Jerry was in (arguably) better shape, but looking back at some of the photos of the 84 era, you can almost picture fans gasping and praying (at the same time) that this man, who looked like he would keel over at any moment, was able to produce such amazing music.\n\nThe Dark Star encore puts this show in another realm and at 17 minutes+ it's a pretty good version at that.  \n\nHighly recommended",

Brent's vocals and playing are some of his best. Bill and Mickey are right there too. Fire is straight ahead and right on, shorter than you would think, and some gret solos by Jerry. The real sparks fly after a cool space, the transition into The Wheel is nice with Mickey doing some cool bell sounds on the beam, go to 7/15/84 if you want to hear the most intense beam work, and you  get a joyous reading with amazing harmonies. They rock out in Miracle and again Phil is a monster! Stella is a majestic version, Healy puts  some slight echo on Jerry's vocals and it works out quite  well. His solo is very  sweet and the ending is nice and maybe could have been longer if not for  Bob charging in to Sugar Magnolia, which is a  amazing version. Once again they rock out and you get the whole band contributing and great harmonies. They take a longer than usual pause before SSDD and then bring it on  home, a joyous highlight. The Dark  Star right out of the gate is the best song of the night and is very focused and explorative.

      "review_text": "It was a great night...... Without a doubt, the Greek was one of the most desired tickets of the 80s.\n\nMy desire to see shows there came from two tapes from the previous years 5/22/82 and 9/12/81. The 5/22 has an incredible Jack>Sugaree and the 9/11 has the best CC Rider (IMHO) ever.\n\nSaw the 83 shows and had to come back for the 84 shows.\n\nOne thing that has be noted is the place just boomed Phil's bass.......and he knew it. At any time he could takeover the entire sound system. Never saw anyplace that could so do that as much as the Greek.\n\nSkip forward 28 years to the NYE Furthur run and listen to the bomb Phil drops in the return to Slipknot, only other time I have heard it quite like that.",

The newspaper back in Boston wasn't too pleased to get a story the next morning that tried to weave the scene in Berkeley with the nomination of Geraldine Ferraro as vice-president.  This show was the incandescent coda to a weird week that included taking a pee in the men's room at the Tosca Cafe in North Beach beside Hunter S. Thompson (he autographed that same press pass), \n\nBut the music.....oh the music.",

It was either at the end of the 2nd set or before the encore Phil says \"We're gonna do a little something special tonight, one night and one night only\". Anybody who heard that had a pretty good idea of what was coming. Full moon, Friday the 13th, and some people witnessed a shooting star too. Ironic! (unless it was a mass hallucination - possibly)",

      "review_text": "Scarlet Begonias (Jam) While 1984 isn\u2019t usually what comes to mind when thinking of incredible tours, this is a fine example of Jerry and the band at their absolute peak in terms of listening to each other and creating a vivid space from which to improvise. Jerry\u2019s health was in huge decline during this period, his vocals often being strained to the point of scorched during most of 1983-1985. It wasn\u2019t until after the coma and return to the road in 1987 that he could croon on a regular basis. However, there were often many great nights of guitar playing pre coma. At this point, he was still performing magically on most nights. The Greek Theatre was always a special place for the band and this run was no exception. This night was the first of a three night run and the first back in their hometown winding down from the long summer tour that started out West, moved to the East and then Midwest. This night among other things was known for the breakout of Dark Star for the first time since New Years 81 and more interestingly played as an encore, While that was satisfying in its own right, I believe the Scarlet Begonias \u2014> Touch of Grey \u2014> Fire on the Mountain was the barn burner of the show. This jam in Scarlet, prior to the move to Touch of Grey, which hadn\u2019t ever happened before this night as far as I know, was intense, full of energy and great band syncopation. Paul and I are constantly looking for that magic in the music and this was no exception. The interplay between Jerry\u2019s leads, Bob and Phil\u2019s rhythmic foundation, the drummers cool fresh sounds and Brent who had come into his own (almost 5 years at this point) was highlighted by this mesmerizing jam. I find this full of energy and fresh ideas that I have drawn from in countless jams. The pace starts out nice and even and then builds dynamically throughout to an interesting crescendo. What always keeps me coming back to this jam is the upbeat nature of it. Scarlet jams could be sometimes short, spacey or even somewhat measured. There might be better ones, but this is pretty cool. I especially like the tease at the end into Fire on the Mountain, which Jerry actually abandons in favor of Touch of Grey.",

The mid/ early 80\u2019s are somewhat an acquired taste but damn, once you get a hankerin\u2019 for it, you really like it. Licorice any one?!\nNot exactly sure what happened to Jerry\u2019s voice in this time frame. Is there a chipmunk in his chest? Is he stoned? Too many filterless? Persian? It\u2019s so weird that his voice came back in 88. \nAnyway, I love the sound. I really do. And his guitar is tight and fast and dirty. \nThe whole band worked well in this period. Perfect mid 80\u2019s example here. ",

Space > The Wheel has a few minutes of some of the most heart-meltingly beautiful sounds I've ever heard them make. And then, the Dark Star encore! One of my handful of favortie Dark Stars ever. As one reviewer put it in their review on Heady Version, \"It's so beautifully sexy!\". I agree. This show was enjoyable from top to bottom! Dig in!",

Thank you for this. It's a real sweet memory and truly great show. \nAlso for some reason I remember people had coolers of beer in the venue?  That can't be right but it was the first Burgie beer I ever had. Haven't seen it or heard of it since...",
