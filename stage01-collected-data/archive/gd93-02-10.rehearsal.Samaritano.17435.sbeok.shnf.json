Vince does actually sound pretty good, and it's interesting how much Jerry really influenced the parts that Vinny did on these slower tunes, by telling him when to arpeggiate and when to play pads.

I can just imagine Jerry's state of mind as he's sharing his gut - it's definitely the man at the twilight of his career and life split wide open for all to see & smell & feel..  the 93 Nassau version is downright spooky, LA 12/19/94 was the last place i saw it & my skeleton is still vibrating...even all the anotated lyrical analyses cannot begin to explain the effects of this powerful combo of words & music; it's trance in a jam, it's beauty in mudd, it's warm & fuzzy on the edge of frozen & sharp..., these rehearsals creep me out - i gotta go play with my kids.   love is the answer",

This song is one of the last examples of his song writing genious (which he seldom exhibited during the 80's and 90's as evidenced be the Poor to Mediocre album material and shows filled with new, bad Brent, Bobby and Vince songs.

In shows, Jerry's voice often gave out. And I never liked Vince at all.\n\nBut this is appealing. It's a good performance by Jerry, vocally and on guitar. When he was healthy (and mostly in tune), the voice of '90's Jerry had a rustic quality. For instance, Jerry is great on \"Not for Children Only,\" the 1993 album he did with David Grisman. The sound here is a lot like that album, which, like this bit here, is not overproduced. There's a lot of feeling in this performance as well.\n\nIf Vince only would have played acoustic piano on this, it would have sounded a lot better. Jerry's guitar is also too low in volume. \n\nBut this is very worthwhile overall.",

      "review_text": "It's a rehersal of a NEW song My first dead show was in 1967, but I've only been able to attend a tad over 300 shows...\n\nPersonally, as a musician and engineer, I think the GD had two peaks, one in 77-78 and one in 89-90.  Sadly, from '91 on the great shows got farther apart - you just don't feel great every day when you get old!  Sad fact of life.\n\nBut there are shows right on into 1995 where Jerry just shined and the Band was beyond amazing.  Listen to Autzen 23Jun90 or OMNI 1Apr90, the MTX or Litz AUDs if you doubt.  In Autzen they watched Little Feat just burn down the house - and they played the tightest, best show of any I have ever seen or heard.  As the great shows grew further apart they also increased in greatness, IMHO, and not by contrast.  Diabetics have good and bad days, about 50-50 if you get a lot of rest.  Of course, road touring is tough - look for shows with a break before it, when Jerry was rested - thar be th gold!\n\nDue to the quality and the historic value I give 5 stars to this 4 star (quality-wise) recording to attract more folks to give it a listen!\n\n\nCan't agree with the comment about the Band overall lacking tightness in the 90's.  They were, in many ways at their tightest, and among the greatest professional performers, as a band, as any band in history.  The vast majority of music experts share this opinion.\n\nIf by \"tight\" you mean \"wired\", then I agree.  You can't get \"tight\" like that at 50 like you can at 30 - it just don't feel good like it did.\n\nThis amazing recording is a rehearsal, not a concert.  The sound engineers may not have even been present.  Especially on a new song, you're working on the song - the engineers know what they're doing, that's a given.  In most rehearsals I've been in and seen, the engineers make sure everything is working and disappear, unless called.\n\nThis is a real piece of history, and I would love to get my hands on more of these!",

Fadeaway\n4) Touch Of Gray\n5) Built To Last\n\nI'm sure very few would place Built To last in the list.. but I really like the song. I love the way Warren sang it with the Quintet. Check out Phil's Red Rocks July 2001 free sbd for an excellent version. Warren does that H/G song major justice.\n\nI enjoy reading everyone's comments on this page, the 90's, studio nugs, Vince, etc.\n\nWhen they first bust this song out there were some very spine tingling versions.. esp. Spring and Summer 93.. after that newness wore off.. the song seemed to create a lull in in energy at the coveted post-drums Jerry ballad slot. \n\nIt never evoked an audience response like So Many Roads. That fer sure. Cheers!",

In either case,since this is a rehersal it really doesn't matter all that much. I have been a fan since the late 60's and have listened how the band sounded over the years. I have never been a real fan of this song,partly due to it's extreme slowness. But one must keep in mind that the words will dictate the pace of the music. Given the meaning of the words to this song,it really can't be sung or played in any other rational way. Afterall ,we're talking about a person getting into an age where the world has beaten them down a bit and it is a recounting of the idealism of youth and what it means now ,if anything. This is really a true G/H song that only those two men could know. So only one voice can be sing it well and feel it more.",

He actually cried when he played this for the 1995 show and said \"This was us. This is our story.\"\n\nCombine this with \"So Many Roads\" and it will break your heart. How sad it is that Jerry lost it all to Persian heroin.",
