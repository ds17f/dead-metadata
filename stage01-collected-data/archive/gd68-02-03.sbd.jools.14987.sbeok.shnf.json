One of the earliest readings of Dark Star, and presumably one of the shortest, begins as a straight verse/chorus adventure. The China Cat that follows in the same straight vein, but gathers steam until the drummers swell the groove into a spiraling descent through swirling musical colors arriving a last in a cacophony of sweaty feedback. \n\nMakes one wonder whether folks were hopping up and down on the Crystal Ballroom's spring-loaded dance floor or if they were just sitting in stunned silence while their collective mind was being seriously blown.",

      "review_text": "First \"The Eleven\" If, as a previous reviewer mentions, the 11 sounds choppy, don't forget, this is the first time they played this in public.  \n\nIf you want to know how they got to fucking around with non standard tempos (The Eleven in in 11/4 time signature), read about it in Mickey Hart's \"Drumming at the Edge of Magic\", a fantastic read.  Basically, the Dead's more complicated edge sprouted when they brought on Mickey, and Mickey had been influenced by Ravi Shankar's tabla player, Alla Rakha, who showed him how you can split up the beat into any groups large and small and combine them at will.\n\nBack to this show.  It's one of the \"Sacred Seventeen\" (or 16? what's with 3/17 being put in \"(17)\" like that??) live shows that was used in the mixing of Anthem of the Sun.  Be aware that the original puke green label mix is far superior to the later \"normal\" Warner Bros label mix.  \n\nEvery one of these shows are so fresh, daring, edgy, and with set lists to die for.  There was something special about this point in time, early '68, where you feel that they finally arrived at who they were.",

      "review_text": "The Eleven I'm in the middle of a project undertaken by myself and a number of other GD enthusiasts that attempts to form best of song versions lists and we are currently on the eleven. The first confirmed performance of the tune is on 1/17/68, which, luckily, is on the archive. As is 1/22/68. I'll agree these are a bit rough around the edges, but at least for the above mentioned versions, the jam from china cat>the eleven is stellar primal GD. There are just under 100 versions of the song, my suggestion is to listen to every single one. Great song. \n\nThis show incidentally is well worth the listen.",

      "review_text": "Here I Go I own three of the shows the Dead played on their tour of the Pacific Northwest. 1-20, 2-2-, and this show. I'm comparing these sets to the three albums made by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. And here's my opinion so far.\nThe Eureka show, which kicked off the tour, is Electric Ladyland. Some nice vocals at the beginning but the playing (jazzy and swinging in Clementine, emotionally empowering in New Potato Caboose and explosive in Born Cross Eyed through to the gentle end to a very short Dark Star) is the most beautiful thing I ever heard. My favorite part during this whole sequence is during Space when the band slows down a little bit and then Pig starts up the Spanish Jam theme.\nThe February 2 show at the Crystal Ballroom is my favorite of the three. This is Are You Experienced? because not only is the playing phenomenal but the singing is exceptional to especially for Bob Weir. Clementine is the track to listen for here.\nThe February 3 show is Axis: Bold As Love as they all sing very well and the jamming is short and sweet but does not become to aggressive or emotional.\nI am voting this 4 stars because the Other One suite is great but it doesn't hold a candle to the 2-2 version. If New Potato were not on here, it would probably get three stars. If you want to find a magical transition from China Cat into Eleven get the 2-14 show.",

      "review_text": "Top-notch Anthem-of-the-Sun show These shows are during the period they were recording and mixing Anthem of the Sun, a 6-month project that gave the band focus and helped them crystallize a unique and polished psychedelic sound. This is one of the shows that was used in Anthem.\n\nChina Cat sparkles, a short but brilliant shooting star. It\u2019s followed by an energetic The Eleven. The band delivers a very tight Cryptical>Other One. I love these Anthem-era Other One\u2019s, electric intensity with Pigpen\u2019s organ providing color--he really goes at it in this one. New Potato is also great, again, with Pigpen an integral part of the sound. Bob sounds great on vocals, and the jam has a nice bounce to it.\n\nBorn-Crossed is a standard for Anthem fans, but it\u2019s actually a rarity, performed only 14 times. Even rarer is following New Potato, as it does in Anthem and here. The two work well together. It sounds like some of this Born-Crossed Eyed was used on Anthem.\n\nFebruary 1968 is an outstanding month of shows near the end of the 6-month Anthem of the Sun recordings. The run of 2/2, 2/03, 2/14, and 2/23-2/23 Kings Beach Lake Tahoe (Dick\u2019s Picks Vol. 22) are all outstanding shows in an outstand run of Anthem shows. You can also throw in 1/20/68, and it rivals any run in the history of the Dead.",

      "review_text": "It's amazing how much they grew as a band in less than a year If you listen to this and then the 10-13-68 Avalon show, you can hear the development.  This is really a proto-Other One suite, very short, although the Cryptical reprise is very nice.  Dark Star is very short also.  New Potato Caboose and The Eleven, however are both fully realized versions.  \n\nIn one way at least, they sound better here than later, and that's due to Pigpen.  Despite anything you might have read, he was right there with them in the early part of 68; T.C. only coming in for the studio work.  I suspect that either he got disgusted trying to keep up with Garcia and Lesh and gave up or that his alcoholism got in the way.  I think his playing in 1-2/68 sounds better than what T.C. was putting out a year later.  That may have been due to the mix.  Pigpen is much louder here than T.C. on, say, Live Dead.",
