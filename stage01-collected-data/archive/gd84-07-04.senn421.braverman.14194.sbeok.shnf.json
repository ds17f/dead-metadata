It was twenty years ago though, so I won't be too hard on myself. Anyway, the jam and quality of the recording are both good and worth the download. It's not in my top ten best or worst it is just a solid slightly above average mid-eighties show. \n\nI also remember being parked in small lot directly acorss the street from the Five Seasons. The auditorium was inside a hotel which was unique. After the show people were shooting fireworks out hotel windows. I heard an unconfirmed rumor later that it was Lesh. I made about fifty limited edition t-shirts for the show. They were red and on the front it said grateful dead with a picture of Jerry in the middle. each letter was hand-drawn to resemble dripping wax cascading off of Jerry's head and shoulders. I think it was pretty trippy. If you were there and bought one of those, make sure you say hi here.",

      "review_text": "I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS NIGHT!!!!!! it was young in my grateful dead career (of touring)I had seen several shows already and was ON the bus. I was definately on some serious LSD, I remember that...but other than the increadible guitar playing in Help/Slip/Franklins, here's what I remember most: During the first det I used to like to roam around the arens, you know, kinda check a new place out...I was young and exploring the world for the first time. So anyways I was walking through the crowded hall making my way through looking for friends and places to danse when along comes this guy who basically looked like a homeless person...no judgement, I just thought to myself, \"hmmm, here's a local guy who somehow got into the show\". And he was definately drunk...that's what I figured. Also he was black. Not that there weren't black people at dead shows, it's just that this added to the strange juxtaposition of this guy, not dressed in a tye dye or any type of hippy rags kinda stumbling through the crowd...kept on truckin' through the place havin' a good time.\n    Then 2nd set. I decided to get up close to the stage to see Jerry in action..I weasle my way up there, real close..and there is this guy. I was a bit baffled. The show started to become VERY psychodelic and they broke into He's Gone...OUR FRIEND HAS HIS FIST IN THE AIR SINGING ALONG TO EVERY WORD WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT AND A TEAR IN HIS EYE!!!!! and that was the exact same thing I was feeling at the time...ecstatic.\n    That day I learned what a \"true Deadhead\" is. It is a person who loves the music of the Grateful Dead. Not what you wear, or the drugs you get or how many killer bootlegs or kind bud that you have. It's a simple as that. A person who loves the music. I wish I could of met that guy cause he was a true deadhead and a true hippy deep down inside. Just like Jerry was, one of us.\n    And yes, this show SMOKES!!!The music is hot...tons of tripping people and LOTS of fireworks after the show. Phil....we know it was you, c'mon, admit it...\n    *1 sad note...on the way to the show there was a car accident with a hippy bus called the rainbow bus. If you listen Bobby says \"this is for the rainbow bus\" right before He's Gone. I believe some lost their lives.\n    This was about my 5th of over 200 GD shows and I will remember it as one of the best!",

      "review_text": "First Show The wheels fell off my cassette copy of this show long ago. Btw, I'm pretty sure Paul was killed in Indianapolis a few days earlier when he stepped onto the street and was hit by a car.\n\nI remember Doug spilling red wine in the car on the way to my first Dead show. Up until that point, the trip had been uneventful, except maybe for those doses we'd all consumed before catching the highway to Cedar Rapids. Everyone thought the spill was hilarious except for Chuck, who just happened to be driving to his first show while dosing on liquid for the first time. Luckily, before the blood had been permanently banished from the hands gripping the wheel, he caught an exit off the interstate. The mood in the front seat improved dramatically, but just for a second. We were about even with the local po-lice station when Dewey realized we were going down a one way street the wrong way. Chuck white knuckled it past the seemingly infinite rows of police cruisers all the way to the next intersection and finally took a left. Problem was, we were headed past another side of the same official looking building while still traveling the wrong way down another one way street. The edginess of the situation filtered through the on-rushing buzz translated into hysterical laughter by at least three of us. We were all happy to find a parking space, even if it was a mile from the concert; by then, the the doses were really kicking in. We started wondering toward the venue and were within sight of the arena before Chuck realized he'd left his ticket in the car..... \n\nEntering the Five Seasons Center was like walking into another time. Gypsy travelers transformed into sufi dancers before our eyes. Doug and I managed to make it up to the third row on the floor under the speakers on Phil's side of the stage before the lights went down and the crowd erupted in nervy anticipation. \"We'd like to start the night off with a drummer's choice,\" Bobby said after some lengthy tuning, and the band launched into \"Stranger.\" \n\nI noticed the couple having sex in front of me right off. She turned to face the crowd and positioned herself against the stage barricade while he unzipped his fly and stepped under her short, denim skirt. \"Doug,\" I said, nudging my sunglass sporting buddy who was already grooving deeply to the ethereal tune. \"That couple up front is doing it.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" he asked. \n\n\"Having sex.\" \n\nDoug watched the couple for a minute, after they finished the act. \"Its just the drugs, man. Don't worry about it.\" \n\nSoon, my attention wandered to the two headed rhythm hydra bathed in sapphire light at the back of the stage, four limbs rocking and four rolling as One. About then Stranger came to an abrupt end and the band made the smoothest of transitions into Friend of the Devil. But this wasn't any ordinary Friend rehash from the studio album I'd been listening to lately. Instead, the band gently slipped into the song at about half speed. I became confused. It felt like swimming through Jell-O. Luckily, before I could get mired in the lyrics, Doug nudged me with an elbow. \"They are doing it!\" he said, nodding to the now confirmed fornicators in the front row. \n\nI snapped out of the spell and turned around to see if the folks behind me were catching the same show. But the couple behind me only add to the strangeness. Her face was painted with make up and she was wearing an evening gown, head crowned with a diamond tiara. He was decked out in a tux complete with top hat, tails and walking stick. The thing was, they were both only about four feet tall and I couldn't decide if it was a couple of kids playing dress-up or little people dressed to kill. I got the courage to glance back over my shoulder a few minutes later and was fairly sure they were adults. My observations and beliefs were repeatedly challenged during that, my first set of live dead. \n\nThe set break brought a welcome respite. The four of us planted ourselves in a circle in the brightly lit hallway and Doug broke out the smoking paraphernalia. The dose felt stronger in the hall than it did during the music. I wasn't' sure we should have been smoking out in the open like that, but no one else seemed to care and I was tripping-so-fooking-hard that I could use a toke or two. Just as I was adjusting to the fact that I couldn't understand a word of the conversation swirling around me, the lights went down and we made our way back into the great hall. I wondered toward an open patch of floor a hundred feet or so from the stage. Things were getting a little too claustrophobic up front. The band launched into the second set and my reality started taking on an electric green hue........ . Exotic tones emanated from the back of the stage, the remnants of a far out spacey voyage through time. Then I felt myself somersault into the rafters and back to ground level. \n\nWe spilled into the street after being unable to find Chuck. Luckily, he met us just outside the doors. We moved out of the current of hippies and squatted on the sidewalk running along the venue. Chuck told us of his decision to remain in the hallway after set break and how he'd first become mesmerized by the twirling and dancing hippies and then terrified. His fear had propelled him out the door and security wouldn't let him back in. So he'd spent the second set eating pizza with a friendly hippie chick who had been shut out, too. Chuck never went back and I never left.....",

Other than the 7-13 friday the 13th full moon darkstar, my 1st, with the shooting star......This show was right at the top with everything; The holiday, great music, friends and family,and - for me an exotic local being from NC. I was at Iowa City in 82' and because of the way the tour ran all the east coasters skipped so there was one of the smallest contigent of heads to locals ratios by far that I ever saw. Way more heads at this show. I am sure it was because of the 4th. I also remember the fireworks. Except they were coming from the parking (rumor that Phil was setting them off - that IS a funny one!) and it was a war zone,they were shooting them at us. It was crazy. Great fun!",
