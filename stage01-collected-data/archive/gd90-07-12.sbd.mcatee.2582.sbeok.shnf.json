Jerry is strong throughout this show and the set list is awash with nugs from every era of their hallowed past. Performed in a GIANT rainstorm, the perfect mix of this recording lets you feel just enough of the crowds enthusiasm at the \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2rain\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 parts of songs to really add to the listening experience without effecting the clarity of this soundboard recording.

Clear as a bell too, despite some feedback which is only present in the beginning of the song. Jerry's vocals are strong, he really puts empasis in all of it. Live shows like these really make me wish I could have seen them, but - (sigh) - too young to have really followed them.\n\nAlso, Box of Rain is one of my favorite songs (but let's face it, they're all my favorite songs). Anyways, this is one of my favorite versions. No doubt. The end really takes on a mellow tone and, it's just really a great song in general.\n\nAnd Dark Star's awesome! AH! :)\n\nThis show's 5 stars, or Dark Star's shall I say! lol.",

Jerry's playing on this version is definitive, all the little melodic/harmonic loops that can be jumped through on this tune are all absolutely nailed by the fat man.  When it finally ends, you get the feeling that it's because there's nothing else to squeeze out of it, and Fooolish Heart just hiccups into gear out of Victim's ashes.  And then the Dark Star....whew.  Download this show now !",

The band played to the crowd, with an energy of old that kind of shifted a little after Brent's passing.  This show is a treat & one that should be in the collection of anyone who appreciates Brent, Dark Stars, toying jams, and hot rainy summer shows!  Listen for the maxwell house coffee jam, beer barrell polka, woody woodpecker & funi-fucali(?) jams between songs.  What a night, what a show, the music never stopped!

All those elements were enough to make it a very memorable event, to get a show like this one\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s special!!! RFK is a great stadium for sports and the band always seemed to play great shows their. The \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c273 shows were legendary; this one is on par with that, just in a different era.\nWhere to begin, the rain storm\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Ah the rain. Anyone in attendance could attest to high heat and humidity of that day, the first set rolls around the sky darkens, and by the Bertha, the sky opened but it wasn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t until the Music did the thunder and lightning really kick in. It just poured buckets, and everyone rejoiced in the deluge. I never was caught in such pouring rain, and loved it so much!!\nThe Music. Simply outstanding. The first set was a rollicking good time throughout. Each song had such a bouncy feel to them. Stranger, Bertha \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ran into a rain storm\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2, Stagger, Tennessee, Cassidy,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Whew the Music closer amid all the rain, the band sounded as if they fed of the pouring rain!!! Beautiful midi flute jam going on there.  The second set Foolish / Victim superb, but the Dark Star was the Beast. Wonderful exploration around the Star theme, then the Band showed their teeth and got out there. Brent went sick on this version, what a statement. Overlooked was the excellent placement of Touch to close the show. Excellant sounding recording...get it!!!!\nThanks Archive!",

      "review_text": "Rain Rain .. I Don't Mind Like other hometown reviewers, this show is literally seared into my memory (may have been the heat/humidity + \"dry\" summer that left the whole east coast um ..wanting).  I remember Edie making some cryptic reference as she walked off her opening set about enjoying the ride and not 60 seconds later the sky above RFK turned black and the rain pouring down.  \n\nThere seemed to be some question as to whether the show would even start, but the boys slogged through, Brent's \"we might get a little wet\" reference in Good Times Roll was received with the pop from the crowd you would expect.  The real heart of this show of course is the 2d set, after the \"floor\" had been turned into a muddy swamp and the rain stopped.  The trippy take a step back with Phil giving the random countdown and Healy echo chambering the voices is classic.  Phil treats the crowd to a Box of Rain which is eagerly scooped up into a mind warping Victim with odd images being thrown up on the large screens and a hypnotic opening into Foolish Heart.  You will get a goosebump when you hear Mydland's ticking to launch Foolish and Jerry's leads are absolutely spot on.  T\n\nhe Dark Star was the full freak, the whole crowd just going absolutely ape s*** and the lengthy intro, 6 plus minutes allowed everyone to truly appreciate the moment.  The band went all the way out there and back before relinquishing control to the devils.  The back side of this set is also very strong, another chill inducing moment when Brent's powerful vocals come in (albeit early) on Mr. Fantasy.  The man had sick sick pipes.  The Weight had just recently (3/28/90) been played so it was a real treat to catch it as an encore, absolute icing on the cake for one of the most memorable nights this reviewer had with the Good old Grateful Dead.\n\nThis is a lay-up 5 star show, must have for any fan of the band.  Top 5 of the year.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

      "review_text": "five-star from start to finish I may be a little biased as this was my favorite show of the 50 I attended, but i have got to tell you that this is five star material. The band is right on and the energy is huge. The quality of this recording is awesome and does the show justice. The tape of this show has probably been my most listened to and i am pleased that this recording captures almost the same energy (my tape has a little more audience reaction/sound). This recording brings back the memories of standing in the center of that field hearing the massive sound resonating through the stadium. The rain fueled the energy from the beginning with the openers let the good times roll, stranger and bertha just rockin' the joint. The thunder boomed around us as the set closed with tennessee jed and music never stopped emphasized by flashes of lightning and busrts of awe from the audience. During the intermission, after escaping a large crowd encircling a mud wrestling extravaganza at centerfield, and watching a dwarf coated in the red-brown sludge crawl out from under them and dissapear into the crowd, we were approached by a random girl who came up to us to declare; \"high, my name is marta, i knopw, it rhymes with farta, my parents cursed me when i was born. Well i'm going up front to tell phill, when he comes out, \"box\" and he'll look at me and say \"box\", and they will open the second set with box of rain.\" Well she dissapeared into the crowd and when the second set opened with box i was blown away. Victim>foolish was phenomenal. Hands-down awesome, only topped by a complete darkstar before drums. Watchtower rocked, I always loved dear mr fantasy>jude reprise and this was the last and how about closing out the second set with touch of grey. Just a clasic example of the 89-90 sound, the early jerry midi and the last of brent. like I say the band was right-on, great setlist and a premium recording; a must-have!",

Victim>Foolish Heart crackles with anticipation of the looming Dark Star and damn, it was a fierce one.  Brent's thunderous intro gives that away quickly.  This 2 verse monster could just as easily be tracked Dark Star>Space>Dark Star.  Maddening. All other reviews are right on.  Superior SBD, raucous energy by band and audience throughout. Brent's goodbye to some folks I guess.  If you lived in the East and missed this one you were bummed.  Not to worry though, a year later they played another scorcher at RFK with Hornsby.",

I know it's nice to have some Aud in the mix but I'm still not sure how happy I am with the quality of this Board.  I will say it is much better than the multi-gen tape I had before.  I think the problem is with the og board itself.  BUT YOU STILL MUST DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW!! \n     This was my third show.  I was still new to the scene and after seeing a spread @ Dominguez Hills I wasn't quite ready for the East Coast RFK thing.  My friend and I walked into that HUGE stadium and were awe struck by the bigness of it all.  Even noobs like us could feel something was going on once the band started playing.  It was a genius 1st set, even though I didn't know some of the songs yet.  Once the 2nd set started, it was on.  I'm not a box fan still but it felt special.  The victim is still my favorite of all the shows I've heard and after its chaos, foolish feels so sweet.  Then after we thought the trippiness was over we get a Dark Star.  Just huge.  After space was classic Late Brent with a Fantasy and jude.  I still feel lucky I saw the Dead before Brent died and this was a great show for that.  I've heard this era called the Golden Age of the Dead and I agree.  Except for a few Hornsby shows(thank the lord he came in)  it just got worse after this.",

Not my first show (I was fortunate enough to have my first be Hampton/Warlocks/DarkStar '89) but definitely up there as one that most stands out in my mind, without a doubt.  It was my first outside venue to see them play and a \"hometown\" show for me as well (a Maryland native myself).\n\nThe rain...oh the sweet, sweet rain.  It made the show, if you ask me.  Honestly, it was my most fun show.  After that I almost wished it rained at every outdoor venue I saw them play at - never did though.  This was the first and last rain storm show for me.  On the floor, close up to the left of stage the entire show.  It poured buckets during intermission and coming back down to that area after intermission to a MONSTER MUD PUDDLE brought on the biggest perma grin that my face hurt by the end of the night! :) Talk about feelin' like a kid again. WOW! Fun, fun, fun!\n\nSOoo soooo many good parts to the show, but the one song that stands out in my mind is \"The Music Never Stopped\".  The most RIPPIN'ist \"Music\" I've ever had the pleasure to witness and the best I've ever heard in any recorded show, period.  Jerry just absolutely lights it up after the midi flute jam.  He steps over, taps the pedal, off goes the flute and on comes the heat...like only Jerry can deliver.  Brings chills everytime I hear it and just thinking about it now is doing the same.\n\nAn absolute must have.  To get a glimpse of the magic that night, pick up \"View from the Vault II\".  It's RFK the following year ('91 - another stellar show - missed Brent but Hornsby/Welnick pick up the slack with ease - the constant grin on Hornsby's face is priceless - Jerry really enjoyed playing with him) but has \"Bonus Footage\" of the 1st half, 2nd set of this '90 RFK show (Box>Victim>Foolish>DarkStar).

We were a little behind Brent about 20ft from the fence/stage for all of 1st set, and yes, Bertha was rockin' while they \"ran into a rainstorm.\"   By the time we'd made it upto some seats after 1st set I SWEAR that the people playing & sliding in the mud were smashing together & their heads were exploding---like I said, the mushrooms were fine...

Like many here it seems we all had our 1st Dark Star @ this show & I can recall chills all over when I realized what they'd started playing.   Unfortunately, this was the last show I saw with Brent, but I guess it could've been a bad show, so this was an acceptable send-off in hindsight.\nOne more part of the story...   On our way home to Frederick (Fredneck), MD on 270, we saw a bacon samich w/someone pulled over about 2mi from the Monacocy River Bridge--so I slowed from 65 to just under 60mph.   About a half mile later there was ANOTHER car pulled over, so after passing this one I sped back up to 65.   I never saw the pig before he was behind me with lights blazing just after passing the Holiday Inn.   I obediently pulled over and \"you were going 67 in a 55, blah, blah, blah---you're not carrying any contraband in the car, are you?   Would you mind if we searched the vehicle?\"   Now many of us may recall similar circumstances & wasn't it always put in a way that seemed you had NO CHOICE but to say \"yes\"?   Anyway, while sitting in the cruiser signing the speeding ticket, bacon samich asked \"there isn't anything in that car you don't want us to find is there?\"   \"NO sir.\"   BUT, while watching the other PIG rifle through the car with my wife & friend standing in the drizzly rain, I started to almost literally shit my pants as I watched said PIG pick up the bag of bread that we'd used to help wash down the mushrooms---mushrooms that were in their baggie and were stuffed into the bread bag.   He picked up the bag of bread and then PUT IT DOWN & GOT OUT OF THE CAR!!!   All WITHOUT the shrooms!   I can remember thinking \"oh shit, I'm going to jail.\"   Got home in one piece though, and slept like a baby.   Many might remember this as the start of the Frederick Sherrif's pulling over cars on 270 coming from shows down @ RFK or the Capital Centre.   I took alternate routes after this year.\nPEACE!!!\n\n5/25/07 addition----I don't know who put that this is a SOUNDBOARD, but you can CLEARLY hear all the chatter around the mic that recorded this show.   Yes, everyone in the band can be heard clearly, but this IS an AUD copy & we should be able to DL it.",

People were passing out.  The rain and the Dead provided perfect relief.  We all had tickets, but this was my girlfriend's first show (!) so we walked up to purchase tickets and by 1pm they still had some left!  We still have her ticket it says \"Obstructed View.\"  The whole day and night was trippy like that.  I am amazed that 60000+ people could get together and have communal experiences that were so good, I wish there was some way we could all get together again.  \n\nEveryone at this show needs to write reviews because this day was so rich in Dead lore.  My memory of Dark Star > Drumz was from the upper deck we observed someone releasing glow sticks into the air on balloons and they rose up and flew out of the stadium.  One by one as each floating glow stick blew away from the stadium, one by one the boys left the stage after some serious space action.  I swear, as they came back on stage for Space, some glow sticks appeared to float back in.  Did anyone else see this!  \n\nThe other part that blew me away was the Hey Jude reprise, from the crowds Na Na Na nananana to Jerry's crazy smile and off key singing, there was a feeling of 50000 heads in unity with the band and just for a moment all was right in the world.  I guess you had to be there.  The screaming Jerry solo and Phil interplay that followed was the reason we kept going to all these shows.",

The band sounded stiff and didnt have the shake and bustling energy usually associated with really great shows. This performance sounds sloppy and i'm in the middle of Cassidy. Buffalo 90' is much tighter while maintaining that loosness.I would give the sound quality a 4.I'm looking forward to the 2nd set and Dark star.I dont like the way the drums sound in this mix.I must admit this show was a disappointing surprise after just listening to Pittsburgh 87'What a show that was!Box of rain is better than the first set then looses umph!!I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch.I'm in the mood for a good 'Victim' Bobbys voice sounds powerful and clear...sorry..Still struggling.Foolish heart is flat as a tire. must be the weather conditions hmmm.'Foolish' begins to pick up steam 4 minutes into the song.Mickey is trying to tighten things up, no longer is the beat dependant on a simple snare drum.Nice jam at the end then they bust out 'Dark Star'.Iv'e never heard a weak Dark star.\nJerrys MIDI stretches things out, adds texture. Things get real interesting 10 minutes into song and it never lets up. Wow!!Excellent drums, aggressive and later trippy. I would say during drums the show 'peaks' unlike it ever had before.A 'spaceship' lands onstage a little after 10 minutes into drums.Jerry turns the MIDI on and leaves me in an abstract mental world then things get boring after a while as the MIDI  usually is . Spaces where more interesting Pre-Frost 89' I think Milwaukee 89' was Jers last time he played space without MIDI.The end of space gets better.Watchtower is confident.Dear Mr. Fantasy is sluggish. Hey Jude is incredible.Touch of grey is certainly more snappy and tidy than the rest of the show.a skip at 1:40.Phil is tearing it up.The weight never really works...My longest review and it wasnt that good of a show",

Also I agree with someone who called out Victim. Not a favorite tune of mine but this version is played flawlessly. IMO Victim is a first set song. Its too much of a mood changer to be played in the 2nd set. Along with my first show, 7/13/89, this show is my favorite. This whole night though ranks very high as \"MOST PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE\" of my life. Thanks buddy for that kind microdot !",

However, I just stumbled into the archive via another website and found myself reading people's accounts of that unbelievable day in DC. I, too, was there. Dead center, 20 rows back; Where I saw the majority of this tour. \nI couldn't resist writing something...  the rain, wow; it was coming down hard. Complete downpour. The stage was a waterfall. Water streaming off the lights into the color saturated air. It was amazing... the music was beautiful that night. Dark Star brought out an eruption in that stadium that has goose bumps shooting down my arms as I type. What a feeling. The shear uproar was enough to bring you to your knees. I was completely blown away. This was one the most memorable moments in my life for sure. And from what I've read; many of you as well. I believe this show ended with one of the highest energy show closer I ever saw. (if you were there tell if I'm talking of the wrong show, but I believe I'm in the correct arena) As Touch of Gray rolls, all the lights in the stadium come on. No more colored stage lights; the white stadium lights come on and there is the most unbelievable site of the night. The rain has stopped, and the crowd is going crazy. It was amazing to look around and see EVERYONE. Then this 40 foot skeleton (puppet) gets pulled up next to the stage. It was truly an amazing show. What a cool feeling it is to relive this a bit. I will download this for sure. My aud. bootleg is not so good, as I recall, because of the deluge that pounded this show. \nIt reminds me of another cool rain event that took place that summer I believe. Was anyone at the Greensboro show at NC state football field ( i think)? When the band shorted out... amazing how they returned.. and the hilarious antics of the crowd during the delay..",

      "review_text": "Kim's bus came by... ...I came in hot from Pittsburgh, took two exams from summer school and rolled into RFK, armed with rolls of stickers that I got from a grocery store bakery department in Pittsburgh.  In the heat of the day, I walked the lot and gave out \"Fresh Baked\" stickers.  As I was cruising up one aisle of vehicles, I came across this gal kick-n-back against a 1968 1/2 VW Microbus Import with the seats ripped out and the whole insides covered in yellow and orange shag rug.  The license plate was Kiqnbac.  She had a water bottle and as I anointed her with a sticker, she gave me a cool, refreshing squirt.  So I planted another sticker on her and was rewarded with another squirt.  Soon she was wrapped in stickers and I was soaked with water and we tumbled into the back of her van for some other refreshments.  Little did I know that it would be the beginning of a spontaneous cross-country trip and a beautiful friendship that's lasted through this current day.  As a bit of foreshadowing, I recall seeing a guy with a cardboard Coke case sign saying Dark Star RFK-1973.  \n\nAs for this show, it was one of the best shows of the era and certainly is deserving of the 5 stars.   I remember that we left the floor and went to the top of the RFK for a refreshment, then came down into the downpour and stood at the back of the field.  The air was so thick...it was like bits of humidity breaking away from rain drops to hang suspended in the air and Box of Rain just fit right in.  I don't quite remember the rumbling slide into Victim, but the haunting exit out of it fit the liquefied air.  \n\nI need to pause for a moment, because my spine is tingling with memories...  \n\nThe Foolish intro was, next to the epic Foolish intro from either Shoreline or Cal Expo on a date that currently escapes me, downright silly.  The whole thing was ballistic.  I surely got airborne during the Foolish jam before the last bits of lyrics.  We were shin deep in watery mud that would make Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs proud.  I recall Brent's keyboard tinkling away the last remnants of the song...and then Dark Star came roaring out of the ether and my brain just about exploded.  \n\nI became Jesus and Moses all at once, pushing the water aside whilst walking on the flying dollops of watery mud, giggling like a madman and dancing in my own private epileptic way.  It was, to me, the 2nd neatest Dark Star ever (there was a 1st set one 8/16/91 that had me giggling too) and I feel blessed to have experienced it.\n\nThings got a little runny for me and I sort of regrouped around the start of Mr. Fantasy.  This, as it turns out, became my favorite rendition of that tune because, at the end, the boys were singing both Fantasy and Jude at the same time.  My recently regrouped brain took on a bifurcated existence as I tried to sing both songs, well...simultaneously.  I feel for those around me who had to listen to the drenched madman try to sing in harmony with himself.  \n\nAfterwards we got miserably lost insofar as we couldn't find the vehicles, but things were dripping into each other quite a bit and we found a drum circle under the overpass which went over the Anacostia River and that kept us busy.  Eventually Kim, her rider and I retired to my place in Greenbelt and, a day or two later, we set off for untold adventures that only exist on the road, on tour and now and forever, in our memories.",

The jamming in and out of Foolish is unusually long and even though Jerry gets a little sloppy on some of the verses, the playing blows the energy out of the water. Dark Star is good and not too effecty, The Weight closer is fitting given the time.\n\nMost of all, to see this kind of energy from Brent, weeks away from his untimely death, is magical and gave me faith in what i consider to be a much weaker tour than the previous stronger spring tour.",

He then mentioned that his whole bag was full of those special toppings and I proceeded to to get them all from him. Got to the show and man was it hot..... I was then donned the pizza man for the day and many folks were very happy. I ate some of those toppings and started into the show when the dark clouds started looming. the rain will save a lot of people from heat stroke I thought, including myself. I was under the overhang on the first riser when the show started and the sound was muddy. It was cats and dawgs and people were complaining about the rain and sound. I told them that they had no idea how to have fun or where the best sound was. so..... I made a mad dash into the mud behind the soundboard. by the time Bertha(ripping by the way) hit it was on. not perfect but we all knew something special was happening. I was covered head to toe with mud(so was every one else).....solid first set. the box (one of the best of the era) for sure of the year. back up vocals are spot on. Into a rippin victim. one of the best ever, and i'm not even that big of a fan of the song. Wow Jer is all over it. into foolish, which is not the best but who cares when you get that kind of intro to the star, easily top 2or3 in the Brent era, maybe the most interesting. Sick d/s into watchtower. Fantacy hey jude realy put the topping on the cake for me when 100 or more of us joined in a circle held hands and sang hey jude together. Does anyone remember? Anyone who was in the mud on the field had a life changing experience that day unless they just didnt get it. touch was as smooth as it gets,and we all had a great laugh when we tried to find the heaping piles mud that contained our stuff.

Edie Brickell opened. I saw Paul Simon once and she sat in the seat next to me. He stared at her for every song. She stared back adoringly.\n\nFirst Set. Starts average. There's a hint of a <i>Beer Barrel Polka</i> tuning, into <i>Sing as We Go</i>, into <i>Funiculi Funicula</i>, going into Bertha. I honestly don't know the best <i>A Little Light</i> of the 21, but this one's not bad at all - a slightly different arrangement with a Bobby & Jer punctuation chord and maybe a Bobby verse would have made this one a keeper. The best performance of the set is actually <i>Queen Jane</i>. Who knows why Bobby wanted to perform this one - aside from being a Dylan fan. It's the weakest song from Dylan's best album and was often a bland wordfest on a Dead stage - though strong here. <i>Stagger Lee</i> however is enough of a trainwreck that they take a 2 minute break, not completely recovering before setbreak. <i>Tennessee Jed</i> is shaky as fuck but the solo's great. Jer tries for Deal but they take a break instead.\n\nSecond Set. The set is average to below average for '90 when, slowly, persistently, <i>Dark Star</i> swirls up into one of the best of the year (9/20 is the best but the second best is either this, 3/29, or one of the 2 Denver ones). It skids into textures that devolve with the intent of squeezing you schematically through the pinhole universe so you can stand amok t'other side. This carries through <i>Drums</i> as well. The rest is flat and gets worse by the end. <i>Hey Jude</i> is torpid and way off-key. <i>Touch of Grey</i> is rough-as-shit bordering on OUCH! <i>The Weight</i> is the 5th one, right after it was moved to the encore slot. It tries very hard to trainwreck - if not grind to a halt.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C-\nOverall = 2 1/2 Stars (2 stars plus 1/2 considering the lengthiness of the highlight) \n\nHighlight:\nDark Star>Drums - 36 minutes of one of the year's best excursions in the middle of a below-average show\n\nSOURCES: The Miller doesn't have the clarity of the McAtee SBD, runs <u>1.5% slow</u> and has cuts in Touch of Grey and Hey Jude. The McAtee needs <u>+1% pitch</u> to sound correct and then has the best sound. The Weight is cut off on all SBDs, so use the Nicks matrix (which sounds better than some of the SBDs anyway). It appears that the board had a  mic outboard - but it's definitely a SBD with an AUD mic and not a matrix. <b>View from the Vault II</b> has three tracks as bonus material (both the DVD and CDs), and yes, includes the Dark Star.",

The police were parading through the parking lot that year worse than ever before, not to mention is was well over 100 degrees and people were freaking out everywhere. On the field and by the time Edie Brickell came on it was almost unbearable. All that changed and literally the skies opened up on Jer's first note! The rain added necessary relief from the heat but turned annoying as the night raged on. The band...they were The Dead, high notes and not so high notes, pretty typical. Some of the arrangements were a little weak, but that's nothing new. A great set list and lots of energy all night long. One of many great shows from RFK! Considering Jer's shaky voice most of the night and some disorganization, one of my favorite shows! Hell I'd give anything to see the worst Dead show one last time!",

Today man I am extremely, extremely grateful for this one. Personally getting what I need from this second set, the salve for my soul ( and from 10/08/16 JRAD , if any one wants to hear a seller performance from them check out the whole show but especially the jam that leads originally into Crazy Fingers then weaves an incredible web through numerous tunes ending in a version of Hippie Dream with Chris Hereford featuring on guitar and vocals) ...\nHey now, Victim>Foolish, even whGn Jerry flubs a verse, that has become one of my modem day favorite combos. The possibilities with Victim such a dark song, it has a feel to it I always liked that song and since my first show was 4/1/95 with that high energy second set opener the song has a place very well kept in my heart. \nThen what is perchance, the best Dark Star of the last half of the the Grateful Dead performing years down into the drums/space and beyond. . And the rest of the show like I said but this is it. Pinnacle performance from the 1990 summer tour \nGod Bless Jerry, Phil, Brent , Billy , Mickey, and Bobby and \nPig and everyone involved in the band, in the crew, man the whole GD Family..and of course the people who put this here . May the Universe bless them and theirs like I was blessed  just to be able to hear and feel this when I need and have needed to. There was and is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert and what this can do for you if you just let it. You want pinnacle? Right here",

      "review_text": "Magic in the air It was my second dead show, followed by many more. I didnt even know all the words to the songs yet. But it was awesome ,it was a dry summer for weed and me and my buddy scored a quarter of kind from an old hippie, I dont know why he chose us to sell it to,we were only like 18 years old. also got some hits of real strong lsd. Drum circles under the bridges because it was so hot and the only shade.we went in during Edie Brikell and started to peak. I remember the clouds rolled in hard and as soon as jerry played the first note: RAIN. so refreshing just before the rain i was so thirsty. The concert of course changed my life and was going on tours by the next year. Songs that stood out Let the g times roll, Bertha,Dark Star.",

Maybe it was just my own experience, maybe the beautiful girl parked next to us, but damn! One of my favorites shows I attended in 90.",

How could you not???? The entire stadium was bouncing up-and-down!!",

      "review_text": "Great Show, Awful Dark Star I was there. I only remember bits and pieces, and the first set is very well played. Heck, everything I've heard so far. But, uh, this Dark Star sucks. Jerry is croaking the lyrics. Ooof. And I don't want to yuck your yum, but all the MIDI-crap, which I don't like really on any song, really sucks on Dark Star. The weird woodwinds or that pan pipe sound crap... Spare me. I love Jerry, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. But as a guitar player myself, give me Tiger and a Twin and I'm good to go, tone-wise. Sorry if you disagree. As Dylan once said, \"It's only my opinion. I may be right or wrong.\"",

      "review_text": "First Dead Show Ever, Had a Ticket Unreal.  I'd revert back with details, but the cow herd into the stadium was epic, the entrance for the opening lit up the sky with rain, the lightening struck, the dark clouds rolled in and rain unleashed and a wave of fog was cheered as far as DC could hear and the rest is Grateful Dead history.\n\nThe green van with the buddha statue was traversed and a bean burrito or two had.  I believe I even joined the drumming/bongo sessions out in the parking lot.  A sea, and mass of humanity, so hot that water bottles absolutely needed and going fast and helicopters hovered about and above through the day.  Wild, just absolutely epic, exhilarating first time experience.\n\nWonderful experience and wild, wet ride.",
