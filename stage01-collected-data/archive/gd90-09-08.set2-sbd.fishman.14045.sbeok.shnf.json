I cannot wait until that comes along because it is worth it.  This is a fantastic show for only Vince's 2nd live gig with the band.  Actually that is one of the draws for this show, he is still learning the groove and provides very basic keys that add nice color to the sound which leaves room for Garcia to get busy.\n\nThe Eyes>Estimated>Terrapin> is long and well played with the jam out of Terrapin making it on to the Box Set So Many Roads.  Jerry takes a few bars to kick his guitar into Watchtower but it has a nasty sound that kicks this version up a notch.  Stella & Throwing Stones>NFA are above average. Saturday Night is rocked out but cut short on this copy.\n\nSound quality is very good with everyone in the mix most of the time but a little muffled.  I would advise to get this and pray that the 1st set comes out sooner then later.",

The Eyes>Estimated>Terrapin is well played and jammed out. The highlight for me was the eerily wonderful jam out of Terrapin. Something about that low sound out of Garcia\u00c2s guitar along with the rich textures that Vince provided, get to me. Get the 2nd set!!! Thank you Archive!!",

The first set is solid (too bad its not here), with deal, cassidy and sugaree being highlights.\nBut the second chapter of this show is where they really belt it out. I agree with the others that the eyes>estimated>terrapin is extremely solid. Its a jam I play over and over in my car.\nThe eyes is long and smooth with tons of tricks  and it seems Garcia is warming up for the estimated>terrapin which shook the house (it was one know those nights where you looked up at the stage and all you see is white bright lights and hear a screaming guitar)\nBobby gets a litte too excited during the end of throwing stones and messes up the final verse.  Other than that put on your seat belt and enjoy the ride. \nA rating of four.",

Wince's fills actually contributed nicely to a uniquely eerie vibe - one that permeated much of the second set. All-in-all an excellent representation of late 1990.\n\nAll that's needed now is a board of set I..!",

      "review_text": "an all time great! I LOVE this show. The second set sequence of Eyes>Estimated>Terrapin is superb, and I told Dick Latvala himself this in person when I had the opportunity. Certainly, I was pretty surprised when the \"Jam out of Terrapin\" appeared on the SO MANY ROADS boxset. He must've read all the postcards I'd sent to him. Anyway...\nThis SBD mix is a bit misleading, as is the AUD recording available here--the keys were nowhere near as prominent as either recording would indicate. Perhaps my pre-show puddle has fogged things, but I know this wasn't the case in the arena itself. I used to have a copy of a Healy matrix broadcast board of this show, but haven't been able to find another one. Oh well. \nTHIS SHOW SMOKES. Even though this was reportedly the first time the band had used a setlist in forever, you can tell the band is on and ready to go. Note the heavy and rapid MIDI choices Jerry blasts through during \"Eyes\" and \"Estimated.\" Pretty sweet; he even gets the super-reverby-tuba-at-the-end-of-infinity thing happening, which is ALWAYS nice. Even the OMSN is great! I remember Bobby's rockstar moves (which were very pronounced) as though this show happened yesterday. \nAfterward, my friends and I stopped at a McDonald's somewhere outside of Cleveland and the woman at the counter (who discerned my rather, uh, \"altered\" state) gave me and my friends an incalcuable amount of free grub! Very nice. Really, nothing but great memories of this show and all that went along with it. Don't trust the haters on this one--it's a gem.",

You could tell that band was bringing Vince along slowly, you hear very little of him. Fantastic shows both.\n\nI cannot remember which night, but I found a huge bag of pot on the floor on the concoarse. I decided to gift it to a young man, He looked to be quite well on his way anyway. He was very happy to get it. I wonder if he remembers; I wonder if this guy will ever thank me.",

I think we both lucked out!  Eyes>Estimated>Terrapin is out of this world.  And I bet a real wake-up call for Vince.  The Richfield shows were strong, as a whole, no question.  And this is no exception.  Tim always had a knack for showing me the dope shit, and for that I thank him.
