What I remember more than anything is that it rained like hell while lined up outside the gig and once we were let in, water was everywhere inside the venue. As temps rose, so did a steam-like fog. Hanoi Jane and Tom Hayden were there to shill for their cause(it was a \"Rock For Life\" environmental cancer fund benefit) and the crowd was fired up for some R & R and  yelling for \"Jerry\" and \"Dark Star\" etc. Jane was visibly rattled by the lack of interest in what she had to say. A somewhat current Jane movie w/George Segal(sorry, can't remember the title) was played on a big screen lowered from the stage. \nThe Dead's set was long and full of tunes, many that hadn't been played on the west coast in some time. Listening to the show all the years later, it seems the band was somewhat tired and uninspired. Donna was especially out of it. Shortly after this gig, it was announced in the local newspaper that K & D had departed from the band. I wasn't surprised. Overall, this isn't a must have.",

I didn't know it at the time, until later before Brent's first show that this was their last as I hand held my microphones over my head Donna was clearly checking me out as I recorded while she was singing \"From the Heart of Me\",(not her best performance; kind of sad in retrospect), but like others, since a board came out I recorded over it.\n     This is an early example of Garcia starting to really stretch out and improvise on the end of \"Terrapin Station\", as well as a great \"Lazy Lightin'\"->\"Supplication\" amongst other things, as the other folks have said! This was a Cancer Research benefit called the \"Rock for Life\" with Jane Fonda and Tom Haydn introducing the band and one of her lesser known pictures playing beforehand \"Fun with Dick & Jane\".\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

Also, this was a fund raiser for Tom Haydens political/social organization, the Campaign for Economic Democracy.  'Hosted' by Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden.  They showed the movie \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" before the concert.  Set one absolutely took off right from the start with Greatest Story Ever Told.  Big energy and upbeat songs, one after another.  Band solid, tight and seemed to be enjoying themselves.  In retrospect, one sees how they wanted to give the Godchaux's a hell of a send off.  I remember Lazy Lightening/ Supplication as sssssmokin'!  Another historical piece worth having.  Excellent energy and playing.  Four stars.  PS- soon after this show, Rolling Stone did a piece on Tom and Jane, and their campaign and in it they discuss a 'cute', family moment where Jane Fonda, at this very show, is trying to explain to her daughter how come Deadheads are the way they are.

      "review_text": "A memorable show, But not for the Right reasons. 1st set: The groundwork is laid down for an exemplary set by the undeniable positive momentum of a fine \"Greatest.\" Wow, Jerry is really reaching for the stars early... there's little \"Ease-y\" about the notes he's wringing out of his trusty sidekick. (BTW, did Jerry have nicknames for his guitars?) \"Ease\" was breezy. \"Mama\" is sharp and concise which segues into a bright and snazzy \"Mexicali.\" Finally, the heart can stop palpitating with a delicately played \"FOTD.\" None of the musicians color the music with busyness. Oh my goodness, \"Passenger\" thunders over my speakers like a 19th century steam locomotive. It just amazes me how this band could go from a booming blast of bellowness to a fragile, lilting \"To Lay Me Down.\" Wonderful choice tho it's sung too fast. This version clocks in at 6:30 when there's at least 8 1/2 minutes of unrequited soul waiting to be extracted. Bobby counters with a poignant \"LLR\" that oddly fades away in its last few moments. \"Jack\" barrels in sounding like a lost cut from 'Workingsman.' Unfortunately, this solid stream lacks \"Lazy/Supplication\" which is a shame because Bobby works himself into a foaming lather at the end of 'Lazy.'&'Supp...' the latter of which brings jaunty Elaine-esque (Seinfeld) contortions from my bodice. \n\nA quality 1st set... one of the better and most consistent I've heard in a long while. \n\n2nd Set: A joyously boozy \"Might\" opens up the final set in Donna and Keith's Grateful Dead lives. Let's continue to allow the stadium rock out with a riotous \"Miracle.\" Bobby is really in virile vocal mode tonight; apparently, his barking is a subconscious reminder to Donna for what she'll be missing on the road... Anyways, W is really alive during the outro. A very fine version. \"Bertha\" is more restrained but still enjoyable as it gets deliriously happy at the end. You think, we're not getting the terrible threesome?! \"Good Lovin\" is just as alive and vibrant. You make the call: Would you rather suffer through \"From the Heart\" and Keith's increasingly non-active piano or Brent's overeagerness and \"Far,\" & \"Easy...\" \"Big Railroad\" is fine, but not really what this set requires; what would be nice is some Meat, some substance.  The blessing makes its way through \"Terrapin.\" Quiet at first, the Terrapin builds standardly. \"Playin\" is a nighttime adventure. Confident in its sparseness, it bare-bones presence contrasts well with the earlier over-the-top renditions of the rockers. Additionally it eases the transition to the rhythm devils. \"Space\" comes and goes with a flash, and we're given life lessons courtesy of \"The Wheel.\" Uh oh, the effort's there... But the energy is beginning to sag. Yet something interesting happens, the pitter-pat of the cymbals, and then a very odd, intruiging intro to \"Shakedown\" occurs. It's as if they're in soundtrack, fooling around with the opening arrangement. It's mostly a timing issue, but Jerry's guitar sounds tinnier/higher than the norm. Anyways, it's a slow-burning, jammy, longer than usual intro...The participants have little interest in the song as it serves really as a vehicle for Jerry to elicit some call and responses from what soon will be an ex-partner of his. Attiudinally, I'm harkening back to the spacier sections of '74 shows. The \"Playing Reprise\" comes from out of nowhere. It's standard despite an elongated mild cymbal-fest at the end. \"Sugar\" gently rocks out. oooo, nice whooo-out by donna in the bridge. We encore with a strong \"Saturday\" forcefully led by the growling maestro and his shrieking ex-paramour. \n\nAnd that's all... no final bow/curtain call for the departing Godchaux's... at least nothing on this tape.  Admittedly, I was hoping for a piano man's choice/or at least a ballad with more weight. Any of the big three ('Wharf,' 'Stella,' or 'Black') would have been appropriate. And how could you Not encore with 'Breakdown' after 'Saturday?' \n\nDon't get me wrong. This is a Very good show. But the lack of gravitas considering the importance behind this gig concerns me. Feelings may coarsen over time, and this band's interpersonal dynamic was obviously emotionally repressed, but that's No reason to Not pay public tribute to a couple who toured with you for the majority of the decade. I'm left with the sensation, \"That's it?,\"  and I'm writing this 26 years, 4 months and 4 days from its inception. A haunting disappointment- Keith never recovered and Donna toiled her way into Christian obscurity. This is Not the venue to continue my rant, But, for a band that truthfully conveys the wide spectrum of emotional/spiritual life through their songs, this show's lack of recognizing the significance of what should be a Grand send-off would have let any wise prognosticator to view into his crystal ball and fear that this band was Not yet through with the ides of tragedy.",

Donna's last Passenger rocks, as does Done Ease Me In. High Time is also a highlight. But it's the second set that shines. The second set song transitions morph into one another, smooth and natural, as in the pre-1976 years. The Playing in the Band goes to some interesting places as well.\n\nI agree with jboyaquar below that Keith and Donna should have had a farewell here. Feelings were hard between the couple and the others, probably exacerbated by over-medication. In a interview with David Gantz, Donna said that they were all \"wasted,\" which isn't great for interpersonal relationships. But a tribute or recognition was warranted here. Keith was the best keyboard player the Dead ever had. \n\nIt was also disappointing that Donna wasn't on the reunion tours of \"the Dead\" a few years ago. I guess time doesn't heal all wounds.",

They dropped the bomb after this show because they knew there was a break in schedule until April so they picked this time to go and give them time to find someone. \n\nBrent was playing with Bobby solo and he was thought of right away plus since he was a deadhead already and knew a lot of the songs so the break-in would be quick.
