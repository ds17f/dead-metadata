The Let It Grow just plods along, a very unusual and undesirable tempo with the drummers very conspicuous and distracting.  Jerry was seemingly incapable of putting together a coherent solo, or at least I haven't heard one yet.  Seems to be a fairly dismal and unsatisfying show from the very uneven final weeks of the band.  I'd say the Seattle shows from the 25th and 26th were the last two great shows.  This one can be let go unless you were there.",

My question, then and now: how could the band let this happen? Garcia is so clearly on his last legs. He attempts only five tunes in the whole show!!?! and they are all miserable failures. Reprehensible that they would even consider taking peoples' money with Garcia in such life-threateningly bad health. My $.02.\n\nChuck Berry was at least somewhat entertaining. He'd be cooking through some tune, and he'd play some cool lead lick, and you'd say to yourself \"that's awesome!\"...then, often within seconds, he'd play some lick so badly you'd go \"d'oh, that's terrible!\" This went on and on, several times in every song...What a goofball. \n\nBTW, the JGB show from this same venue on 8-8-93 was outstanding, despite JG losing his voice. Get it if you can.",

Sure it's the mid '90's...they're a little sluggish...they're showing their age... and the timing can be a little off. That's obvious, but sometimes you have to just go with it. And sometimes it makes the high spots even better. This show has some sweet spots in it. I thought that Jer did a fine job on the 5 songs he sang. The tempo on some things is a little off here and there, but for the most part nice and sweet. Thank you teleprompters. \n\nI didn't mind paying for this show at all.

I love a great aud source when available, but when the wind is blowing in such huge open spaces, it's pretty tough to capture that Djini in the \"bottle.\" Anyway, these final West coast tour ended up being the last shows I saw. Fortunately, I caught em all. Being a student at the U of O, but from Chicago, my \"bad\" habits had gotten so out of hand, I didn't get my shit tgthr in time to make it back East, and missed those last days. I will forever regret that. Anyone that has the balls to get so crytical of the band in those last days, should have just took off, and found something else to do w/ themselves. If it was really that bad, then why did you continue to subject yourself to it? I stop doing things when I feel pain from doing so. The Dead were never performers of perfection, and I don't think they were aiming for a perfect perfection. They were musical Shammans trying to bring about a spiritual experience though musical expression. It did not always happen, every night. By the end, I was able to accept that it might only happen ever 3rd or 4th night, it was always worth it. That's my $.02",

It doesn't mean you don't love or care for them anymore, you just hope they get better.  For people who think that critics of the band at that time should have just quit going is like asking family to not visit their dying parents or loved ones.\n\nThese people supported the band for many, many years so you need to lighten up on the old timers who had a difficult time watching Jerry die before their eyes.",

I think he did an abysmmal job on them.....\njust my $.02\n\nWhy did the Dead continue playing with Jerry like this? Well, it's probably pretty hard to hang it up after 30 years unless you are forced too, especially when you still sell out 80,000 seat arenas, and have a couple hundred mouths to feed. Unfortunately 8-9-95 forced them to stop.\n\nThe story of Chuck Berry playing a great lick followed by a clam reminds me of what Jerry sounded like during this tour and Summer 95.",

Back in 92 when the big boy went down from exhaution, a lot of these folks took it hard. Again i wasn't there but my thoughts based on what i heard.",

      "review_text": "This is too long to read It might be in the forward of 'Box of Rain', the song book, where I think Hunter said they never put the lyrics in w/ the albums because each song had a unique meaning to each Head, and he didn't want to screw that up for them/us. I am so tired of reading negative reviews from you morons. Jerry gave his life to the music. The lifestyle took him from us too soon. My first show was in '92 (Yah, yah!). Those last few years were the best of my life. I had such amazing experiences with all of you, and 'the boys.' Even being new to the scene, I could sense (especially the last few Shoreline shows, for some reason. And especially 'the wheel',) that the long, strange trip was headed for home base. I could see the wheel slowing. Maybe coming to a stop  altogether. I knew for sure that we were a part of something uniquely special.\nThis Portland show was very special to me. My partner and I did great sellin 'Jerryade' t-shirts. ('Thirst quenching sound with every 'drop.''  We had 'The Tacoma Coma.' We had our own hippie crack tank. And, I got a pass to go up front to take pictures. I usually leave out the part about being so baked that I didn't realize that it was only good during the first couple songs. I went up as drums started and got some great shots of Bobby tapping the mike stand for effect. I strolled past Vince as space went into Watchtower. Which was great, for me! Then, as Black Peter got started, I saw an empty space about 6' by 6' right in front of Jerry. I looked at the guy standing at the back edge of this empty space and shrugged my shoulders as if to say, \"Is it ok if I stand here?\", or \"What the hell! Is this some type of vortex?\" The 'purple jesus'' was really workin'. It seemed like he gave me the 'O.K.' and I jumped right in. (In retrospect, I should have parked my ass right there.) Jerry proceded to play the best 'Black Peter' I had ever heard. (ok, so I only heard a few.) My self, my camera, and everything else was in perfect harmony. Jerry was was lookin' straight  through the lens, which translated into my eye, then my soul. just then the wind came... He didn't seem to take his eyes off me. maybe halfway through Pete I ran out of film. I couldn't believe it. Honestly, I new I would be seeing 'Jesus', so I only brought a couple rolls that day. (I feel like I wasted most of the first one one Chuck Berry, who was awesome by the way. [Not so much the music as it was the experience of seeing such an influential rock legend.]). Had I known the flood gates of a deadhead photographers wet dream would open that day... I'm sure the heads in front of me would have hoisted me on their shoulders, but when you roll on up, you know you gonna roll back down! What's this? This rolls done. gotta load another one before they bust out some - DARK STAR/ST STEPHEN/THE ELEVEN/LOVE LIGHT - shit! Ah... No more film. I   looked around kinda askin' for film, but I don't know if anybody understood that shit. I don't know if I did. And, Yeah, Peggy-O, Wange Dand Doodle, Row Jimmy is one of my least favorite combos, the over all song selection was beautiful. This recording sound good through my pc speakers.?.     OK. Got the headphones on now. Sounds great. It was a beautiful weekend. Jerry fuckin' blew it out til the end! I get pretty sad sometimes, but remembering this shit makes me happy. Remembering happy times. 'It's all a dream  we dreamed one afternoo-oo-hoon long ago.'     -----    Oh my God!  I just listened to the end. Very loaded buy now. The significance of 'Box of Rain' is ...It blows me away.  There were some GREAT Dead tunes that day, my friends.",

I don't know what changed, but I just listened to it with headphones and I enjoyed it immensely.  There's still alot going on as only the grateful dead could nuance....if you listen intently. Black Peter is fantastic.",

      "review_text": "It was 20 years ago today . . . I just watched the NetFlix presentation of 'The Other One' and wanted to stream some good ole Grateful Dead. The good thing about GD is almost any calendar date they played a show. Some are better than others, but the good thing is, they're all here for us to enjoy for free. 20 years ago tonight finds us in Portland OR. How many times have the Dead knocked it out of the park in Oregon? \n This show begins with a fairly safe Jack Straw opening up like hundreds of GD shows before it. Moving into a nice Peggy-O, smooth comes to mind. Something familiar maybe to help chew up the miles as the white lines fly by. Wang Dang has a funky board vibe to it, but again nothing extraordinary. Think 'safe'. Nothing mind crushing, no one having a total meltdown and going crazy. It makes me think of some of the WDD's from even just a few short years before. What a difference!. Row Jimmy was pretty solid. 'Broken heart don't feel so bad' older, and a little wiser. Poignant. Bobby paints his masterpiece and reminds us that 'Yes, it sure has been a long hard climb'. BEW feels fairly standard, even if the old man is just getting on. Let It Grow is probably one of my favorite Bob songs, and you can feel Mickey and Bill trying to pick it up a bit, seeing where else they can take this song after 20+ years. Just a few moments shining through towards the end before the break, but overall it leaves me wanting more.  \n Samson starts us off in the second set nicely. I fumbled around looking for my seatbelt for a moment, but alas, didn't need it. 'Way To Go Home' was way way too long. Not my cup of tea, but hey, different strokes for different folks. Crazy Fingers so far is the highlight of this show for me. Crisp, bright, and thoughtful playing. {Forgotten lyrics and all} Corrina shakes it up a bit. I always liked that catchy hook. Funky and kind of spacey. Jerry's soulful moan is not unlike a San Francisco foghorn. I love it, but definetly an acquired taste. Drums > Space > and a little more Space are also worth the price of admission. Yikes ! Say what you will about the '94-95 lack of Jerry, but some of my favorite Drums > Space are from these years. Watchtower sounds nice coming out of Space, but nothing spectaular. Again, nice and safe. I kept hoping with all the average reviews maybe they were missing some classic Bobby here. No dice, just average. Black Peter was cool, but then Around was fairly lackluster. Phil is called on to help close the show and doesn't let us down. Quality sound, but otherwise just an average show. Boy what I would give to be in the front row though. \n I didn't download this, and probably wouldn't stream it again, but hey, it is after all The Grateful Dead only a month before their final show. Kind of like Chinese food, you know you ate, but feel hungry an hour later.\n\nHappy 50th Grateful Dead !!",

I barley remember the show and thought I would never come down even three days later which sucks. I'm so glad I'm sober now and I get to remember Dead & Company when I see them =) Going on tour from 93 to 95 was very special! I will never forget all the great experiences I had!",
