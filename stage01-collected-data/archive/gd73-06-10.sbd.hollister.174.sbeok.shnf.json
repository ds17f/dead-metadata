If you were Jerry, and you knew some of your musical peers, the Allmans were listening backstage, what would you do? You'd play your ass off, right?\nThe first set starts with Morning Dew,the 2nd with Eyes. Need I say more? Okay, the Bird Song,Playin and Dark Star are fantastic- Jerry is in true form.But wait - who's that joining them onstage for the 3rd Set? The Allman Bros.? Here's where the trip gets twisty folks, for at times you can't tell whether it's Jerry jamming with the Allmans, or the Allmans backing up the Dead. Who cares? It's fantastic! Can you say supergroup? A must have for 1973.\nDr. Flashback :-)",

The soundman finally gets comfortable and settles in 7 songs later around \"They Love Each Other\".\n\nThe levels are low on this recording. Once downloaded it is a good idea to put it through the wang-dangger (your sound editing program)and raise the soundlevels to max out at 0db. If you are skilled at normalizing you may want to normalize. I only add a smather of normalization because too much diminishes overall instrument dynamics and the quiet breaks.\n\nThere is a lot of squeeze and fluctuation in the high end as if someone mastered this using dolby on a non dolby encoded tape.\n\nThere has to be a better audience recording out there somewhere.",

After dropping acid and running around the hot sun for most of the day, I slept through most of the A Bros.  The Dead were OK and except for someone firing off a pepper gas canister in my section of the stadium it was a nice day.  At the end of Saturday night we were sitting around watching the crowd leave and at some point someone announced on the PA that if anyone was interested they could come up and get a big garbage bag.  If it was returned full you would get a free ticket for Sunday. So thats what we did. It took about 15 minutes to fill a bag and sure enough they handed out tickets. \n\nOn sunday the Bros went on before the Dead.  At The end of their set, half of the audience left the stadium. So what had been a massive audience was reduced to a nice private party for Dead Heads. Either Bob or Jerry commented on it from the stage and invited everyone to come up closer. As you can see by the two days set lists, Sunday was the killer show.",

Firstly, it's in D.C. in all hallowed RFK Stadium, which automatically makes it a contender for best show status (betcha didn't know that rule).  Furthermore everything about this show is great.  The Dark Star is in your face and smacks you around like the little girl that you are.  So does the Playin'.  And who's gonna argue with a '73 Eyes?  Not me, because I would lose that argument (never doubt the oratory skills of a '73 Eyes).  Furthermore, the third set with the Allman Brothers contains some of the sweetest music I've ever heard.

This was my second (out of about 30) Dead concerts (my first was Baltimore Civic Center (9-72).  This recording proves that listening to the Dead depends totally on your state of mind and mood.  The first few times I heard it, I thought the sound quality sucked (was flat), then ... driving to the beach (about 3 hours) I listened to it with the background noise of wind through the windows (which in a strange way minimized the sound quality blemishes), and I was on a flashback to the state of mind while I was there that day in 1973.  Garcia and Lesh are absolutely in a parallel universe (and universes parallel to each other as well) during the breaks on certain songs (They Love Each Other/Loose Lucy).  These are songs I generally don't prefer.  But it just proves that the Dead can inject a mindblast into the break of any songs they play (favorites or not).  What is amazing about the Dead is after 30 years of listening to them, I have never tired of their music, and am always hearing something new I haven't heard in live performances that I have listened to a hundred times or more.  As I said, Ithe music changes with your state of mind.",

GET THIS if they put it up again, otherwise they might make an album out of it.",

We got married a week later. \n\nThe show was enhanced for both of us and my mind was completely blown apart by the music.  I had no idea why the music souned so strange at the time but Phil had his guitar wired each string to four huge stacks of speakers about 70 yards from the stage.  He played with the stadium echo during Playing in the Band and I haven't been the same since.  I can't speak for the experience of my wife but an interesting story evolved that day.\n\n\nYou did not need a ticket because after the Deadheads got in some of them opened the other gates.  The stadium ultimately ran out of food so we tried to leave to eat during the break.  When we got to one of the gates, a rent-a-cop says, \"Where are you going?\"  Both of us freaked, turned around and walked back into the crowd.  These rent-a-cops were riding around the RFK stadium on scooters and all Heads were toasted.  It was scary and in our enhanced state we thought that they had decided to keep us all here for observation or something.  We actually found a pay phone, called home to tell a friend who was to arrive for the show the next day and informed his girlfriend's uncle that they won't let you leave when once you get into the show.\n\nA while later we found another gate to our liking and the guy let us leave as long as we knew we couldn't return.  Out in the parking lot we managed to get lost, asked directions of another Deadhead who spouted something unintelligable that made perfect sense, we drove around the lot together our car and his in a vast maze.  My wife to be were lost in that lot long enough to see before we left that there was a single cloud over RFK with a rainbow running through it.\n\nI have only been able to verify the truth of this story with my wife of thirty three years this June.",

Wet Wille, Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead. The Dead closed one night and the Allman Brothers closed the next. I'm not sure which order. I of course had listen to the Dead on albums and \" eight track \" but never live. Eroupe '72 was the latest album. To say the least I was hooked. The jam with both bands on \"First There is a Mountain\" was a show stopper. As luck would have it I moved to Hampton Virginia in '76 and was lucky enough to see every show the Dead ( or Warlocks in '89, killer Dark Star,) ever played there. So this set brings back alot of good memories for a 50 year old Deadhed. The Wall Of Sound the Dead used in ' 73 added to the experience.\n\nGive Peace A Chance",

      "review_text": "Don't Believe the Hype I agree with bradcheng a few reviews ago, I don't really see what all the fuss is about with this show.  I was really stoked when I downloaded this based on the excellent reviews.  After the first few songs I was disappointed but kept listening.  This lasted throughout just about the entire first set (with a few exceptions - They Love Each Other, Bird Song).  I found the sound quality to be poor, maybe the worst quality I have heard from the archives and I have over 300 discs of GD music from archive.org.  I also found the playing uninspired.  \n\nI will say that the 2nd set picks up a bit and there are great performances of Eyes of the World and Dark Star.  I was actually jamming right along through He's Gone and then came Wharf Rat.  This is without a doubt the worst performance of this song that I've heard.  \n\nThe 3rd set (4th disc) has some memorable moments and some excellent jamming starting with \"That's Allright Mama\".  This set really is excellent and is worth listening to or obtaining.\n\nOverall, although there are some gems in this show (Eyes, Star, 3rd set jams), as a whole it is a poor performance with poor sound.  I'm glad I have it for the few songs that really stand out.  This show has gone from 4 discs to a 2 disc \"highlights\" disc for me.\n\n2-star rating.  For me, an \"average\" Dead show is worth 2.5 stars (not that average isn't worth listening to).  Overall, start to finish, this show as a whole is below average.  The first set gets no star, the 2nd gets 2.5 and the third gets 4.5, so in sum it's about a 2-star show with some outstanding highlights.",

Kinda like going to see \"The Dead\" thinking Jerry gone's be there. I'm sure people in attendance had a different experience than those of us just listening to these recordings, but there are just so many other shows in '73-'74 in which the recording is enough to nourish one's heart and soul --- for me this one just cannot compete with all the other gems. However, anytime Jerry sings \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh...\" deserves at least a three rating. -- AshesRising",

The sound is sometimes a little iffy and the band's performance on some of the material isn't all that. Not that it's bad mind you, far from it, but the first set is fairly average with only Bird Song and Playin' being stand outs. You can skip all the other songs and you wouldn't be missing much. The band picks up some steam for the second set which is much better than the first and contains some real gems. The third set with Dicky Betts and Butch Trucks is smoking. Maybe people really like this show because of it's marathon length and all the extra booklets/artwork it comes with? Which I find pretty cool myself. But as far as quality goes it's somewhere in the middle of the pack for 1973. I was initially disappointed because of all the hype this show gets, but what the hell? It's definitely worth a listen and I'm glad I was lucky enough to get it before the Archive stopped soundboard downloading. Check out 2/15, 2/22, 3/24, 5/26 and 11/17 for some more kick ass playing. \n\nBTW check out the aud version of this show.

Phil is fantastic in both.\n\nThe Dark Star especially is wonderful, where he takes a long solo. After Lesh's solo comes a really unique passage with him and jerry driving the band towards a very melodic and jazzy jam right before the 1st verse. \n\nAnd there are also really nice versions of Here Comes Sunshine, Stella Blue, Hes Gone, and also They Love Each Other, which i mentioned in my previous review.\n\nThe 3rd set with the Allmans is what elevates this show to 4 star material, containing classic jams including the only That's Alright Mama and a great NFA>GDTRFB.\n\n\nBut like i said before, this show is a perfect example of why Spring and Fall '73 are so much better than Summer.",

Many others, maybe it's why my memory is gone, huh?",

      "review_text": "Dead Allman Show We drove down from UMASS. Saturday Dead came on mid afternoon it was hot as heck bright sun 90's.  Early in the set a lady climbed up on stage and handed Jerry a big red rose stem. Jerry put it between his death playing \"Deal\". IT was truly a love fest no problems or violnece.  The people on the infield were baking in the hot sun they turned on the fire hoses and began spraying the crowd.  We moved up into the stands under the roof out of the sun.\nAllmans came on that evening and played a great set.  Sunday Wet Willie then Allmans then Dead.\nBetts and Trucks? joined the Dead about mid night and jammed for another 1 1/2 hours. A lot of the crowd had left we moved down right in front of the stage.  Jerry was just plucking away looking into the eyes of Dickie never once at his own guitar just that big smile and rolling eyes.  It was wild.  Our ride had to leave before midnight to return his fathers car so he could get to work.  We slept on the grass outside the stadium that night. 4 am on a Sunday night and there are these little kids on bicycles riding around chit chatting with us.  We managed to get a ride to NYC the next morning from a kid that had slept in his car all night. Hitched back to UMass from NYC.\nA lot of people might criticize this show but the temps were so hot and the cavernous stadium does not allow for great acoustics.  The show was memorable and fantastic.  The indoor shows  from that era had better sound but not the spirit of this event.  IMHO the Dead were at their best from 1971 - 1977.  Although I never saw them pre 1971.",

But, after they finished their set, it was followed by a MONUMENTAL JAM with a compilation of some of the BEST MUSIC EVER PERFORMED!!! I was one of the lucky few who got to see The Allman Brothers open for The Grateful Dead at The Fillmore East in Feb. of 1970 and again in March of 1971, with Duane when they recorded the famous \"Live at the Fillmore East\".

      "review_text": "A Personal Favorite 1973 is one of my favorite Dead era's and this show is a great representation of this year. The first set has a diverse mix of songs. Morning Dew kicked off the night and the energy level continued to grow with BIODTL. I dig any Wave That Flag simply because of the contextual importance it had to the Dead's repertoire, eventually becoming US Blues. \n\nA particularly brain melting Playin' with one of the best Eyes ever performed following. Eyes is very jazzy and upbeat with crisp keys providing the perfect background for Jerry to play to. The keys are so prominent it's almost approaching ragtime. This is exactly what makes 73 great though, there's such a variety in the playing. It seems almost wrong to love the keys so much especially because this show is so close to Pigpen's death in the Dead's chronology. His death, while a somber event, marked the point at which the Dead were really able to explore their sound without being pushed in a blues/ rock n roll direction instead of their preferred psychedelic sound.\n\nFor me, the highlight of the show is Dark Star. Jerry's playing is bouncy with the perfect amount of echo. Phil is definitely on phire in this Star. Another jazzy rendition as well. I want to point out the incredible jam starting around 6 minutes but really picking up at 7:30. My first time hearing this Dark Star I was absolutely blown away by this playing. I stopped what I was doing, turned it up all the way, and just let those chords pass right through me. Easily one of the most unique jams in a Dark Star. Reminiscent of Allman Bros in my opinion, interestingly enough they were actually at this show and joined them for the third set. Phil takes off around 10 minutes with Jerry's notes seeming to fall from the sky and land like droplets onto Phil's sea of almost tangible bass notes. Gosh, another great moment that just screams Allman Bros is at 12 minutes and ends when they get into the song at 13:30 or so. The band settles into a nice groove here as Jerry sings the first verse. I love how Phil becomes the focus at so many points during this song, especially at 17 minutes. The 20 minute mark turns a little spastic and takes them into a really bizarre, abstract jam that solicits one or two yells from heads in the crowd (maybe they knew an excellent He's Gone was up next) but doesn't do much for me personally. With that being said, this top performance of Dark Star comes to a subtle close and the band creeps into He's Gone.\n\nThe crowd claps along to He's Gone, totally into it. Again Phil's bass slaps me in the face at the 10 minute mark in this song. I'm not quite sure what the loud cracking noise that pops up occasionally throughout this show- sounds almost like a slapstick or even fireworks. Regardless, the jam into Wharf Rat is just as beautiful as this particular rendition.\n\nOnce again the crowd claps and sings along as the band breaks into a quick paced Truckin'. Sugar Magnolia, as opposed to some other performances, is well developed and pretty tight. No matter what Sugar Mag puts me in a good mood. The set ends with Promised Land. For me, no top show from 73 is lacking in a killer Chuck Berry song.\n\nThe whole third set with the Allman Bros is a classic in my opinion. Warren Zevon once said, \"Enjoy every sandwich\" and the NFA>GDTRFB>NFA from this show is certainly a sandwich to be enjoyed.\n\nAll in all an excellent show. One that appeals to all sorts of Deadheads who all have their own favorite eras and songs. Likewise, this is a show which seems to appeal to all sorts of music lovers. The Dead transition so fluidly from rock riffs to jazz grooves to spacey, surrealist jams in this show it will make most people smile at one point or another. I was left smiling almost the whole show, for that I award it 5 stars.",

However, I doesn't seem like I can do anything from my Android phone. So when I'm on here like now and find this gem of a recording but don't know what to do.

      "review_text": "This is The One!! Possibly the greatest show the Grateful Dead ever played.    This is a 3-set, 4-CD monster with so many great jams.   Highlights include a passionate Morning Dew to kick it off, Birdsong, Playin', a very long Eyes, Here Comes Sunshine, and of course, Dark Star.  The end of the second set isn't really any slouch either.  But wait!  There's a whole hour-long set coming with members of the Allman Brothers Band, who played earlier that afternoon, joining in on a collection of covers that includes a 13 min+ hot take on the Kings' \"That's All Right, Mama.\"  The sound is great, too -- this is the rare 73-74 soundboard where you can easily hear all the instruments, including Bob's guitar.  \n\nWhat a generous show, too!  The Dead part of the show is already 3 1/2 hours, then there's an over one-hour set with the ABB guys, and that's not counting sets by somebody or some band called Wet Willie plus ABB in the afternoon (according to Deadbase).  All together, it was probably at least 7 hours of music, stretching from mid-afternoon until around 2:30 AM!  What major venue would let a band play until 2:30 AM these days?  Most of them have 11:00 PM curfews (thanks, Clear Channel!).  And how much did folks pay for the show, even adjusted for inflation?  Probably a lot less than in 2023 as well.",

Sunday was a very special afternoon and night- I'll never forget it. The performance live was definately better than what you get from the SNBDs loaded here. They were so ON I was in heaven. I drifted here and there only about 30 ft. from the stage, dead center. Listening to the first few bars of this Morning Dew again literally gives me goosebumps. The day before was amazing, and I hardly expected them to surpass it, but they did. \n     I'm a big fan of Birdsong, largely for the jams they did within it, and this one is the longest I know of...beautifully rendered. Playin'ITB follows to end the first set, and by this time it was completely dark...and we all got a mind-blowing surprise. Right when the final bars of Playin' started, the finale, someone (Healy?) in the sound booth out in the audience set off some major fireworks high into the night sky. So, during the final chords of the song, we get this visual extravaganza, everybody with their heads tilted back, gazing up in major euphoria.  \nEven though a bit of the magic from how extremely \"together\" they were is lost in these recordings, it's still a great stream, especially Charlie's transfer. Buy yourself a really good desktop stereo if you haven't already, and enjoy!",

And, eventually spit out their heart, bleak from guilt. When you close your eyes to hear this show, or walk about your Day, remember that we are all being lead through time with such Mercy. Played out for us all to hear in one way or another. I don\u2019t shrink to the call of the Dead. I rise up to meet them and embrace each song as their first. Similar to the previous day (1973-06-09, RFK Stadium), what guidance is also found might as well be the continuation of thoughts laid to rest. By the morning, another path is taken \u2014 might have been less traveled, who\u2019s to say. I know what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAnd, yet, I was not there. I have never felt the light of the Dead play to me so sweetly in the flesh. I did not experience a single Tour from the 1970\u2019s. I don\u2019t know that Love. What remains, but the stories? That\u2019s all I could ever ask for, and in some way, the life I live here in this time, is impacted forever because of those simple, unique experiences all of us take upon. It\u2019s a choice to be Alive, a simple decision to Lead ourselves on a path toward Salvation. \n\nPeace ~ Nick.",

But he pulled out a joint from his shirt pocket, fired it up & passed it to me. I didn't say anything either. At the time I worshiped Jerry Garcia and I was so taken with my good fortune to sit within 5 feet of him that I couldn't think of anything to say. \n\nI had a great time & wandered through the crowd, making my way backstage an hour or so later.
