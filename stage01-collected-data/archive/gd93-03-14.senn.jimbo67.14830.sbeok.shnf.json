      "review_text": "What a Weekend Anyone who attended this show or the northeast in general this weekend,can not possibly have forgotten this particular weekend.March 13 & 14 1993 was the blizzard of the century.The Ohio and Pa turnpike's were shut down.Pa had 17 ft drifts and the roads in and around Richfield were covered with feet of snow.However this did not stop the most deadicated fans of the most succesful touring band in history.The band was there,we were there,but The Ohio State police refused to allow us entry to \"The Coliseum\" parking lot on the evening of 3-13.One officer mentioned \"we're affraid if we let you in we won't be able to get you out\".\"Turn on your radio\" he said.The local Rock station outta Cleveland did an excellent job keeping deadheads posted of changing events as well the disappointing news that 3-13 was officially cancelled.The radio also announced that it was the first GD show cancelled in 17 yrs due to weather.\n In true Deadhead form we would not allow the weather to interupt the beggining of a spring tour season that was to be intiguing to say the least,after the previous fall 92 tour had been canceled due to Jerry's health.No we would not let this get us down,hmmm....wonder where to party???? Everybody in Richfield must've had the same idea...The Holiday Inn!!!!\n The Holiday Inn in Richfield was more than generous to us heads,more than accomodating,they opened the entire Inn for us \"all\", and I mean \"all\".There were sleeping bags in the hallways of every floor, ppl opened their rooms to share space with others,the bar was pumpin with the sounds of drums,and bootlegs over the sound system,the alcohol flowed non stop throughout the night.The employees who were also stranded at work for the night partied and mingled all night.A couple of dudes from the Cleveland Radio station showed up(how they got there who knows) and partied with the deadheads all night long,then announced that the band was gonna simulcast the 3-14 performance over their radio station for the fans who had tix the night before,but could not get in the 14th.Starting around noon on the 14th a very eager wave of fans rolled out to The Coliseum and were greeted by smiling police officers and plow truck drivers.The show was fantastic under all the circumstances.The cold ,rain and snow was perfect opener to get a chuckle out of the wknds events.The Don't ease me in was equally amusing.\n The second set however,put all amusement aside and got right down to business and so did the audience.The D.J's simulcasting the show were quoted as saying on the air after the lights went down for the 2nd set \"Oh my....do you smell that???\"\"ladies and gentleman it smells so good in here right now,you'd have to be here to apreciate it\"...then faded slightly in the background \"don't mind if I do\".\n The audience did the traditional 3-14 \"Happy Birthday Phil\" greeting,and the band proceeded to lay it down,the boys did not fail to disappoint a crowd that had been so patient and understanding.The audience did not fail to disappoint everyone all weekend was so kind and generous with one another,and every stranded stranger they encountered that weekend from Chicago to New York.The weekend was evidence that \"we\" really \"could survive\".The show musicaly speaking had it's moments and was def not the show of the century,I would give it 4 of 5 stars.The audience was never desuaded I would give them 5 stars.I would give the community of Richfield,the police,road workers,and the Holiday Inn 5 stars as well.Mother Nature gets 5 stars for throwing one helluva storm.The overall weekend scene gets 6 stars from this old head.Anyone who disagrees with my rating of this show was not there.",

      "review_text": "200 miles in 6.5 hours I was there for the blizzard shows too. I was attending college up in Buffalo at that time and I was coming down for the dead. I had to got west of Cleveland first to pick up my girlfriend,(now my wife for 11 years). Then we were going to the the 3-13 show. Little did I know when I set out that this was going to be a long ride. It was only flurries in Buffalo when I left but things came to a halt before I even got out of NY. The snow was coming down so hard. I couldn't see crap. Well after 6 1/2 hours I finnaly made it to pick up my girlfriend. We saw on the news that roads were closed and that we shouldn't go anywhere but we had to get to the Dead. Well needless to say we made to Richfield but couldn't get in. We ended up with everyone else that night. It was a great time. The next day had to be our favorite time we ever had in the parking lot. We had a blue 75 Nova with bald tires on it and every time We got stuck I bet 10-15 heads were on it trying to get me unstuck. Everyone was working together to make sure everyone had a great time. Man there was a lot of snow. When we finally made it inside everyone knew Cold Rain & Snow was going to start the show. That was the way to do it too. The crowd lit up for that one. Like captain said though the show had a couple moments during it but musically it was par for the course at that time. The crowd it what made this show one of our all time favorites. If you were there you know exactly what I am talking about. Had to be the best group of people to enjoy a show with ever. Thank You for a real good time",

      "review_text": "Huh? Sorry to speak ill of The Dead, but I was at this show and thought it was probably the worst show I ever saw.  You could see/hear Jerry coughing throughout the show, and the playing was very flat.  The first set had a couple of highlights (Cold Rain, BEW), but the second set was a total snoozer except for Terrapin.  The big breakout of I Fought The Law hardly made up for the rest of the show, and basically everyone hated the song immediately.\n\nAs for the parking lot, the cops confiscated a case of beer from me that was in the back of my truck, sealed.  Then, the arena refused to open the doors even one minute early, leaving hundreds of us standing outside in the bitter cold.  Not good times.  Bad times.\n\nJust one man's opinion.",

      "review_text": "One of the worst shows of 1993 -- a monster disappointment. I don't have a copy of this show, because upon\nleaving this night, I had no desire to acquire\none.\n\nYes, the blizzard of '93 caused the first show\nto be cancelled, and it was the right decision\nat that time.  However, for the following night's\nshow, there was one problem:  With the exception\nof a few songs, the GD failed to show up.\n\nThe first set is short, and also lacking in\nquality.  Tom Thumb's is so pitiful that Phil\nhad to slow down his delivery just so the band\ncould catch up with him in a quicksand, unsteady\ntempo.  The best song if the first set was\na still-developing Eternity.\n\nFor the second set, I would consider taking\nthree songs and using them as filler:  Terrapin,\nStella Blue and the first I Fought The Law.\nThe rest of the set is not only unforgettable,\nbut has Jerry lyric gaffes in Touch.  More\nso, the version of Corinna -- which alone is\neasily among the worst songs ever in the GD\ncatalogue -- is absolutely pitiful!! The slow\ntempos never gell, many a wrong note, and\nsounding like six people trying to figure out\na song for the first time.  To me, when\nTerrapin arrived, the GD finally did.  However,\nat that point it was too little too late.\n\nI'll give this a very generous two stars\nin terms of performance, strictly \nbecause of Terrapin, Stella and IFTL.",

      "review_text": "Klunker After having the previous night's concert cancelled I thought they would pull through with a great show for the frozen Heads, boy was I wrong.  Just like kids that got a snow day off from school the band decides to party hard with an unexpected night off and it shows the next night.  \n\nThe 1st set is short and ragged.  The 2nd set pre drums is the worst Dead I had ever seen. Jerry rumble bumble stumbles through Touch and funerals are more up beat then this Corrina.  Post drums is OK & Stella saves the set.\n\nI was sitting next to some NYC Heads who were totally bumming out about the whole weekend.  During drums they said the only thing that could save the show is a big break out.  Well they got one but instead of St. Stephen they get I Fought the Law.  A 3 minute ditty with no guitar solo?  They must have really been hung over.",

      "review_text": "My absolute worst GD experience ever Having got on the bus late (first show in '91 but I made up time in the form of hours upon hours of maxell XLIIS tapes swapped through r.m.gd) this was by far, by far, the worst experience I ever had at a GD show.  While my girlfriend at the time was enjoying Univ. of Rochester's spring break down in Porto Vallarta I made the trek west on I90 to Richfield with some friends.  We beat the storm into town during the wee hours on 3/13.  \n\nI was pumped up for my 3rd show...weather be damned!  Then we got the news of the cancellation.  At the time it seemed lame...a whole slew of us, along with the band were in town and ready to get down.  But in retrospect I can understand the safety issues behind the decision.     \n\nThe real bummer was that I was only 20 at the time so I couldn't even while away the evening at the Holidome bar.  Shit!\n\nSo the 14th arrives.  All the pent up energy from the day before has me even more fired up and ready for a show.  High expectations galore.  The parking lot was a brutal scene.  People huddled in cars to stay warm until, as some other reviewer noted the opened the doors..not a second early.  \n\nHmmm as I finally got into the show I realized that I had lost track of my pals and all of a sudden something I ate was giving my head fits!  \"It'll be alright, I'll just enjoy the show\" I said to myself.  Since I found myself alone I decided to head down to my seats...coincidentally these were among the best seats GDTS ever sent me, first row in the arena seats, Jerry side, back far enough to have a nice view of stage.  \n\nOk lights go down, band comes out, and everyone expected and got CR&S.  It was alright but not over the top.  Brown eyed women drew some cheers with the \"snowed so hard that the roof caved in\" line and then it seemed that the energy was just sucked outta the joint.  They clunked along until the end of the first set and then wrapped up with a \"go through the motions and get backstage\" Don't Ease.  \n\nSet two started out alright...I was excited for Touch...until Jerry flubbed his way through all the lyrics.  The man was just off that night...but hey who is on every night anyway?  Samson actually seemed to pick things up a bit if my memory serves, but it may not since my head was quite \"off\" by this point too.  Long way to go home...well it is what it is and it isn't a show stopper and corrina was FLAT.  Terrapin did go places but again I think the big guy botched a few lines/notes here and there.  The jam into drums was nice.  Post space was actually pretty nice.  Maybe their hangovers were finally wearing\noff.  Stella was especially sweet, and don't hold it against me, I'm a Weir fan and had a ball with Throwin'->Lovelight and IFTL was a breakout so I thought \"well that's cool\" but the show on the whole was definitely a clunker.  Maybe me and 15000 other heads went in with too high of expectations, given a cancelled gig the night before, and just like they themselves claim they always do when expectations are high (ie: woodstock) the band fell flat.  \n\nSo thats my take.  I walked outside afterwards and it hadn't gotten any warmer, my head was in a huge funk, and I'm not even going to get into the process of finding my pals, and then riding home to Rochester on back roads because I90 had been shut down due to the blizzard.  I'd trade in tha whole experience for one well played Dark Star...now where is that 2/15/73 I just downloaded;)",

The I Fought The Law was fun for about 60 seconds and then Vince kicked in with the \"fake shoot Bobby\" with his fingers which he insisted on doing for about 9 out of 10 times from this point on.\n\nVery dull and a pivotal point in realizing that Hornsby was gone for good for the most part and new Dead with Vince was just not going to click really, ever.  \n\nJerry's new \"acoustic\" sound was first noticed most on this date and continued for the remaining years.\n\nI saw 80% of the 90's shows and I really remember this night as being a feeling of emptyness in the music that re-occured more and more frequently from this spring tour 'til Chicago '95.",

I like the Touch, Terrapin, and Stella Blue specifically.  There was close to 3 feet of snow on the ground outside, and if I remember well, EVERYONE inside this show had a good time.  The GD didn't deliver an EPIC performance, but the AUD recording is fun to listen to.  People are amped!  1993 was a fantastic year.  This show isn't a great representation of that, but it's fun nonetheless, and the recording is decent.\n\nCheers!",

      "review_text": "Horrible!!! Not quite the worst show I've ever seen (that would be 3-25-86; I happened to have extremely bad luck in my 37 shows from 1981-1995) but pretty darn close.  Especially horrible given the cancellation of the previous night.  Two potentially great shows crumbled down to one dud.  Just the setlist alone tells you a lot; Long Way to Hear This is one of my least favorite songs of all time, but they played it 4 times in my last 8 shows!  When Eternity has the best jam of the night(though I thought there was a nice little jam in Corrina), you know it was bad.  At least Terrapin was well played, and Stella was gorgeous.  \n\nThey were not enough, though.  You'd think they'd reward the fans who struggled through a blizzard only to find a canceled show by playing a top ten of the year gig.  The full implications of it didn't hit me until I heard about the great setlist that went down a few days later at the Cap Center.  Sure, sure, dump the garbage on Cleveland and save the good stuff for DC, as usual.\n\nOh and all you IAGKHB types who pan people who write negative reviews:  Sorry to pierce your balloon, but that's what reviews are for - to give your honest opinion.  I was at this show.  I don't need to hear it again to know it stunk.",

We would have never made it if we didn't leave that night.\nWe stayed a the holiday inn for the 2 nights.  We were bummed the show was cancel and managed to drive to a local restaurant that night.  The power was out but they still served stuff off the grill.  Candles in the bathroom.\n  \nOne of the guys with us was studying to be a meteorologist and could not get over how close the isobars were together.\n\nNo Dead show,  lots of deadheads, and a holiday inn.   Never have I been to such a great party.  People had their VW buses but it was too cold.  Everyone was inside.  They had an indoor pool and putt-putt golf course.  People were just grabbing towels off the carts the next day.\n\nEveryone was psyched for a great show to make up for the canceled one.   No such luck.   This was honestly the worst of the 72 shows\nI attended.    It was one hell of weekend.",

It is a short tune with no guitar solo but the energy of the crowd when they broke it out was one of the highest feelings I ever had at a show! I still remember the whole place lighting up and shining copper-red. Maybe it was because the show was so bad... but everyone got a taste in the end. \nIt was a disappointing show, going through the motions mostly but with occasional glimpses of real fire : behind Bobby's theatrics in Throwing Stones, Jerry and Phil lock in to some jamming magic: Terraping; Jam out of Stella Blue sounding like the Other One.

      "review_text": "Bad, but not that bad After reading the scalding reviews, I had to hear for myself. Overall, I  really felt that the criticism was a bit exaggerated and mostly unwarranted. Careful reading tells me that almost all of the negative reviews come from folks who were there and had lofty expectations that weren't met.\nTrue, this one ain't great, but IMO it does not stand out as much worse than most of the mediocre shows of the post-Brent era.\nI was done with the Dead as far as traveling to shows by this point, but I did enough of it to know how it feels to have just made a trip that in many ways was an accomplishment only to be let down the first night. Atlanta Omni spring '90 comes to mind. First night blew after a 13 hour drive overnight and inadequate rest, the lights going down to be greeted with the opening notes of \"Touch\"-ugh!\nBut as for this show, I cherry picked a few. Sella Blue was just fantastic! Powerful, beautiful, and spellbinding! Eternity does have an interesting jam. Miracle was full of energy, a solid version. Corrina-well, they all were lame IMO, so this one is no more or less lame than any other. Throwing Stones is rollicking, actually the band seems to awake after space, a third set might have saved this one! Oh well.\nTo the letdown Heads who were there- sucks man, but with this band you always had to take the bad with the good. I believe your efforts that night made us at home proud, you carried the torch well.",

      "review_text": "More Like Long Way to Go for a Lame Show I was there. My Buddy Mike asked me if I wanted to go on a whim, and so we went. I don't remember too much but I do remember thinking the show was kinda boring. Too many new songs, Vince's tone was thin and cheesy-sounding, Bobby's tone was a little to over-driven and brittle, I felt like the Boys were just going through the motions. The first time I really noticed the onset of lameness was 3.17.92 Philly (my hometown), a legendarily lame show. Later found out Jerry had the flu, but I vividly remember, right off the bat, in the 1st set the band was super low energy, even the volume in the Spectrum was unusually low for a concert. I remember turning to my friends, \"Hey. Does something seem off with them tonight\"  I asked? \"No way, man,\" Came the reply. It was then I remembered the old saying, \"You can always tell a Deadhead, but you can't tell him much.\" Same with this show. I think a lot of heads, especially those newer to the scene, were so invested in the music and the scene that every show just had to be magic. I just remember walking around the upper level, watching everyone dancing, and just thinking this isn't \"it.\" This is weak. To each their own. Peace be with you! ",
