Please do your homework people, this is obviously a soundboard, probably the one circulated (or recirculated) around 1990 from the archive reel. Many people had this recording without the looks like rain...an obvious result of transfer to 90 minute cassette tape. I recall at the time the only way to get the set onto tape was to use a 110 mintue metal tape and chop up the song order. But get a grip, there was no microphone in 1979 that could have made this recording in the audience! Five Star show none the less (better copies exist).",

      "review_text": "Get the Incredible FOB Now Available From TMNSP !!! The FOB I've had for a year is finally availble from TMNSP site and it totally blows the SBD away! It is a MUST HAVE !!! It sounds like it's recorded dead center; fifteen rows back; four or five feet up; NO FLAWS - NONE - NADA - ZERO (except the usual cut in drumz); and complete with little or no loss of crowd between songs - only Loser's crowd applause is cut short. Wow-ee-Wow!\n\nI've had the He's Gone > Gloria > CC Rider > Jam SBD for twenty-five years.  And I know, now, why I didn't keep the rest of the show; and why I tossed The Archive download last month.  Mixed high in the SBD, Jerry sounds awful... like post '85 awful .  But this FOB is heavenly.  Jerry is mixed just a little back (as well as Bobby), and it makes all the difference.  The instruments are as crisp and clear as the SBD but, with a nice touch of reverb. Brent's \"tinkle tinkle\" is particularly prominent, which I always love.  And the crowd ambience just adds to the fun.   It almost sounds like a matrix.  But they weren't doing that till the mid '80s.   \n\nProbably one of the best AUDs is Steinthal's 7.10.81 recording from behind the stage.  At only fifteen feet from the stack, it is the Cadilac of recordings.  This one is more distant; probably twice as far...but that is still only thirty feet.   It is a shockingly good recording of an excellent, excellent show.  One of the best AUDs I've ever heard!  The Compendium lists an unspecified B- AUD source.  Well, this ain't it folks.

I remember going shopping for cassette decks and bringing this tape for testing to snooty audio stores in Boston--the sales staff--non heads -were blown away too. Nothing beats the imaging and clarity here,really adds to the power of the performance. The jam into, out, and through NFA is exceptional, Gloria jam teases and pleases. This is one you will never tire of--stream ASAP.\nThis is a standout recording of the boys doing some of their best work in 79. !!!!!!!!!!",

Is that the same source as the AUD you mention on TMNSP? If not, how do they stack up against one another?\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd1979-12-01.aud.unknown.120453.sbeok.flac16 \n(Fwiw, this AUD is OUTSTANDING!!!)\n\n^^^I sure look forward to hearing the above mentioned FOB if it blows this SBD away because this SBD is excellent. Full rich 77esque sound for sure. I noticed a couple less than positive reviews of the show itself here and among the other sources. I thought I should take the time to make sure no one is dissuaded by them. The first set is above average for Brent-79. Don't know that I'd say anything specifically shines brightly here. Althea is a nice early version. The 2nd set on the other hand is a mushes Godzilla with one toe monster. They get off to a slow start during China Cat, but they are well in order by the end of the transition to Rider, which then smokes. Looks Like Rain is good but really acts as almost a place holder here. An excellent He's Gone follows, during which the high standard of unique jamming that will come to define this show, is set. Things are already seriously cooking well before they drop into the Gloria jam which contains some great stuff. The He's Gone> Gloria Jam is altogether stellar stuff and could have easily been the highlight and not disappointed. \n\nI can't imagine what must have gone through quite a few heads when they realized the Gloria jam has just wound up leading into a mid 2nd set C.C. Rider. Confusion, alarm, frustration are a few that come to mind. Even those who had the most positive attitudes could not have possibly thought that this C.C. Rider would wind up being a one of kind piece of GD jam history, not to mention the highlight of the set. Don't make the mistake of skipping the NFA here though. Mixed in there you'll find short, but excellent, continuations of the aggressively unique jamming that had just occurred earlier in the set. The Black Peter that caps this stellar segment does not disappoint, and much like the rest of the set, stands as something of a unique version. Its got a bit more bop than you'd expect. Sugar Magnolia and Saturday Night are standard 79 fare.\n\nSound: 8.5/10\nPlaying: 8.5/10\nOverall: 8.5/10",

Phils bombs and Jerry's crazy finger playing just delight me so much. 79 is turned into a favorite year. Only negative is not a whole big roster of songs then. Too many repeats. But what the hell, this show still smokes.",
