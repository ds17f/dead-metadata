This one is the first where Jerry would bring back the \"be with you\" lyric after the monster end solo (mantra style). It wouldn't be the last, but this is the first and best version played that way. June 2nd 1995 is also a classic SOTM. 9/10/91 provides the SOTM gold standard. \n\nThis song is one of my favorites (a 90's If I Had The World To Give, if you will) and the lyrics are so deep and beautiful. This is one of those lyrics where Hunter hits home on hundreds of levels. The meaning of this song has evolved over time for me, it's been about just about everything at one point, my ex-girl friend, my newly departed father, my home. \n\nEver been surrounded by beauty and joy but would trade it all to hold hands for just a minute with your beloved? This is your tune.\n\nIn 2005, I came across <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00088101.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> Rubens, with Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse, standing on the moon, and my jaw dropped. Go see this at the Getty if you are in or near L.A. \n\nBe with you. Be with you.",

In touch with their times, but at the same time, way ahead of their time. I belive this show contains the best China Cat Rider ever - and that's saying a lot because I've heard a lot of them in my time.  It's almost magical.  Jerry must have been very close to enlightenment throughout and he's own fire in RIder, but at the same time, he is giving it his unimitatable feeling in every note.  Phil crushes Rider too.  And the vibe effect on keys adds a lot to the overall sound.  I prabably have listened to this combo 5000 times and it is still as fresh in its feeling as it was the first time - truly one of those Dead gems that you stumble onto that leave an indelible impact on you about the band's greatness.\nDownload it and be with them.\nPeace!",

Not the most transplendent and inspiring show, but worthwhile.\nA 3.5 of 5 on the Kind-o-meter.\n\nDark Star-like deconstruction during Bird Song jam - but they bungle some of the regularly occuring components.\n\nInteresting sound effects/keys following Bobby's main guitar part on China Cat. Sloppy jam/transition to Rider\n\nInteresting 2nd set. To Vince's credit - \"Space\" certainly evolved another step forward during his tenure.",

It was unforgettable.  Tis hard to write a review and Sunday's show on the 22nd was a MONSTER but this review is for the SOTM.  \n\nWho can forget the chills of that first experience hearing the fat man at his best...taking the crowd to a level of euphoric insanity.  Bending his knees, pushing his vocals to the limit, shredding the guitar, (BE WITH YOU!) what a sight to see and hear a man so chill take it up a couple of notches.  GDAMN i miss the GD.\n\nI remember the perfect sun, the stadium filled to the rim with 50K crazies, the giant sets of speakers at midfield, marshmallows melting on the turf like my (sober) 19 year old mind during his first ride on the bus.  IF ONLY I'd been born a little earlier in time I'd have caught a 100 shows.\n\nAh i recall the stupid smile on my face waking up the next morning on somebody's floor knowing the dead were playin' again.  You just KNEW sunday would be unreal.  \n\nAnd I thought The Maker in Seattle two weeks prior (JGB) was a religious experience.  \n\nTurn it up!  Thank you archive, thank you thank you",

I agree that SOTM was amazing- Jerry had a great time with this one, and it shows in the sound on this SBD.  It was my first west coast show, and well worth the trip from Colorado.  The Indigo Girls weren't bad either!!  Thanks for letting me hear this show again when I thought I wever would!  I'm just bummed I can't record it for my trips in the car!",

Who cares how short it was as long as it was right on and right on it was.. \nThis was one of the best first sets of the 90's.... \n Other ther than the standard promisedland, this set one is easily one of my all time favorites and I am the 70's 80's type...I very rarely listen to vince stuff But the Bird Song from this show is the best version I have ever heard, live or recorded.... and the Lazy River and Queen Jane are JUST as perfect....

I think the dead came on at 2 in the afternoon.  I love this China/Rider, maybe my favorite of the Vince era.  Standing On The Moon was pure church as the crowd reveled in Jerry's impassioned playing and vocals at the closing jam.  Give it a listen you will not be disappointed.  One of the best ever!  Huey Lewis joined them for Smokestack/Schoolgirl.  I Fought The Law was still new enough that it wasn't a total downer (although the vocals on this version are truly awful).  At first glance the set list may not look too impressive, but they played with precision, focus, and heart.  No \"Jerryatrics\" whatsoever!  The next night was also great, but I prefer this one.  I used to have a crisp audience tape of this show and I pretty much wore it out.  93 is definitely not my favorite year, but this show is a jewel.  Hard to believe it was almost 20 years ago.....",

I celebrated my 6th birthday during this concert, so it hold special significance for me :-) Unlike most of their other \"August 21st\" concerts (excepting the very mellow 1972 Berkley performance) this one is really fantastic. I'm especially impressed with the guitar playing here: Jerry is remarkably tight for such a late concert in the band's history. \n\nI always considered the concerts after 1991 to be weaker, but this performance clearly demonstrates that GD was still very capable of putting out a barn-burner even in the final years. \"I Fought The Law\" and Vince's strong vocals on \"Way To Go Home\" stick out for being more rare songs. Eugene must have been giving off some very positive energy levels!",

      "review_text": "Not that great I'm not a fan of this first set.  At least not this recording.  HCS is a muddle.  Jerry picks up some steam towards the end, though.  The sound finally improves during Walking Blues.  LRR is just a milquetoast, inoffensive, laid-back, easy-listening tune.  Queen Jane builds some energy for the first time.  Bird Song is a bit disappointing, though.  Vince is missing for a long stretch of it, and Bob's doing -- whatever Bob does.  It's dissonant and doesn't fit with Jerry, who's just playing standard modal lead guitar.  Promised Land is pretty standard.  \n\nChina>Rider is a good solid start to the second set, but then we get yet another \"Long Way to Hear This.\"  They were pushing it hard in 92-93, but it's just a bad song, badly sung.  Jerry tries to liven it up a bit, but when I heard this song, I just wanted it to be over quickly.  \"Long, long, long, long ...,\" yeah, ok, whatever.  \n\nNext comes Truckin'>somethin'>somethin'.  That usually meant a stretch of pretty boring music in the 90's.  Sad, because Truckin' once was a major jam vehicle.  Here, the \"somethin's\" are Schoolgirl>Smokestack.  This medley is a bit hotter than usual, though, with a guest harmonica player and with Jerry pretty well energized.  There are some definite Other One sounds just before Drums.  \n\nSadly, though, it's (Wish It Was) The Last Time out of Space.  That's followed, though, by the best song of the night.  This must have been about the time Jerry started to really go all out on SOTM, because the '92 version I heard was terrible, but this one just burns!  Not much to say about the end of the show.  ",
