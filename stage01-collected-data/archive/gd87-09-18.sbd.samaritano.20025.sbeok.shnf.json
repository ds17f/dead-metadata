The Dew is everything my fellow reviewers have claimed and more - it really is fantastic.  Everything else is tight and sweet; the perfect show for turning on a newbie or satisfying the pickiest old-time Head.  This is the only '80s show I need, the only Drums/Space I still spin on the stereo, the only Dew I'd need on a desert island, and it's got Garcia dropping espanol on yo' ass to boot.  Get it.  Now.

It's a stunning bit of vocal improvisation for Garcia, and the kind of thing that would have thrown the crowd into a frenzy.  Wish I'd been there.  A special moment.  \n\n(Note:  in the solo that follows these \"doesn't matter\" lines, instead of seguing into a long period of quietness, Garcia goes right at it.  His guitar often sounds biting and sharp, and seems to feed back quite a bit, amidst a flurry of Watchtower-like runs).",

Listening to it now does not give me chills.  This is among the first Birdsongs in which Jerry plays that chordal improv at the end... and the crowd went wild.  Shakedown and Terrapin rock.  The Dew is very good, and Garcia launches into some ripping lines with little build up, and this one stands out in a year when Dew was overplayed.  Garcia's voice has trouble hitting a lot of notes in (at least) the second set.  For truly stunning \"vocal improvisation,\" check out the Dew from 6/14/85.

GDTRFB is the best one I ever saw, Weir was coming out of his sneakers during Watchtower, The Dew is Epic, The GL > La Bamba > GL brought The House Down. Later on in their Careers Heavens Door would rightly be disparaged, however this version rips your heart out it is so Good. I didn't even touch upon the Candyman, Masterpiece, or Shakedown. so in conclusion, If you are one of those heads who likes 1980's Dead this is a must have.

      "review_text": "Thunderous To all eighties fans---One of the best shows of the decade, and probably one of the top three post coma shows. The comment about Garcia's voice cracking (at the end of the Dew) was made by one of the three main writers of deadbase and is completely wrong---I am jealous of whatever drugs he was taking. The first set is short but note for note perfect. The second set starts with the tease of the Shakedown chord during the tune up to which the crowd absolutely EXPLODES. You can dl the tune up with the mattman remaster's shakedown (it's taken from another Board) and it is well worth it--talk about goose bumps. Speaking of physical sensations, the last scream of \"I guess it doesn't matter anyway\" BEFORE the final solo provokes a catharsis of emotional abandon--the emotional content of Garcia's anguished plea combined with the crowd reaction is not to be believed. I'm from Chicago (in the city) but there is no crowd--outside of a Hampton one--that even exists in the same universe as MSG. The ending to the Dew is well documented and deserving of the legend. Garcia starts playing the la bamba in the middle of Good Lovin and then sings it wonderfully, as he did throughout that tour. Never thought you'd hear him scream \"Soy Capitan\" to an adoring crowd hugh? It was just one of those nights. It's scary to think of how many there were before Brent's passing that is. In addition, to me, it was the best Heaven's Door they ever did (Frost 5.1.88 is also stunning)--IMHO, this show went a long way in marking his return to full strength. You can fit the first set and post space on one disc if you are only allowed one post 85 CD on your person. One of those very rare modern shows that shreds front to back, and no doubt, one for the ages. I like the mattman remaster cause you feel the crowd next to you but this one is great in a more studio kind of way.\nDstone5553@aol.com",

It's like everything from the welcome back shows through the spring and summer tours, the touchhead phenonemon, Bobby's parlor trick on Letterman, culminated in these two shows in the middle of the MSG run. I understand people have other favorite versions of every tune (my other favorite versions of Dew, btw, are 12-12-73 (at the Omni, btw, for a previous reviewer :p) and 4-1-84), but it's hard to knock this b/c, simply put, it's Jerry at his 87 finest.  Guitar playing, singing, \"soul,\" it's all there.  And it's the keystone to what was a hell of a night in the Garden.  If the end-jam doesn't convince you...oh well. \n\nYeah, they busted out the La Bamba at Providence at the beginning of the tour (that was a fun night too).",

I've been looking forward to these moments for awhile now; let's party.\nThe band's had a day off to reenergize. Thirs show of five at MSG. \n1st Set: Bobby, \"Hey Rocky, watch me levitate Garcia.\" Something is scratchile mumbled back and the crowd applauds... Hmmm??? what just happened? \"Hell\" whines its way into existence. Jerry's already on his own trip; but the band's tight and in control. \"Sugaree\" is well-strung together and somewhat compelling, but isn;t an all-time version. Then again, Jerry's notes are strong and impressionable. Nice solo starting 7 in. \"Walkin\" still ain't blisterin' like it will in '89 and '90; however, for a fetus, it goes down smoothly. \"Candyman\"'s rather sadly pretty, but not one of the finest versions because it fails to haunt. \"Masterpiece\" is fine, fine, fine; hopefully optimistic. Combining the funereal tones of \"Bird\" and this nihilist play I'm reading, I'm feeling kinda low. A few clumsy yet instinctively plotted climaxes elevate this version. And that's it... :(\n\n2nd Set: Admittedly, I have reveled in the glory of this set before. Yet this is the first time I've been able to blast it-loud...loud. Anyways, the opening few beats of \"Shakedown\" are cut off; the crowd exploded upon hearing the 'boom.' Except for a lull during the third verse, we're getting down, dirty and quite funky. \nI kinda actually enjoy the crunchier/gritty/dirty AUD compared to the pristine SBD. Anyways, \"Man Smart\" is quite the breeze...top notch. The crowd is assisting the band in pulling the power out of this \"Terrapin.\" Everyone's desiring a true monster, and that's what they almost get. \"Drums/Space\" are rather intense; but is it me or are there bits cut out cause if not this is one of the shorter 'Spaces's ever. MY mid-section's wiggling as the opening riff welcomes in a \"GDTRFB.\" Yes, this version rocks... but I can name you 20 from '72 that did harder. \"Watchtower\" is a dynamic smoker, and Jerry's all over the place... but I think I  prefer the Alpine version as far as 'best of' for '87. \"Dew\" is sensitively played, tenderly sung by Jerry...the crowd applauding his efforts in desperately trying to reach those high timbres. The preceding send-off is delightfully robust. Must listen to 9 & 10 for all fans of sloppy transcendent music. A vigorous \"Good Lovin->Bamba->Lovin\" closes out the proceedings on a high note. \n\nFurther explanation of the show next week.",

How could Bobby possibly have been surprised at Jerry's \"La Bamba?!?!\"  They had already played it and was planned.  \n\nI was at MSG this night, and it was in fact great.  Whom ever reviewed this show for Deadbase, and one of the earlier posters get the Dew vocals wrong.  Jerry's voice did not crack or hit any clunkers.  He sang an improvised melodic deviation that just blew me away - it was perfect.  I've never heard him sing that line in the same way on any Dew I'd ever seen or heard, before or since.  Magnificent.\n\nAnd I can't believe I just read someone say that the 90's were some of the best years for the Dead (outside of the MSG runs in '90 and '91).  I can't listen to anything past Boston '91.  After that, the Dead really were dead.  My problem with Deadbase reviews and many on this site is that many posters rarely criticise or write a bad review.  The Dead were magnificent on some nights, and plainly sucked on others (and I saw both ends of that spectrum).\n\nAnd concerning the \"Hey Rocky, watch me levitate Garcia\" goof - it's a reference to something that they had done a few nights earlier on the Letterman show.   \n\nJboy - why don't you transpose all of Gracia's solos?

      "review_text": "The bus came by & I got on! You know how a lot of people claim that their first Dead show was the best show they ever saw? Well in my case its true, because 9/18/87 was my first Dead show! What an introduction, & who could have ever guessed how one concert could alter the course of a persons life?!\n\nAt the time I was a freshman in college, & at the last minute a half dozen friends & I decided to fly to NYC (without tickets mind you) to see the Dead play MSG. Someone's father had an empty apartment we could stay in (to tell the truth I don'tt think we had permission to stay there, but oh well, not my problem) & someone else in the group knew someone who supposedly could get us tickets, so on a wing & a prayer we bought airline tickets & flew to NYC.\n\nAfter dumping our stuff off at this unbelievably sweet pad, we cabbed it to MSG where we meet this guy (whom none of us have ever met before--turns out he's a friend of a friend's friend) who wants to sell us tickets for $25.00 each. Only one problem--the tickets he's trying to sell us are for some event held at the garden weeks ago! At that point I'm thinking that this whole thing is a scam, but this guy promises us that it's no problem, as long as we follow his instructions, which basically entails entering through this one particular entrance & saying the word to the ticket taker. Without tickets the whole trip is a bust, so we decide to give it a shot, & hesitantly hand the guy $150 & he gives us these week old tickets. As we approach the gate the guy told us to use, for reasons unknown to me, everyone else unanimously decides that I should be the one to go first, so with sweaty palms & a pounding heart I walk up to the ticket taker, hand him the ticket, say the magic word . . .  and damn if he didn't rip it in half and let me in! WOOooHOOooo!!\n\nTo be honest, up to this point I wasn't overly crazy about the Dead. I owned American Beauty & Working Man's Dead (both of which I liked) & had listened to a couple of bootlegs, but I just didn't get it & didn'tt understand why some of my friends were so fanatical about the Dead. In fact, I distinctly remember telling one of my friends that, while I was looking forward to seeing them live, I couldn't imagine liking them as much as say, Neil Young, C,S,N&Y, or Van Morrison. He just patted me on the shoulder & said \"We'll see...\"\n\nBefore discussing the show, I have to say that the energy inside the Garden was tangible--the air was simply electric with excitement & anticipation. (I hadn't eaten my Dead show tic-tacs yet, so it wasn't my imagination!)\n\nAt the time, the first set didn't light my fuse, but truth be told I was probably paying as much attention watching the mass of dancing freaks & pretty girls as I was listening to the music--it was a case of sensory overload in the truest sense of the word. In listening to the concert now, however, I'm kicking myself that I wasn't paying more attention, as the Sugaree & Candyman are both excellent, with Garcia really going for it vocally.\n\nJust before the second set started the chemicals in my bloodstream started to kick in, too--at the first few notes of Shakedown the crowd went Nuckin' Futs, & my personal metamorphosis began. In re-listening to this show (straight this time), I can't say that the first half of the second set is worthy of five stars. While I never saw a bad Terrapin, this one, while good, never really takes off & screams into the stratosphere like some did. Likewise, GDTRFB, while incredibly spirited and with great vocals, lacks the guitar work at the end to really jam it out. (For a truly smokin' GDTRFB, check out the last show I ever saw, Chapel Hill 3/24/93). FInally, is it just my imagination, or does Bobby start singing way too soon on Watchtower? \n\nThere there's the Morning Dew--what can I say that hasn't already been said? While perhaps not quite on the level as Cornell 77, it was damn well good enough for me, inasmuch as I pretty much had a religious experience & transformed into a total Deadhead virtually overnight. The La Bamba was a treat, and IMHO Knockin' an appropriate closer, especially for me, as personally I was nearing a state bordering on religious rapture.\n\nNeedless to say I didn't get a whole lot of sleep that night, but instead wandered around the streets of NYC trying to comprehend what I had just experienced--lots of questions asked but very few answers forthcoming. \n\nThe next night we did not get in, so instead I bought a bunch of tie dyed T-shirts from some tour-head, took them back to Georgia, sold them all within the week, doubled my money, & in doing so started a T-shirt business that bought my tickets & paid my way to 120+ Dead & JGB shows over the next five years. (Yea, I scammed my way into my first show, but I paid for all the rest.) As for those other bands I used to be into? Well, I still enjoy them (Van Morrison especially) but no one holds a candle to the good ol' Grateful Dead! Time of my life . . . what I would give to be able to do it all over again . . . \"Never had such a good time in my life before . . . like to have it one time more . . . one good ride from start to end--I'd like to take that ride again! Again!\"\n\nPeace ya'll, & thanks for the ride. It's been a pleasure and an honor.",

This show jams with the best of \u2018em!  When is a Madison Square Garden show not a jammin\u2019 show?  LOL  That crowd knows how to rock and inspire the band to play better (like the Hampton crowds).  You know you\u2019re in for a treat when Weir starts the show by saying, \u201cHey Rocky\u2026watch me levitate Garcia!\u201d  LOL  Pretty funny\u2026  This show smokes!  Hell in a Bucket sets the tone for this incredible night.  The band is totally on!  Just listen to Bobby\u2019s vocals and Garcia\u2019s guitar on the opener.  Amazing!  They just cruise right into Sugaree after that\u2026  Bird Song has the crowd in a mellow state frenzy with Garcia\u2019s lazy guitar playing, while setting the stage for greater things to come.  Gotta love Brent\u2019s backup vocals and keyboards on this song.\n\nThe 2nd set gets all the accolades because the 1st set is rather short.  However, every single song from this show is \u201cright-on\u201d from the beginning to the end.  Anytime you start a set with Shakedown (as in 6-30-85, Merriweather, 2nd set), the crowd gets spoiled, big-time!  By the way, the 6-30-85 Shakedown is one of the top 3 Shakedowns of all-time, IMHO.  Terrapin is off-the-hook, as always.  GDTRFB > Watchtower > Morning Dew > Good Lovin\u2019 > La Bamba > Good Lovin > Heavens Door is absolutely ridiculous!  Just sic, man\u2026  May be one of the best sequences ever for a set!  In fact, this 2nd set is easily one of the best sets of all time!\n\nThe Dew is certainly one of the best Dews from the \u201880s\u2026maybe of all time!  The same could be said for Knocking on Heavens Door.  Jerry elevates his vocals and guitar during the last 3 minutes of Dew like never before!  Absolutely breathtaking!!  Even Jerry\u2019s singing in La Bamba is impressive.  Okay, he\u2019s no Lou Diamond Phillips (the actor from the movie, La Bamba), but Phillips\u2019 air guitar ain\u2019t no Garcia or Los Lobos, either!  LOL\n\nBy the way, the video for Good Lovin\u2019 > La Bamba > Good Lovin\u2019 is on YouTube.  Check it out!  If you are a Good Lovin' freak like me, then you definitely need to check out the one from 11-1-79.  My favorite to date!

The audience wouldn't let it happen and they knew it. This by far had the best version of Morning Dew played at the venue. Many have stated that they believe it was the best Dew ever. Well I'm not going there but the way Jerry  belts out the  Guess it doesn't matter part is truly spiritual and very moving indeed. I remember everybody around me looking at each other in amazement  afterwards.  Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention like some have already that the place was bouncing up and down and even seemed to be swaying at times. Good times for sure. I also agree with some of the reviewers that this show should be released. Dave's Picks  please!!!",

It was a magical night.  For those who spent a lot of time inside MSG grooving to the boys they all were acoustically perfect, even on an off night....even if you were chilling behind the stage(especially). MSG was always one of my favorite places to see the Dead.  '87 was magic....to think that next month Garcia would invade the Lunt fontanne for 26 performances(I caught both Halloween shows:)a magical year words will never quite capture for me.",

We wanted to be mobile but security was hardcore in the aisles.  Sometime during Women Are Smarter, we finally had to seek some space & ended-up behind the stage off to Phil\u2019s side a bit.  But it was great actually\u2026. Just what we wanted after battling security & getting a bit of a downer trip going from it all.  As that set progressed it was obvious this was a special show & in hindsight maybe it was a good thing that we spent much of the show behind the stage down low cuz we could focus solely on the music instead of MSG  security constantly working on us.",

That show was definitely a life altering event..I will forever be thankful beyond words for The Grateful Dead and the community, the Dead Heads\n\ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfb8\ud83d\udc28\ud83d\ude0e\nGod Bless The Grateful Dead",

Given the amount of audio and video of the band over their decades of live performances, generations of new Dead heads will be able to dig the music more than perhaps any other musical act before, and quite possibly after!  The hardest working band, the band with the greatest command over their music, the band that played the same songs for decades but repeated nothing! \n\nI am nothing but grateful for this ethos and these recordings.
