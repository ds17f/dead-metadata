The Dark Star is very odd rhythmically and not in a good way; it feels very off. By the time they get to the Eleven (with some excessive use of the woodblock I might add) things improve but this version still has a strange energy as if it is about to careen out of control at any moment. They manage to hold things together well enough though, and it ends up being a very strong version\u2014one of the fastest I\u2019ve heard\u2014with a unique feedback ending.",

      "review_text": "Who's up for Cowbell? Going into this show I really had no preconceived notions about it other than it was only a month out from arguably the bands hottest run ever. I also anticipated a good performance due to the fact that this particular evening kicked off a three night run at the famed Avalon. What I did seem to forget however is that there were many, many sub par performances by the band in 1969 \u2013 which I think in large part had to do with the evolution of the bands sound. They seemed to be trying new things all the time as well as slowing down in general. On several occasions this show sorta reminded me of a \u201968 show, but then seemed to blast right back into full blown psychedelic bezerker mode at the drop of a hat. Classic 1969 right here, warts and all. \n\nWe start this evening\u2019s performance with a pretty uninspired Schoolgirl. Pig doesn\u2019t really do too much and Jerry really doesn\u2019t even jam out of it, it kinda just stops. Right away I found that odd. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever heard a half-ass Schoolgirl opener \u2013 apparently now I have. Rag is up next and I loved every minute of it. I\u2019m a sucker for this tune anyways, but I think this one is done extremely well. Jerry works his way in and out of this one nicely - love that little jam out. I also noticed TC doing some really annoying harpsichord type shit that was completely unnecessary. OK, so we finish the second set with Cryptical>Drums>TOO>Cryptical>Death Don\u2019t. Jerry takes this one around the first time and nothing too incredible is going on, however it sounds good. The drums is all of 16 seconds and then we drop into what I think is the most important, or interesting part of the show. TOO fires up and immediately Jerry starts doing his best Dicky Betts impression with the slidepiece. I was completely blown away by this \u2013 I mean it really works well. Close you eyes during TOO and you can hear Allman\u2019s thunder in there somewhere. Jerry drops the slidepiece pretty quickly but really takes this little skank to the moon! By the 6 minute mark this is full blown ripshit mode \u2013 dig it! Just as soon as I am really feeling this one they back right the hell off and drop right back to the reprise. WTF Jerry? Just gonna totally quit on that shit? Criminal. Anyhow, the transition into Death Don\u2019t is really pretty good and the tune is too, right up to the point where it is cut. Usually cuts don\u2019t bother me, but this one did. I wasn\u2019t ready for it and once again I was totally feelin\u2019 it \u2013 and blam. Over. Whaddya gonna do? Still sucks though. \n\nSo thoughts on this first set. Well, it had it\u2019s moments for sure, but it seemed like they are distracted or not into it or something. Also I have no idea what is going on with Pig or TC or whoever is manning the keys tonight, because they sound awful. The fills suck and chords are straight up being missed. Weird. \n\nWe start our inverted second set with a 23 minute Lovelight, which definitely seemed to drag for the last 7 minutes or so. Badly. Also, again \u2013 TC sounds fucking terrible. Why they decided to open with this Ill never know, but maybe they were trying to get some people movin\u2019 or something. All I know is that Lovelight sucks ass as a second set opener. Terrible placement, awful version. They close out the night with a Dark Star>Stephen>11>Feedback combo which was the best and worst part of the show. The Star starts off kinda like a \u201968 version, just not quite as fast. I actually really enjoyed this one quite a bit. It starts somewhat drifty but maintains that edge(that Jerry seems to be playing with all night). They slow it down to a crawl pretty damn quick, and keep it all quiet for a few minutes while they all take turns meandering around \u2013 and then Jerry busts into the first verse accompanied by the gong \u2013 thanks for that Mick. The Gong adds so much to this tune. Anyhow, Jerry starts doing some pretty interesting stuff around the ten minute mark, and that\u2019s when I start getting the feeling that this one is getting kinda trippy, dude. Interesting for sure. At first I wasn\u2019t so fond of this one, but the more I listened to it the more I liked it. Definitely spaces the fuck out and then they bring back to \u201968 mode for the last two minutes and final verse. They drift for about 30 seconds and then Jerry eeks out the first few licks of Stephen and it sounds great \u2013 until the fucking cowbell. Come on man \u2013 the fucking cowbell during Stephen \u2013 just wait for 11 man! Sounds awful and super distracting. I don\u2019t get it, at all. I will say all of the sudden TC sounds on top of his game though. This cowbell is fucking killing me. Please stop it Mickey, before I cram that thing where the sun don\u2019t shine. Uhgg\u2026From there we head straight into a very well played Eleven. Another tune I pretty much always enjoy, even if the cowbell is still audible. The weird thing is, it seems to continually pick up pace like they are rushing, and once again, right as they get going Jerry forces them into feedback to straight silence. Again, I don\u2019t get it. I think they were told to stop between the 8 and 9 minute mark of Eleven. Who knows what the hell was actually going on in that place tonight. All I know is that was one strange freakin show. \n\nI think this show had so many distracting moments that it made it difficult to review. Something was going on in the Avalon that night, and I don\u2019t mean drugs or whatever. I mean it sounds to me like they didn\u2019t even want to be there. So many times Jerry up and quit on jams \u2013 and so did Billy and Mick both. Phil sounded great and many of their jams got very heavy and involved \u2013 like Dark Star. The cowbell from the start of Stephen until the end drove me fucking bananas \u2013 and the fact that it was right next to the mic didn\u2019t help the situation one bit. The Lovelight second set opener was total dogshit, and TC sounded horrid all night. \n\nAgain, it wasn\u2019t all bad \u2013 just not that enjoyable of a listen as a whole. Certain segments were off the hook but the entire package aint that good. HUGE chop during Death Dont and Stephen dont help this one's cause either. Garners 3 stars stricly on the strength of DS and TOO.",
