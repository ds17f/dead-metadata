      "review_text": "Vive La France! The pinnicle of Dead power and great mix - can hear all instruments very clearly. Jer rips at Truckin and despite slight feedback prob, I think it's easily up there with Europe 72 version. Bob's \"wahhhh get back truckin on\" only goes one verse as I think he's too into the jam to sing anymore. Other One has Jer again turning up reverb and going off. Great to hear Kieth's piano along with Pig's organ. Billy kicks the s*** out of his kit in true jazzy form. Bobby and Phil right there with Jer's wah wah in the space jam which goes to the edge then rocks back in with bass and drums. Slight glitch at 14 minute mark in Other One, otherwise clean. Into upbeat He's Gone - great vocals from JG but no harmonies from Bob and Phil?",

      "review_text": "le Joie de vivre \"...Lille looked like an impressionist painting, cows in the distance, poplar trees in rows, with a little LSD, it wasn't hard to see why Monet and company liked the light in their native country. For Phil especially, it was one of the truly spectacular experiences of a lifetime, as though for an hour or two he lived inside a Seurat or a Cezanne.\" \nDennis McNally\n\n\nBack in France for a make up date, the band pulls off another stellar performance. Interrupted by rain, it's not quite as superlative as some of the preceeding shows, however the second set is dynamite. \n\nThe set opening performance of Truckin' is excellent, featuring some some great licks by Jerry and slashing leads from Weir. Towards the end of the instrumental break you can hear a brief, but unmistakable shot at a Nobody's Jam. \n\nThe highlight of the free concert is an excellent 28+ minute, sometimes spacey performance of The Other One. The jamming on this one is not nearly as cohesive as the performance in Paris ten days earlier. Still there is some great playing; Weir in particular contributes his trademark slashing leads throughout, and Pigpen adds some eerie organ fills that add to the mood. Following the intense meltdown segment, at about 20:40, there is a compelling movement that contains some brief hints of a Spanish Jam. This is followed by an interesting jam with Billy hammering out a drumbeat and contains some great guitar work from Bobby who comes through the right channel crystal clear. \n\nThe show ending NFA> GDTRFB, though cut, is terrific as well. Sound quality on the incomplete Ladner transfer is fine, but the partial Miller file is excellent, possibly sourced from the Taper's Section. In spite of the missing portion of the second set, this one is a little gem. (95 pts)",
