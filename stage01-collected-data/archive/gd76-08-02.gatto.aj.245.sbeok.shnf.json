What is not mentioned anywhere is the following: It was a beautiful day, and an outdoor concert scheduled for 6:00 pm. We were there early, getting sufficiently primed. And then, without warning at 3 in the afternoon, who should walk on stage but Phil. He started tuning his bass, and all of a sudden played a 10-15 minute impromptu solo of Dark Star......bass only. It was a memorable moment hours before the show started.",

They started seriously searching everyone getting in.  Everyone was passing the word back, in whatever sort of line there was.  Drugs and booze were being sent back in line in fear it would be nabbed. The music was very good quality and the boys were in top form.  Two encores, which was rare, likely a nod to Jerry's birthday.  But during the whole show the heat was heavy, busting folks around the perimeter of the show.  Afterwards the scene became a full fledged riot.  The outside chain link fence when down and the cops stormed many deadheads as they attempted to leave.  They had clubs and were dragging folks.  It looked at times, that the deadheads were 'winning', and I saw more than one cop thrown into a porta potty and turned upside down.  In the morning, the radios announced that 15 cops were taken to the hospital.  Hence, there were no more outside rock concerts at Colt park......",

Looking at the times I tried to fit them in their proper place and it should work at just under 80 minutes but it doesn't. So I decided to leave them there and take PITB to the end of disc 2. Sure, there is a break in the jam but in listening to it I thought better to have proper sequence. I also remember Dick's Picks doing that with #17. I haven't listened to this yet but once in a while a great  audience recording is fun to listen to and besides, this show made the top 100 at GDLive. I'm selecting a 4 because I must select something and I anticipate this being a great listen.",

      "review_text": "First Show Finally after having listened to the albums for 5 years I was able to get to a show. The hiatus that started in Oct. '74 was of course a big reason for the delay. I was 17 in the summer of '76\nand in those days, at that age, getting to shows in NYC or Boston was not easy from central CT. There's an added twist\nto to this that is kind of a long story. So, I'll make it brief to share the gist. Background info, J. Barlow, B Weir's lyricist went to college in Middletown CT. at Wesleyan. My Mom knew him then, she worked there. I went to show with my friends at the time and found a spot in the crowd in the sdbd area. During one of the first songs, I saw a woman walk out and sit down on the front edge on the stage near K. Godchaux. It took only a moment to realize THAT IT WAS MY MOM!!! So I immediately started making my way up towards the stage and when I got as close as I could to where she was, during Tennessee Jed, I started yelling, \"hey Mom\", obviously everybody around me thought I was quite insane, or, at least did NOT want whatever it was I must be on. But she heard me and spotted me and waved me over to the backstage gate. There she met me and I was whisked in and in a blur she walked me up onto the stage and sat me down where she had been, with the consent of Steve Brown, the stage manager at the time. Too incredulous to fully comprehend what was happening, I got to watch the rest of the first set from that spot (literally 6-8 feet from Jerry, on the front edge of the stage). For the 2nd set I had to move back a bit to a less incredible spot. Anyway, an amazing first show,\nthat was also a once in a lifetime experience.",

The crowd outside the snowfence broke the barriers down, lit some of the wooden snowfencing on fire, and threw rocks and bottles at the firemen...then the cops were called in, just as the concert was over. I remember getting a billy club to the head as we exited, even though I was part of the paying crowd. \n\nTwas the last outdoor concert in Hartford for a long, long time!\n\nAnyway, the sound quality seems pretty good here, no complaints from me.

A buddy of mine was involved in smashing the fence at the back of the \"park\" and the ensuing riot...which I was blissfully unaware of - I was up alongside the board.

I've probably listened to this recording at least 70 times.\n\nSo a couple of weeks ago I was only listening to the left channel on my headphones and @ 1:22 of Lazy Lightnin' I hear in the crowd \"Hey Brew\" I had to relisten 2 or 3 more times to be sure, but that's my brothers name... blew me away! Love to be there again, great people, never saw the riot, just a highlight of the summer. \n\nI love the AUD recordings, especially for the outdoor concerts. The clapping, the conversation, it's just like being there.  The \"Don't be an asshole!\" yelled during the first encore. Makes me feel back in the park... \n\nThanks Keith for recording and thanks Archive.org for keeping these treasures available!",

Yeah, if every recording had this type of audience chatter it would get old (man how spoiled we are to have nearly every show at our fingertips - many absolutely smoking quality).  But here I love hearing the heads just having a good old time!  Gotta say one of my favorite Might As Wells, never heard it jammed out like that!  Go GD in Hartford!\n\nBTW - no ordinary drums here, really smoking improv by the boys, at their best!",

      "review_text": "Disappointment Not intending to rain on everyone's parade, but this show captures everything that was so depressing about the band's return after their 1974-1976 hiatus: a predictable and unadventurous song selection, everything played at half-tempo, far too much Donna Godchaux, and almost no substantial jamming. Having seen great shows in 1971, 1972, and even 1974, I sat through this show bored and bewildered. \n\nBTW, I'm pretty sure the order of songs on the tape is not quite right. I think the encores were US Blues and Sugar Magnolia, for which the band made the audience beg an unearthly long time. This was a far cry from the Good Old Grateful Dead. Add to all this a pretty dark and edgy vibe at the show, including pretty rough security, and it's a memory I'd be happy to discard.",

Makes you feel like you're there. From reading the comments I'm hearing about riots, etc. I would have tried to get back in as well. Having fun listening to this on Aug 2, 2021. ",

We were all tripping our brains out I believe it was red pyramid window pane. When the riot started we were up front right hand side of the stage and we stayed away from it. I still have the full ticket\n (we jumped the fence remember?\"  Strange night I will never forget!  Tim\n                                          P.S. Rockville H.S. \"77\"\n\n             \n",

Kinda cool too, to hear their reactions to the tunes. \u201cCandyman\u201d was a hit and you can hear some guy tell his buddy \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d.\nA Dead show was not a bad Bday present back in those days, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude01",
