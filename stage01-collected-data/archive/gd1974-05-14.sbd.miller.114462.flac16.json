The first songs are weak because the band is trying to dial in their mix on stage.\n\nWall of Sound is totally intact re: recording excellence in second set. You could hear every whisper and nuance.\n\nHave had numerous discussions with John Meyer about the GD's sound systems -- especially the modern ones he's designed for the various offshoot bands. He maintains a perfectly appreciable stance that the band(s) sound better under the aegis of his systems and I would generally heartily concur, consistency wise, but to this old fart nothing compares, in person, nor on tape, to the WOS.",

A FLAC version was 'bumped' to the top of the Lossless Legs list recently, following the announcement that it was going to be the next Dave's Picks, so I grabbed a copy. I saved the FLAC to 'ye olde' external hard-drives and loaded an mp3 version @ 320 kbps onto my mp3 player with a view to giving it a thorough going over.\n\nAfter a few listens I have concluded that, although it is only a 'so so' show, the 'mix', recording, whatever is amazing. I am sure that Jeffrey Norman will work wonders when upgrading it to HDCD but most of the building blocks are already in place. If you ask me, the Charlie Miller version is already (almost) commercial release quality. Mr Norman is going to have his work cut out. I say \"almost\" because there is at least one flaw in the version on the Archive and Lossless Legs i.e. the tape-flip during \"China Doll' although Charlie Miller has 'repaired' it with an almost unnoticeable cross-fade. You can only tell because there are a couple of missing lines where the lyrics don't quite match, though the music doesn't skip a beat. No doubt the 'Deadnet' people will either have a  complete soundboard from the vault or will patch it from another performance which they have developed a nasty habit of doing recently.\n\nI say 'so so' show because the \"Dark Star\" is a bit directionless and lacks a focal point like a 'Mind Left Body', 'Feeling Groovy' or 'Tighten Up' jam. That said, there are more or less perfect renditions of all the remaining songs.\n\nOne thing also appeals to me: the way they come in 'piecemeal' during \"Bertha\". It starts with just the drums and piano and Jerry's vocals, then the rhythm guitar and bass are piped in, finally followed by Jerry's lead guitar - i.e. the 'Wall of Sound' as it was, warts and all.\n\n\"The Promised Land\" is attached as a sample (small enough to be E-mailed 'ordinary'). I'll see if I can send \"Bertha\" via Sky-Drive if I can manage it before I fall asleep.\n\nWell those are my thoughts - feel free to shoot me down.\n\nHua Hin Wharf Rat\n(AKA Tidewater 4-10-0-9)",

The jam caresses you like a lover, then stings you like a viper in the meltdown section.  Sends you to dreamland, then jars you awake in the best way.  Ending of Playin' is a bit rough; other than that it's a great listen.  WRS is starting to get a bit out there, though not nearly as much as it would later that year (6/18).  How about Jerry's sound in China Doll; is that a kazoo doubling his solo?  Sound is good though maybe slightly high in pitch. \n\nOh by the way, ignore beedup saying people who didn't attend the shows have no right to review them.  I was all of 7 years old; how was I going to attend any show in 1974?

You can\u2019t fix things forever recorded incorrectly (see Winterland Oct 74 run!). The song is mediocre.\nMAMU gets the juices mixing, probably pleased the locals too.\nLoser\nBTW sounds great, nice tempo, strong Phil work, and Jerry is subtle behind Bob\u2019s singing.\nScarlet>IMHBTR, Scarlet comes out with a great tempo and strong guitar. Keith has assumed the organ. Despite the strong tempo, there\u2019s no rush when they hit the jam segment, Jerry bides his time and jumps in at the right moment. The ensuing jam reaches places that would be common in the later years of the jam, then breaks down nicely into It Must Have Been the Roses. This is the type of segue that brought me to the GD (specifically, the 77 Barton Hall S>F). I never know if it is planned or not, but either way the musicianship in astounding. I\u2019ve grown quite found of Roses in the past year or so, though I wish Keith would have remained on the organ rather than going back to the piano.\nJack Straw\nTN Jed is about average for the period, which means enjoyable.\nMexicali\nDeal\nBig River is usually a good gauge on the energy of a set in this period, or it adds needed energy. This one seems mediocre, though it does bring a little more energy before the final two songs of the set.\nBEW starts off slowly, but gathers steam nicely.\nPITB, the jam starts off slow with Garcia going to a watery tone. Billy is all over the cymbals, Bob providing steady rhythm, but Garcia, uncommonly, doesn\u2019t seem to be there. Before the 8 minute mark Garcia remembers he\u2019s the star of the show and starts making it count, which excites Bobby into more creative rhythm work, as things get weird. Around 11 minutes the jam goes into spacier territory, only to return to a more exploratory theme based jam a minute and a half later, which I appreciate because it is more intriguing. Around 14 minutes in we appear to be headed to the jungle for a Tiger strike. No dice on the Tiger, but it is a nice jam that brings us an energetic return to the theme for the reprise.\n\nThe encore slotted US Blues takes a set opening role, which is a nice start.\nEl Paso is fun as usual, keeps things moving along nicely, another locals pleasure I\u2019m sure.\nRow Jimmy, typically not a favorite of mine, is pretty good. Poignant playing by Garcia and good support from Phil before the meat sequence is key.\nWRS>LIG>DS>China Doll\nA nice line up for the meat sequence, though this probably wanted to make beer swilling college kids in MT run for the exits. Prelude and part 1 are excellent, with a somewhat sloppy but still entertaining LIG. The segue into Dark Star was easy work for them. The journey is a slow one. After some mediocre exploratory jamming they return to the theme around 11 minutes in. After the verse it isn\u2019t long before it goes into space, the locals now drooling with their boredom. Deadheads who enjoy spaciness will enjoy it, it doesn\u2019t scatter into deep space (few notes), but instead maintains a steady sound. At the 19 minute mark Jerry again flirts with Tiger territory and he fucking unleashes the hell out of it. Locals now going through anaphylactic shock. Feedback during the short tiger takes away from it a bit. A nice jazzy jam, probably the highlight of the sequence, brings us to the song\u2019s conclusion as they segued smoothly into China Doll. For a band that is so consistently considered to have incredible interaction with their audience, it\u2019s odd they didn\u2019t take a more apt approach to the meat sequence. \nPromised Land, and the audience rejoices! \nNFA>GDTRFB\nA great NFA, which the crowd earned after the meat sequence. Nice energy, which Bobby accenting Jerry\u2019s solos well. This is actually the most sustained energy of the show. The fireworks continue in GDTRFB as the fans got their dance party!\nOMSN\n___________________________________________________________\n\nPerformance Summary\nThe first set is decent but lacks consistent energy. The Scarlet>IMHBTR is the highlight, with the PITB being typical of the period. Donna-haters beware, she\u2019s extra vocal this evening. The second set is more consistent, though the first half of Dark Star is less than thrilling. The best part of the show is probably the NFA>GDTRFB, where the patient audience was rewarded with a dance party performance brimming with juice.\n\nSound Quality\nA+ for the official release.",

I cant wait until Phil gets ripping into something good.\nMeanwhile Jerry is soloing in Scarlet and the band is sort of circling weaving in and out.\nA Garcia double shot with 'The ROSES' listen to those backing vocals.\nI can hear Jerry thinking the lyrics in his mind.\nJack Straw, Tenn Jed, Mexicali-Bobby!!! Phil singing backing vocals! Listen to Jerry play.\nA minor technical difficulty-NOTHIN 'DEAL'\nWON'T FIX...\"It would burn off both your ears\"\nBig River-FLOOD YOU BIG RIVER! \nBrown Eyed Women-One of the first Dead tunes I just absolutely lost my mind over.\nCatch the backing vocals to Jerry's strong lead.\nPhil can sing. His vocals are so key to the sound.\nI feel stupid even having to say that at this late date. But his baritone is key here.\n\"Sound of the thunder with the rain pouring down\"\nPlayin' In The Band-It never ceases to amaze me the Band would give you this huge first set and throw in a twenty minute 'Playin' to boot.\nI love hearing Bobby count off the jump.\nAnd here is what I was looking for the Phil zone.\nNeat thing about Playin it sounds like phil is heading one way and Jerry is going another.\nDonna is great! You don't like her getting down, you ain't got nothing to offer. (Diplomatic as I can be to those still wet behind the ears)\n6 minutes in:\nI hear Phil\nI certainly hear Jerry\nI am pretty sure I hear Bobby in Jerry's orbit\nBill the Drummer sounds like a marching band.\nTrying to get a fix on Keith, \nthink he is playing the organ at this point.\nThis sounds like the origins of the jam in Shakedown at certain points.\nAt 18 minutes after some heavy jamming they come back for the Playin reprise.\nI LOVE THIS BAND!\n\nSet 2\n\n U.S. Blues, El Paso, Row Jimmy, Weather Report Suite Prelude-> Weather Report Suite Part 1-> Let It Grow-> Dark Star-> China Doll, Promised Land, Not Fade Away-> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-> One More Saturday Night\n\nI would be hard pressed to put together a better fantasy second set.\nI consider the tune selection and execution from U.S. blues right thru to China Doll to be TOPS!!!\n(Everything after China Doll you can chalk up as encore material just like Dane - 73)\nHow long is winter in Montana?- long enough for a Grateful Dead concert to be 'all summer in a day'.",

      "review_text": "Loner Heads <br />This was the only time they played in Montana. In fact the only other time they played in this region was Spokane '80 - 200mi away. This used to be a hidden gem, ignored for the shows after, in Vancouver & Portland. <b>Dave's Picks 9</b> changed that, and now many know the overall show is possibly the best of the tour. Keith alternates between piano and Rhodes throughout the sets. I think this was the first tour where he brought a Roland SH-1000, but I don't hear him using it (on any of the dates, actually). Students & locals got the only Dark Star of the tour, the best Jed, the best WRS, long jams, an amazing Scarlet into Roses, etc. It does falls off just a bit in the last quarter. After some local redneck or fratboy pegged Bobby's head with a pitcher, they played one song and left Montana, never to return.\n\nFirst Set. The mix  hasn't settled at first - nor the playing. That's already forgotten by <i>Me & My Uncle</i>, where  Jer's additions are freewheelin' and fascinating. The next couple are average '74, then comes the 2nd-ever <i>Scarlet Begonias</i> and first great one. It quickly evolved away from this arrangement. <i>Must Have Been Roses</i> is the 5th-ever, but also the first good one - perhaps even the best of its original arrangement (but no solos yet). At this point they can do no wrong; particularly the <i>Tennessee Jed</i> and the <i>Deal</i>. The end of <i>Big River</i> is astonishing. Listen to Bobby, Phil and Keith all boosting Jer. After a solid <i>Brown-Eyed Women, Playin'</i> has some good parts, some lost, some Donnaskreech\u2122.\n\nSecond Set. <i>U.S. Blues</i> is the 5th-ever. Maybe not the most raucous, but smooth as poolside grease (Hey man, I blew my whistle and told you kids not to run...). The <i>Row Jimmy</i> has an average pace but is likewise a perfected version. Keith switches to Rhodes here, then back to piano during <i>Weather Report Suite</i>. This gets better and better, with the final LiG jam getting very jazz hands, until it cracks the door that lets <i>Dark Star</i> into the room, dragging its alternate universe behind like a geometrically-progressing cape. It's loose enough in form to not visit the usual touchstones of a '74, and not all of it is engaging [some is exhausting], but the Thurston/Ranaldo freak out from 18min>21min is cool. The unadorned approach goes too far on <i>China Doll</i>, which is too dry. It has a reel flip, missing ~17secs. The official release spans this with a 26sec patch from 11/9/73 (@0:57). The rest is average '74. \n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u00be stars\n\nHighlights:\nMe & My Uncle - freewheelin' adds\nScarlet Begonias - first great one, into glossy Roses\nTennessee Jed - fireworks\nDeal - piquant\nBig River - Bobby, Phil, Keith boost Jer\nU.S. Blues  - grease-smooth\nRow Jimmy - Jer maximizes song-based version\n\nSOURCES: The miller_114462 is the SBD upgrade, with improved pitch (still a tad fast from WRS > Promised Land). Complete show (except for the reel flip in China Doll) is on <b>DaP9</b>.",
