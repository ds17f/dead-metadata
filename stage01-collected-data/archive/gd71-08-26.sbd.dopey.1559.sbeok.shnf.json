But we prepared ourselves and it turned out to be good clean fun.  I remember a weird old concession stand toward the back of the field and we were closer to that than the stage. I remember at one point people started throwing ice back and forth and for a moment there was cause for concern.  I also remeber looking up at the surreal scene off to the side of the stage and behind it these elevated railroad tracks and seeing some old guys up there leaning over the rails checking out the scene below.  I thought of many things that I had never considered and I learned that the people are the show and the dead just come to facilitate for this wild interaction.  unforgettable it was.",

For 6 months the band had been playing as a quintet, and when Pig took stage breaks, they were banging it out as a quartet.  But therea re no shows for the late summer until they rehearse with Keith, so this is a turning point the end of a line up for the band.  Also I have looked through the db-tree playlists, and I do not see Hard to Handle played after this date.  Is it so?\n\nThis page link is useful.

Growing up a few subway stops from the Village had its merits!\n\nI attended High School just up the hill from Gaelic Park. When they announced that the Dead would be playing there, I wondered about the sanity of this choice. The IRT ran above ground to its last stop at 242 Street, just past the stadium. \n\nThe concert, by the way, was actually a make up for a show in July that had been rained out. \n\nWe took the faithful trainride up to the stadium and walked on in. Shockingly, the band started on time. Crowds were still pouring in as the boys launched into Bertha. Not every song was perfect, but for the  most part, the concert was great. Pig was on fire--his last show until midway through the Fall tour.\n\nIt's a shame that they retired Hard to Handle after this show. It's a shame about Blue Ron in general. Last time I got to see him was at the Academy of Music run in March of '72--the warm up for the European tour. He seemed to be subdued and had less stage time by then.\n\nBut at Gaelic, he got his due, and so did we.\n\nfour stars for the recording--the radio noise was Bobby's amp. Four and a half for the playing.\nSix for Pig, and ten for the memory.",

Sure....why not? \nWell, this started an addiction that has been with me ever since, and probably will be for the rest of my life.\nI hung outside the park with friends in 90 degree heat all afternoon. They opened the gates at 5:00. I remember The Dead started early (about 6:00) due to the threat of thunder storms. Well, it never rained, and they played till after 11:00 playing 3 sets.\nWhat a concert to be introduced to this band!!!! \nAfter all the shows I've attended over the years, I look back and feel that this is probably the last show that had that classic \"Grateful Dead Fillmore Feel\" if you know what I mean. That rustic, garage sound that when they were tight and together with a song was really awesome.\nJohnny B Goode as an encore 15 minutes after the show looked like it was going to end was awsome.\nIt was the only time I saw the band with Pigpen.",

The previous reviewers do a great job of giving some\ninsight into the scene.(Orchid Doctor-we could use your historical wisdom over at the forum-again)\n\nI can see how each generation of Deadheads are tempted to look back at what has come before. This is not the same band that would jam through a whole set without stopping via 67-70. Yet, this is also a band that is defining a sound that will come to make it the Touring band of America in the 70's, 80's and early 90's. This is also a band that lived it's prime on the road giving everything to the sound we all love & cherish. Sure Pigpen is feeling those blues but he like all the other key members of this band are working on a \"til death do us part\" basis.\n\nHighlights-Come on nay sayers this is all priceless Dead! Folks who knock a show like this fit the lyric, \"You must mean water when you get down on your knees and beg for blood\"\n\nSome things i noticed they end the Other One quickly after the second verse and then throw in some trippy harmonies for good measure. \n\nHow lubricated everyone must have been by the time the band breaks out the St. Stephen.\n\nTHis would be one for the mythical time machine.\n\n99 of 100\n-1   because I did not have the good fortune of having hippie parents to bring a then 4 year old to this show.",

Elevated subway going by every so often outside. Van Cortlandt Park nearby on one side, Riverdale on the other.\n\nWhat struck me most (I was 17) was that the band just walked out and started playing. No warm up group, no loud mouth NYC DJ to intro them, no nothin'. Where we were sitting, half way back, people just suddenly realized there was music and turned to face the stage. The band was out, plugged and playing.\n\nAll the Dead Metaphysics, the Way, the Whatever, were encapsulated in that. Just walk out on stage, plug in, and play the music.\n\nPS: As for sound quality, as a Mountain Goats fan and a long ago cassette taper of FM radio, I know that for me slick and polished is not necessarily better. In the best analog to digital conversions something is always intentionally lost. Some people claim their ears (brains?) can \"hear\" (feel?) what's missing. Well, maybe the converse is that the clicks and pops may actually ADD to the LIVE listening experience???",

Didn't go to my 1st show until '87 so the really early years are my obsession.   I can never get enough of the version of BMcG.  \nIt is so beautiful.   I also think the quality of this both on this site and on my tape is fantastic considering it's from '71.",

The only part of New York City that is connected to the North American Continent. \n\nGreat show, wonderful mix, great performance. Occasional auido cable static/short and/or hum. A bad cable rears its ugly head from time to time, sometimes too much...like on Empty Pages.\n\nWhile listening to the show you might think you have a bad cable, or your stereo system has a short, or your speakers are blown, but it's just the recording. A bad cable/cord should never be used and here is a good expample of why.",

      "review_text": "An outdoor summers night in NYC This was truly a wonderful show. Not perfect, not textbook, not pristine...but if you liked the GD being themselves...this was it. before the show Pig and Jerry were hanging out by the fence(yes an old fashioned metal fence) between the audience and the stage yacking away with us...The sun faded behind the dark sky, the trains circling the field and Jerry without glasses(not many of these shows around)just having a great old time. I clearly remember Phil starting the show by saying \"this is the last time we are going to do a show like this\" and it was as Keith joined and Pig Pen took a back seat. On this night he was clearly out front..when did you see a show in those days where he would sing two songs in a row...St Stephen also got put away after this show for a long while...They were high, healthy and seemed quite happy with the gritty Bronx tale surroundings...I tell you of my 400 or so - this was one of the most pure fun shows i attended....",

The previous reviewer said: \"St Stephen also got put away after this show for a long while.\" While kind of true, they did play St. Stephen on 10/21/71 & 10/31/71 before putting it away until 6/9/76. It surely was the last New York City St. Stephen until '76. Great show though.",

I was 17, had just gotten in the gate and as I walked across the field I saw Artie Carlisle (Whoopakee) who promptly and without warning shoved several barrels of Sunshine into my mouth. \nI truly believed that the pitifully few fragments of memory I could summon these forty one years later were all I would ever again have of that golden amorphous and immersive experience. It really seemed like a dream dreamed one afternoon long ago.\nThere were other shows, some superb, some not, but they were unquestionably a later incarnation of the band.

      "review_text": "First Review Hey Y'all. I'm new here to the group and am still getting my sea legs but I've been streaming for a lil' while. This is a real nice show. The mix seems off for stretches but I'm not a technical connoisseur and could care less because Jerry's voice is SOARING and this is the *best* rendition of Mister Charlie I've ever heard. Surprised there isn't more commentary on this show, esp amongst the Pig fans. Probably deemed inferior by the experts, but I'm wild about 1971, I love the up-vocals, so I guess I got the rage of the convert. I bumped into the Hollywood Paladium show 9 months ago and it blew my mind and gave me a new hobby that don't cost me much. My Dad was into the scene and was all over the place. It was cool to play him the Franklin and Marshall 1971 show where he had a great memories. Since we've gotten older, I really cherish this music. I've gotten to know him better and having access to this site makes me feel like I'm home and close to my people. Thank you for making this website. It's a treasure. 5 stars cause I'm feeling emotional on my first post and it's a damn fine show. Alligator Wine all around people. Sip it, it burns.",
