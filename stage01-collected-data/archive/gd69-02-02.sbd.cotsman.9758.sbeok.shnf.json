It reawakened me into what the Dead were all about. Jerry begins the show by making some snide comments about the audience and then the tension flies into some sort of otherworldly experience for the band and you are invited along for the ride. One of the best I've heard.",

Though an excellent performance this decent soundboard suffers from a very uneven and in some places poor mix. Generally, there's hardly any definition to the bottom end in the dynamic range of the rhythm section to drive what you just know is so there--it's clipped, damp--kind of impressionistic to be generous. There's a not-too-bad splice in GMLSG. The cut in The Eleven is a quick fade jussst after an excellent rave-up releasing to the bridge. Ouch. The TIFTOO Suite bites very apocalyptic & Pigpen closes the deal as usual--sweaty. Good to have if you've got a disc but maybe not to hold too dear on you hd. If you like this don't miss the Stanley Theatre shows a few days later. Great stuff & much better quality.",

I will also say that this is not the worst SBD recording I've ever heard, but the quality is lackluster and that cut at the end of the Eleven really hurts. Jerry sounds particularly awe-inspiring--his guitar solos are phenomonal; they're tight, concise and to a point and never lacking in focus like on certain occaisons. But I'd have to agree with the other reviewer; he's too high in the mix and there's very little bottom end, but that really shouldn't hinder the enjoyment of this great show. Musically, it's psychedelic rock at its best.",

      "review_text": "We're all spoiled I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Thanks to this archive and the likes of Charlie Miller, we are all spoiled. Sound quaility wise. Back in the day, when we collected tapes (cassettes), sound quality was important, but getting the performances (relatively) uncut was just as, if not more, important. And MOST important of all was getting songs not available on vinyl - like a live performance of Doin' That Rag into The Seven into Good Lovin' (into Saint Stephen into The Eleven). Of course those of you in the know, know I am refering to the amazing concert right here in New York City, on September 29, 1969 at the Cafe au Go-Go. But there are many more examples. So let's travel back in time 36 years, and then we'll leap even further back in time.\n\n      It's 1974, you're 17 years old and you've quietly entered the house. It's the wee hours of the morning, and the rest of the family are asleep. It will be several hours till you can sleep, of course, because there are still several hundred micrograms of acid swirling in your brain. So you slip on the headphones, snap in a cassette and press play...lay down in the dark...and are transported back in time. Five whole years! There's no time to whine about the poor sound quality, you're too busy marveling at the miracle of time travel!\n\n      I saw a neighbor I haven't seen in ten years the other day. \"What happened to the motorcycle?\" he asked. \"And your hair! You used to have more hair!\"\n\n      \"You lose one,\" I told him, \"and then you lose the other.\"\n\n      We are all time travelers.",

Remember, it is amazing that tapes even survive of this stuff. \n\nThat said, these performances are like liquid gold. Everything from this period is worth checking out. It was a style of playing on this tour that they were trying to nail down in order to record the rest of Live/Dead. In a few short months, they would gradually leave this style as the Workingman's Dead material started to get woven into the repertoire. \n\nBut for now, enjoy this psychedelic mayhem. Thanks to all who make these recordings available.",

      "review_text": "sound or music? Jeez\nHow can you complain about the sound quality?  I guess you weren't around when all we had was multi-generation reel to reel tapes and no dolby noise reduction.  I taped my first Dead show off the radio on April 6, 1969 in my dorm room at Stanford using a KLH briefcase FM radio/turntable unit (I believe) and my newly purchased Tandberg R-to-R tape machine and I loved the music and sound quality.  Years of listening to music on 8-tracks cartridges followed by  cassettes driving a 1968 VW van you became accustomed to hearing the music through/around/over the combined inadequacies of your automotive sound system and road noise.  Soon had better audio at home (AR3s - just rebuilt them as AR3as and love the deep bottom sound, Dual turntable, and Dyna pre-amp driving home built dual mono amplifiers)  but still loved the live sound of real music played for a crowd.  Maybe is was partly because the alternative was AM radio (gag), FM radio - good but not great, and LPs - which CAN produce amazing sound but quickly became dirty and scratched when repeatedly played by a bunch of pot-smoking hippies.  Too many CDs today produce over-etched (IMHO) highs that you never hear at a real concert, and most are overproduced pap anyway.  When have you been to a show lately where you can really here everything unless it is a string quartet.  Live sound systems are dramatically better than they were, but when they set them up they mike every piece of equipment in the drum kit, turn that up too loud, and have to turn everything else up until the wall of sound is just that - and I am not talking of the Dead's Wall of Sound.  Outdoors is better, but who can produce perfect sound outdoors for thousands of listeners.  This music is wonderful - you just need the right attitude and proper filters on your ears and brain.  Stop analyzing (why does that word start with \"anal\" - does that suggest something?) and LISTEN.",

      "review_text": "You can't go wrong with early 69 This is just your typically raging winter 69 raging psychedelia.  The Dead reached the peak of the psychedelic sound in January - April 1969, then the material got diluted with country-western and \"Americana\" some of which appeared on Workingman's Dead, American Beauty, and Skull & Roses.  You just can't go wrong in that period.  \n\nThey waste no time here, immediately delving into the harder stuff with the jump blues number, \"Good Mornin' Little Schoolgirl,\" on which Pigpen just wails on the harmonica, and then Jerry follows on his Gibson.  The rest is all close to peak 69, although Dark Star is not quite fully developed yet (best of the year to me is still the Live Dead version from 2/27).  The Eleven absolutely scorches, makes me wanna dance even though I have to throw in a quick two-step every 4th beat (it's three 3's and a 2).  What happened to the end of it, though?  For that, I have to downgrade it to 4 1/2 stars, even though the sound is perfect.  Round it up to 5.  The sound is fantastic for that period, though as usual, I wish TC were louder.  ",
