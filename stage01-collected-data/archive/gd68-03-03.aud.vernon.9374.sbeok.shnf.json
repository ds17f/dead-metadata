      "review_text": "Famous Tape This gets ***** for effort alone.  According to the Taping Compendium this tape was made by a forward thinking hippie named Steve Brown.  He used an old Uher with a cheap mike he stuck up over the crowd.  He thought it was important to document history and we should be glad he did.  \n\nThis gig is famous for the illegal shutting down of Haight St., the pictures, and this tape.  The Dead thought it was a nice sunny day so they drove a flatbead truck into the middle of the street to play an impromto free show.  How many bands have even thought about doing something like this?  There are 2 famous pictures one is from behind the band where you can see the whole street covered with people and the one of Garcia walking through the assembled crowd as if he is just a normal guy going to play his guitar.  As far as the tape, well taking into consideration the other 2 aspects I mentioned it's nice to have a document of this event.  It's mono and it's not great sonically but you get what it was like to be there this important day.",

      "review_text": "The Best Of the DEAD To me this show is part of why i came to love the Grateful Dead. As i was flipping through my book, \"Grateful Dead The Illustrated Trip\" I came across this show. Someone asked for history, and although I am not the taper or even from this generation, I would like to qoute this book. This is the passage, \"The Haight Street Free Concert -  The Grateful Dead played a lot of 'free' often spontaneous, concerts in the Haight-Ashbury years-though the term 'free' seems somehow inappropriate given the band's ethos and the general zeigeist of the time and place. This shos is remembered most fondly of all, largely because it has become regarded as the band's goodbye to the Haight, and because, after the ravages of the summer of love, magic could still happen.    The concert came about after a nasty dust-up between hippies and cops two weeks earlier. Hoping to ease the tensions, the city proclaimed a 'street festival' for March 3, with the streets of Haight closed to traffic.    It was an opportunity the band wasn't about to pass up. Playing atop a flatbed truck with the power tapped from Strait Theatre, the boys kicked off with 'Viola Lee Blues' and as the first notes crackeled, the poeple began to gather until the streets ( and stoops, and roof tops) were packed. 'Vioala' was followed by 'Smokestack Lightning' 'Turn On Your Lovelight' 'It Hurts Me Too,' and naturally 'Dancin in the street'. A good summary of the event and a great book. Enjoy your Dead brothers and sisters. By the way, to me sound quality is less of a concern then the feeling I get.",

What a great way for the Dead to leave the Haight \u2013 the gift of a free show. Of course, they never completely left the city. They continued to play a lot of San Francisco gigs throughout 1968. (The Straight Theater at Haight and Cole was torn down\u2014it\u2019s now a Goodwill store with apartments.)\n\nThe Haight was going downhill at the time, but there is another reason for the move: They were beginning to make some money. They had gigs all the time and their first album was number 1 in San Francisco. They weren\u2019t millionaires, but were comfortable, and living in the cramped house together on Ashbury had probably gotten old.\n\nWe are indeed very lucky to have this recording. But from what we have of the show, it is not as good as the shows they were playing at time, particularly the brilliant run of February shows (including 2/3, 2/14, and 2/23-24 Kings Beach Bowl, DP vol 22). Viola Lee is the best song of this show, with some nice jamming. Pigpen is great on Smokestack, but the band is a bit repetative\u2014they hadn\u2019t played it publicly in a year. (Check out Smokestack from 11-19-66!) Pigpen is also strong on Lovelight, but towards, Bob takes over from Pigpen, and it is not pretty. (Bob also did Lovelights in the late 1980\u2019.) \n\nDefinitely not a bad show, though. What as scene it must have been at Haight and Cole.",

According to the article, Steve Brown was in the Navy and was responsible for making tapes for the on-board entertainment systems of Navy ships stationed in the Pacific.  Steve, who had seen the Warlocks in Palo Alto in 1965, took a Navy Uher reel to reel and snuck it into Winterland to record Cream the night of March 2nd, 1968. (The article listed the model as a 'Uher 440', but that was probably a typo and the deck was most likely a Uher 4400.) He heard that the Dead were playing free on Haight Street the next day so he used the remaining battery power to record four songs, on a 5-inch reel at 3 & 3/4 ips. Thankfully he was there to document this historical show on, what must have been, high-end recording equipment of the time.",

Provo was closer to home, of course, but there wasn't anything happening there so we moseyed over to the city. It was a nice day -- sunny and relatively warm.\n\nWe lucked out and found an open parking space on Oak Street about three blocks away and started walking over to Haight Street. As we got closer we notice a swarming crowd gathering and before long the Dead began playing. It was a riot in the making. The place was choked with traffic. It was totally crazy but yet somewhat typical for a Sunday afternoon in the Haight, which, though on the decline, was packed every weekend.\n\nWe got within about 50 feet from stage and watched the band gyrate through most of their short set. I do not recall which song they were on we when left, but leave we did -- it got too crowded and we were not troupers. \n\nDon't really remember anything special about the music but that it was pretty much their same old same old and it was VERY loud. All things considered, this is an excellent recording. If this is from the Uher 4400 it's not too unusual. The Uher was a fine field tape recorder. What is unusual is that the taper had the nerve to take it down to Haight Street. Wow. That takes guts. The Uher is a hearty device but if you dropped it you'd be in trouble. They were hard to repair. Seems you had to just about send them back to Germany to get them fixed. Plus, they were small enough to yank out of someone's hand. That someone recorded this show on one of them is a marvel in itself and my hat is surely off to taper Steve Brown. One just didn't drag an expensive tape recorder into a crowded street in 1968. Well, at least, not without an armed cadry surrounding you.\n\nHave to tell you that the Grateful Dead playing right there for free on Haight Street near the Straight Theater was not that stellar of an event for 1968. We were not surprised by the makeshift appearance. Indeed so matter-of-fact that we did not feel especially grieved at leaving early. I certainly do now! \n\nSeems like the old saying that you don't know what you have until it's gone is more than plenty enough true. Geez, I have taken one more thing for granted. I should be forced to listening to gangsta rap as punishment.\n\nNever figured out it was an impromptu gig. In fact, I never figured it out until years later when a photograph was printed on the album cover of Live Dead. In subsequent years I have finally been clued in as to how it all came about -- complete with crossbowing Haight Street with a flatbed truck and stringing extension cords from out of people's houses.
