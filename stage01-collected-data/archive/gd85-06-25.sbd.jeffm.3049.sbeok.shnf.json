      "review_text": "B-Flat is right Gotta agree w/busted Flat on this one. I keep re-listening to this show, trying to see what everyone's raving about and I still don't get it.\n\nPerfect example is the Row Jimmy, often cited as one of the better ones. Good heavens, no. RJ is one of my top ten fave Dead tunes and here it's just butchered lyrically throughout by jerry and is generally played at a snail's pace w/no remarkable  licks until the very end w/the repeating of the 'I say Row...\" verses. Fine, if you want to judge the song by its final 3 minutes but the Dead never played this song better then they did when it debuted in the early 70's and this version just doesn't change my opinion on that.\n\nI should also say i'm not one of those 80's Dead show snobs--I saw the majority of my shows between '81 and '89 and attended many of the '85 shows as well, but fail to see how they can compare to anything from '72-'74 or '77 or even '79-'81.\n\nthis Board DOES sound excellent but the playing is choppy (BustedFlat is correct that the pristine sound reveals the flaws) and just not as smooth as many many other shows you can find on the archive. \n\nBest you can say is that there are 'moments\", like Jerry's licks in Uncle and big River, but he just about always blazes those. \n\nThe \"energy\" factor is, i admit, evident, and for that i add the extra star to make 3, but otherwise I'd really give this a 2, as I would many shows between '85 and '88 before they resurged with some amazing performances in the summer of '89 right through '91.\n\nsorry for the dissent but I gots to call 'em like I hear 'em. I'm sure i'll face some wrath but that's what makes horse races.",

      "review_text": "Hyper Cynical Critic Still Gives it 4+ I have made something of a side profession out of hard-selling obscure or under-rated Dead shows\nto very serious DeadHeads who have earned the right to air their views on the quality of a show.\nIt's something I takes a contrarian's delight in\ndoing. I also think it's a sacred duty of anyone committed to the preservation of this music to further the cause by evangelizing neglected or forgotten performances. I still stump the lonely streets at night  imploring total strangers to \ngive Richmond '84 one more listen - and after twenty years I'm getting gratifying results. People have over the years have finally thanked me\nfor tying them up in ropes while I made them listen to the Merriwether '84 Morning Dew dozens of times over.\n \n  This show is another rare beauty that should stagger the experienced aficionado. Everyone seems to agree on the energy level, but Garcia's playing is inspired, almost divine. Check out the transition into Rider, where his guitar bellows like a blazing bugle. Consider the brief, but exquisite solo in the China Doll - so masterfully understated, but speaking volumes.\n\n  The recording here is remarkably professional. Rather than revealing the flaws of the musicians,\nI think it brings to the forefront the blistering,\ncrackling intensity of their fingerwork and exploratory forays. Rare is the tape where each\nmusician can be studied in such detail! Actually,\nthe mix is somewhat evocative of Owsley's '78 philosophy.\n \n  1985 was a  problematic period for many Deadheads. It also is the year for which I have the most tapes and saw the most shows. It was a very good year then and still is.\n \n  It is pleasing to see the monolithic tendency\n to lump together shows in terms of quality by \n year, a serious misapprehension that is finally\n disappearing as our understanding of the Dead\n experience over 30 years grows. Just recently\n has a consensus grown over the many masterpieces\n of 1995, and a careful analysis of 1974 will\n reveal many songs played carelessly and wholly\n out of tune.\n\n   Finally, judging from the interplay and effort\n displayed, it certainly seems to me that the Dead\n very much enjoyed playing this show. What else \n needs to be said?",

A friend had moved to Ashtabula, OH a few months before and I flew in on the old People Express airlines - was more like Deadhead Express out of Newark that day. Bobby actually jumped on the keyboards during Sugar Magnolia. A taper had set up his equipment in our seats and we ended up in the 11th row on Jerry's side. Will never forget looking back at the crowd during both Sugar and Touch and seeing the multitudes in motion on the lawn, just dancing, dancing dancing. It was one of the magic nights when the music clearly played the band. From my first show in Madison, WI in 2/73 to my last in Philly in 9/88, this was my favorite. Maybe not the tightest hearing it now, but the Dead shows were always about that moment in time, that night, not about 22 days or years later. It all existed only for the night and was gone. But the magic memory lives forever. By the way, this setlist is slightly out of order. Touch of Grey was the encore.",

We saw the two shows at Alpine Valley that were fairly average, skipped Cincinatti (which was a mistake becasue  that was great show) and then hit this one.  I rememer Day Tripper was pretty fun although a lot of the 'heads somehow kinda bummed on the Dead for doing it. West LA and CC Rider were good, then they kinda went itno cruise control for a while - I agree the Row Jimmy was barely average.  The first set was however pretty remarkable in that we were all sure Jack Straw (which was excellent) would end the set and then Jerry kicks into a really rock'in Might As Well - definitely THE song of the night - and one of the most fun moments I had at 40+ Dead shows.

BUT, for the Heads of my region, this show was the Holy Grail.  I dispute every disparaging review written about this show.  The boys were ON.  How could they not be?  \n\nAnyhow, here's the legend of Blossom, how it got passed down to me, as a young Head, getting high at a kitchen table in Cleveland.  The older Heads (as I am now one of) always loved to burn the tales of Dead shows gone past.  This was a favorite, one they never tired of telling and one I never tired of hearing as the tape deck blasted us through two and half solid hours of classic Dead.     \n\n\nThe legendary Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio on June 25, 1985 (that's pronounced \"cuy-a-hoag-a\").  Day Tripper to open, Might as Well to close the first set.  It was the only time the Dead ever played Blossom because the hippies shut down the entire Cuyahoga Valley Recreation Area for three days- just parked their VW vans in the middle of the roads, set up tents and partied.  Eventually it took a joint cavalry of the Cleveland and Metroparks mounted police to clear them all out.  Thousands of Heads, high on mushrooms, fled into the forests and surrounding hills, turned into elves and continue to live there to this day, at least according to legend.  The Dead were never invited back.\n\nEnjoy the show.",

I got treated to a few 15+ min versions in my show-going experiences.  China>Rider is pretty solid, Drums>Space is the usual, and the later 2nd set is pretty spot on other than some weirdness in the Playin' reprise which is actually kind of fun (Bob throws in some nasty licks).  OTOH, the first set is 11 songs because they're short songs -- no jams to speak of here.\n\nBut come on, people, nothing in the 80's, except for maybe the very end of the 80's when they brought back Dark Star, compares to 72-74 in terms of deep, exploratory jamming, nor did their singing sound as good (Donna aside).  Funny how as their voices got harshed out, they insisted on singing more and jamming less.  I don't think there's a single 84-88 show that deserves more than 3 stars -- maybe the Greek Theater show in 84 with the Dark Star encore.  Maybe 9-18-87.  But that's a stretch.  I may have given a few 4 stars from sentiment.  Sure, the shows were fun to go to and nice to listen to, but for a real in depth musical experience, go back at least to early 78 or forward to 89-91.  For most of the 80's, you have to settle for the occasional kinda deep jam on a song here and there, unless the Drums>Space is your thing.",
