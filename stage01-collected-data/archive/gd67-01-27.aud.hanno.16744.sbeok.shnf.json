Compare them yourself. For those two songs, this AUD is just a different source. \nI'm a little less clear on Viola through Caution since those tunes obviously don't appear on the circulating 10/22. It's possible, though doubtful, that Viola, Cold Rain and Alligator>Caution are from 10/22, since that show is not complete.  But more likely, those four songs are from a show much later in the year, since Alligator allegedly didn't appear until Spring 1967, and certainly this 'gator sounds more developed than 5/5 or 6/18. Obviously it's from later in the year, like September/October.",

      "review_text": "Long Live Acid Casualties I initially gave this a minus star for the recording but, in fact, this is a more than adequate audience recording.  The opportunity to experience the acoustics of the Avalon Ballroom can not be trivialized.  WOW.\n\nHighlights: the entirety of the Viola Lee of course, a song that rarely if ever reached the same heights after '67 (Binghampton 1970 being one arguable exception).  The real standout, as is often the case in the pre-TC era, is the fantastic organ work by Pigpen.  Check out the laser beam at 5:00 in the New Potato!!!!!  The Alligator is blistering.  From 8:00 minutes on the band never lets go of the third rail. \n\nI am worried about the previous reviewer.  Personally, I don't hear any versions of Ripple in this recording.  But that doesn't mean that one isn't there, provided that one's mind is ready to hear it.",

      "review_text": "Like Opening A Door In Time It could be the most goddawful concert ever in terms of sound quality. Or it could be the closest thing ever in terms of seeing what a fantastic, then underground San Francisco band could do. It sounds like someone in 2008 was walking down the street in San Francisco and opened up some mysterious door and looked into the Avalon Ballroom in 1967. When this show was recorded, if this was January 27, the boys had not yet released their first album. It was still a five piece, and their inspiration Neal Cassidy was still alive. I can just see him dancing to this music like his model Dean Moriarty did with \"Old God Shearing\" in On The Road. The highlights include the gentle beginning of the show with Morning Dew with some beautiful solos from Jerry. New Potato Caboose, my all time favorite song, is a big fat version with Himalayan vocals from Weir and skyrocketing organ playing from Pig. Unfortunately, Billy's drums and Weir's guitar are low in the mix but that shouldn't matter. I was not a big fan of Cold Rain being on this list so I deleted it from my iTunes so all you have is fierce and ferocious jamming. The Viola Lee Blues is a treat especially during part of Jerry's solo when it the sound goes way down a bit and then comes back on top. Alligator has that charm of sounding really mean and then sounding beautiful. And, of course when Caution ends, you are just so much apart of the psychedelic world now that you have to sit there in silence for so long.\nThis show is kind of like the Seven Samurai in that to enjoy it to its fullest, you must only listen to it once in a huge while. I've listened to this show and thought it was the most exciting music I've ever heard and then I've listened to it the next day and thought it was crap. So, after listening it last night after almost a year, I'm deciding that that's what I'm going to do.\nOther thoughts: I love how New Potato Caboose fades out at the end.\nDo you think that random guy who opened that mysterious door after left that room?",

They were not playing New Potato Caboose, Alligator, or Caution (Do Not Step) at this time. Jerry's guitar style is far to evolved to have changed so drastically from a month earlier. \n\nAs for the show, it is good. The sound is poor, though. Yes, it's old, but there are many 1966 shows that sound better.",

      "review_text": "Lots of energy... As usual, an EARLY Dead show with nothing but raw energy and talent. The sound quality is no knock out but for it's time it's fucking amazing. Especially for early 67. (I've heard so much worse from '75 (Pink Floyd) and even an '82 (Metallica) show that were so much worse, even if they were stealth, no one said this wasn't either.) There are a few later Dead shows that are about as rough.\n\nTo those who say unlistenable, you need to hear more. (Really, there's some serious SHIT out there.)\n\nAnd to those of you who want to bitch about not being able to download soundboards... please, do all of us a favour, and shut the fuck up. You're ramblings here aren't going to do you a damn bit of good. Enjoy what you get, cause at least they give you that. If they wanted to REALLY piss us off, they could take the soundboards down entirely.

      "review_text": "Wrong Date.... As others have pointed out, this show is definitely not from January '67. They weren't doing huge Viola Lees like this so early!\n \nSome thoughts about the date: \nFirst, Morning Dew and New Potato Caboose are the same versions as on the 10/22/67 SBD. Hard to believe, but check for yourself! (Some enterprising soul could make a 'matrix' of these...)\nAlso, Kreutzmann seems to be the only drummer here (he's also the only drummer on 10/22, though Mickey Hart joined on 9/29). \nAlso, check the Alligator - it's a very long Alligator>Caution that starts with the drum intro we're familiar with; then they dive into the jam after the vocals. \nSo this has to be after the earlier Alligators which start NOT with drums, but with Jerry's guitar intro: 6/18, 8/4, 9/3, and 9/15. (And also 5/5, which I think is also misdated.) Some of these go into Caution (6/18 & 9/15), some don't (5/5, 8/4, 9/3). \nThe next Alligators we have (from a fall studio session - perhaps 10/20 - and the 11/10 show) have not only the drum intro, but also a drum solo after the vocals, now that Mickey Hart's in the band. \nSo I'd say this \"Avalon\" show must be from sometime in-between 9/15 and 11/10/67...basically late September or October. \nIt's hard to be more specific though, when we're missing so many pieces of the year, and some of the other shows we have also might be misdated.\n\nEDIT - Listening again, I hear two drummers in the Alligator>Caution. Since it doesn't yet have the drum break after the Alligator verses - BUT, after a few minutes' jamming, they do stop for a drum break while Garcia sings \"Alligator runnin' round my door\" - I'm pretty certain this is an October '67 show.\n\nThis AUD tape is also in pretty poor sound, I admit - along with the 9/15/67 AUD, another recording that was made too far from the stage - but we do get to hear what the Dead sounded like in a theater in '67, very explosive with Pigpen's swirling keyboard very dominant in the sound.",

While I had a blast and there were fantastic great moments-  9-19-90 for example.  \n\nI just cant get enough of the choppy gruesome organsmic pigpen-  Jerry really had a place in his heart for him.  Pig glued this band together.  It stuck for a long time.  Im sure pigpens death has a lot to do with the longevity of the band. You can see how that gritty trippy innovative progressive rainbow full of sound that the dead produced is evident as early as 66 and as late as 95.  \n\nemotionally connected to the dead forever... \n\nMM",

      "review_text": "- Even with the sound quality, I'd still give it a 4. Viola Lee in particular is stunning. As for the date, yeah, it's not January. Set list aside, if you know the Dead really well you'll notice that Garcia is achieving way too much overdrive on his amp for early '67. The guitar he's using is definitely a Les Paul, not the Starfire he would have to be using if it were January. The two tones are completely different. The Starfire is thin & boxy and has a vibrato arm, the LP is thick & smooth & all the vibrato is in the player's left hand, & the pickups have way more output. It also sounds like some mods have been done to the amp already, as the twang from '66 & early '67 is replaced by smooth screaminess.",

Having seen shows at the Avalon when it briefly re-opened about 10 years ago, I can imagine how cool it must have been to see the Dead there before LSD was made Federally illegal (though it was already illegal at the state level) in 1967.  The band really rips it up on every song included here.  Love Pig's organ playing and it's out front enough that you can hear it.",
