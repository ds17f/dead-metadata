Oh, and when him and Jerry are trading licks at the end of the tune, that jam really sucks - awful. It's good your paying attention\n\nI was wondering, did any of you music critics catch the expressions on their faces during this song and see the absolute blast they were having.  I thought so..too bad..it was surreal. \n\nWindowpayne, you wouldn't know good music (and its meaning) if it bit you in the ass. I recommend looking at some '84 shows - there are many more to rip apart, I think, than '83. Have at it - Just don't tell us about it. \n\nScotty Greene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrow up people...",

Lots of fun a great time!! This recording is better than any tape I have I give the recording 3 stars and the show 4.. :)",

Who made you the Thought Lord when it comes to Dead shows? What you're basically saying is \"I think highly of this show, therefore anyone who doesn't like it doesn't know what their talking about.\" Nothing like that good old reknowned Deadhead tolerance for difference, right?\n\nI think this show is okay, but nothing to right home about. The jam greenjah is soiling himself over is nothing special. Typical sloppy '83 fair, kind of a high-spirited effoirt but nothing close to an all-timer.",

Anyone who disses a show he likes \"wasn't paying attention\", \"doesn't understand good music, etc.\". He's a first degree egotistical ass clown. I know we're not supposed to trash other reviewers but this idiot continues to insult anyone who disagrees with his bloated opinions.\n\nI was at this show and thought it was decent at the time, but the tapes reveal just how sloppy it was.

      "review_text": "Stephen Stlls Cover Reading some of these other reviews, you people could not be more wrong.  Granted, the Stephen Stills cover with Stills on lead is rough and unlike what you would expect to hear from a stills song.  However, Stills is obviously overwhelmed by the Deads power and force during the song.  As the song progresses, Stills goes from singing to screaming because of the boys energy in the song.  Listen to Phils bass as it explodes out of the first chorus.  I was at this show and the previous one which was not quite as good, and I remember the energy.\n\nI believe its in the book \"playing in the Band\" where Stills is quoted as saying \"..this is the greatest garage band of all time\"  Mickey states \"..he was accustomed to a band playing their parts and here comes this fire breathing dragon down his back.\"  \n\nBy virtue of the energy displayed and the fact that Stills is completely overwhelmed by the band, this may be one of their greatest covers, not their worst.\n\nI give four stars because the sound is not great, but a five star performance.",

      "review_text": "Stills Overwhelmed? Stephen Stills, professional musician for 15+ years at this time, performer at Woodstock, on the stage for the second straight night with the Grateful Dead & overwhelmed? ARE YOU PEOPLE SERIOUS?\n\n Listen to the first night & tell me Stills is overwhelmed on Black Queen > Aiko. So suddenly he can't handle playing with the GD the following night on Love the One You're With? Give me a break....... I have read the same type of comments knocking Pete Townsend's sit-in on 3/28/81 & have watched that video & Pete adds quite alot to that show - for those with open ears & minds. I can only chalk up such anti-guest bias to some partiality to the Dead as the ONLY band in the world (a common Deadhead trait of which I was once guilty but thankfully broadened my horizens out of).\n\nAs for this show, a very fine first set - the best first sets back then were almost all in '81 & '83. The Big Railroad, I was dancing so hard that I injured my (already badly damaged) knee & had to go on the DL after the show until the epic New Haven 4/23/83 the following saturday. Let It Grow > Might As Well rounded out a nice set that also included a all too rare Dupree's & a sweet Peggy-O, which was being elevated at this time into a near set-ending biggie (very nicely might I add, compared to say '80-'81 Peggy-O''s)\n\nThe Second set, that was, as it should be, the meat of the show. I mean, have you EVER seen a great first set show where the second set falters & come out sayi \"Awesome show\"?\nI didn't think so. Me either.\n\nWell, no problem tonight. We got the expected return of Help > Slip > FRanklin's & not a soul in the place complained. Slipknot raged - totally superior to later revival versions from the post Hampton era: More edge, really incredible rythym section & Jerry STILL being Jerry back then. The Franklin's that followed was very nice too, complete with one of the worst vocal flubs by Jerry I can ever recall hearing on Franklin's EVER (all those verses to keep track of must've got pretty tough on old Jer as the years of chasing the dragon went on, lol).\n\nNext we got Women Are Smarter, not one of my favorites after 2 straight yeares of having it crammed down our throats, but thankfully not Lost > Saint AGAIN (37 times for me, good grief).\nAfter recently listening to this show, the Women really were very strong that night, perhaps the best version I can recall hearing (although researching the best WAS is hardly my Holy Grail of GD music).\n\nWe were a bit surprised when Playin' showed up next - two straight Bobby tunes, but it made perfect sense as the previous show in the same venue they had done two straight Jerry selections in  the same area of the show (China > Rider followed by Uncle John's). So, I guess Bob was getting 'equal time', even moreso after H > S > F.\n\nThis Playin, in a year of massive Playin's (at least for post-1979) can stand right up at the top of the list as the year's best (along with Saratoga 6/18). So many places visited; the usually chaotic build-up. The passage one very famous reviewer  called 'The Cathedral in the fog passage' about 5 minutes into the instrumental - check it out: Brent playing this eerie organ & Jerry chiming in. Makes me think of Bogart walking down one of those dark, dimly lit city streets in the fog.....\nThen, later, a China Doll tease, followed by a bit more madness & finally the drums.\n\nTHE space......\n\nPhil rolling the chains. I never knew that, but it's there plainly for about 4 minutes. Quite impressive. The Space keeps going, weirdness to madness & beyond at it's best. Building to intense peaks numerous times - each time we thought it would end like a normal night, but this night it keeps growing bigger, harder, more intense for TWELVE minutes, sounding like some toxic slime monster trying to escape from the New Jersey swamps & destroy Brenden Byrne Arena. Finally, the last & biggest, nastiest build-up of space occurs & things actually settle down and a song starts. What is it?\nA new brent song? (Things are hard to determine out in the aisles dancing you know).\nThe first vocals of Love the One You're with hit & let me tell you, the place exploded. You can feel the energy come right through the stereo while the song is playing about halfway through or so - true greatness.\nThe nice Wheel > Playin combo finished things off before we finally hit some of the more overplayed material, Ashes (as we called it then) and the lame set ender they'd just started, NFA, which we were all seeing for the first (but hardly the last) time. We were hardly impressed with the \"Bop Bop Bop\" ending, which was rather anti-climactic. Stills did end the actual NFA with a real nice flurish (guess he somehow got over the jitters of playing with the Almighty Grateful Dead by this point, lol). \nWe had to listen to 5 or 6 minutes of the NFA chant/clap before getting the obligatory, but ALWAYS welcome Brokedown encore.\n\nQuite a night: Waiting 67 shows to see Help > Slip > Franklin's alone. A great First Set; A Tremendously great Playin' & Stephen Stills doing Love the One You're With after the best post drums space EVER (and yes, I was at Phil's Earthquake Space on 4/18/82 & this is better; check both out & see what you think), not to mention a Wheel > Playin' Reprise. \nWhat more could we want?",

The jam in Let it Grow gets out there, and even though Jerry flubs a line in Franklin's really badly, they just cruised right through to the chorus. Like a locomotive hurtling down the track in sheer exuberation. Ane what a Slipknot! Notes flowing from Jerry's guitar fast and with purpose! The Playin' jam was great, like a lot of 83's, and even though Stills voice wasn't great, (I thought at the time that he looked pretty drunk by the way he was bobbing back and forth), Jerry, and especially Phil just take control. It was great to be there and so IN THE MOMENT! Definitely a highlight show out of the 196 I caught between 1978-95. (SPAC and the 2 Santa Fe's also being seriously noteworthy)",
