All the planning, all the packing, all the anticipation. Then you are finally there, with blankets the size of Texas, 30 feet back dead center with all your friends. Jerry is in the best mood he's ever been in, even doing a 360 at one point and grinning from ear-to-ear (was he in love, did he win at the craps table, or was it that his trusty briefcase was only ten feet away?) So after five songs, you're on a Vegas roll and have the crowd rockin' and boppin' with a nice Cassidy. This is what we've all waited for. What do you do in this magical moment? If you're Bobby, you step up to the microphone and say \"We'll be back in just a little bit.\" No Bobby, what you do is you go into a scorching 15 minute Deal closer. You don't walk off the stage for almost an hour. If there had been any audience bleed on the SB you would have heard 40,000 people all shouting \"NO!\". During the same month 21 years earlier, they played 19 songs in the first set in London. 19 songs, people, including one of the best Playin climaxes ever (5/26/72). That's more songs than they played this entire day in one set! It wasn't even that hot out. \n\nGlad I finally got that off my chest. Well, it was a pretty good show for the era, I got to meet Gary B. and the wave during the break was fun to watch from the floor. By the way, the reason the Slipknot is so long is because Jerry broke a string. That's why we get treated to an extra four minutes of Vince. Yay. \n\nMan, Jerry was happy that day. Such a fine sight to see.",

He and Jerry team up to shake the stadium at it's foundation going into that break.  Great stuff.  Otherwise, yes the Row Jimmy and the Althea are nice, yet each sounds a bit disjointed.\n\nWeir's vocal problems don't explain the short first set...Jerry was up in the rotation, so it would have been he who cut it short.\n\nAnd Jerry broke his string in the Looks Like Rain, not the Slipknot.  He actually turns his volume up as he tuned up into key.  He integrated it into the song.\n\nThere was a great vibe in the air at this show.

Different era's of the Dead have distinctly different sounds and different tunes, but the bottom line is this day the band was on....REALLY on.\nYes, bob was straining vocally, but like someone already mentioned, that almost made his effort MORE beautiful on \"Looks Like Rain\" and the scratch was welcome on a jam tune like \"the Other One\".\n\nYes, the 1st set was short, but honestly, maybe thats because the boys knew they had played pretty much perfect up to that point?\nMaybe its because they knew they wanted to put on a marathon second set?\n\nI dont know, but what i DO know is that the 1st set was stellar. The \"Touch\" opener was average at best, but this thing just gets better and better from then on.\n\"Row Jimmy\", \"Althea\", and \"Cassidy\" were all well played, and what surprises me is no one mentioning the \"Masterpiece\".\nOne word: WOW\nJerry sings along on most of the song, which makes this version THE best latter day \"Masterpiece\" and one of the best ever. Bob's scratchy voice meshes well with Jerry, who really gives it his all on this one, as opposed to many latter years \"Masterpiece\" versions that saw Jerry only come in on the final \"...someday, everything's gonna be different....\"\nThe \"Masterpiece\" told us that we were in for a special treat.\n\nAs for the second set, what can i say that hasnt already been said?\nIt was......well, it was perfect. It was truly transcendant, and this from a guy who was stone cold sober during the show. \nThe \"Franklins\" deserves mention in the \"best ever\" discussions, and the consistent peaks reached in the jams in and around \"The Other One\" are dizzying.\n\n5 star setlist, 5 star performance, 5 star sound.\nan absolute must have.\n\nps- It's cliche to hack on Vince (and his keyboard, which of course was ridiculously expensive and state of the art), but Vince too sounded great during this show, and made us say \"wow\" more than a couple times, most notably on \"Walkin Blues\" and \"Help> Slip> Franklins\".",

      "review_text": "Row That Boat, Vince Let me start by saying I was at the show...no one has mentioned the thunder storm, so that might well have been another day in the whole chain of events at that particular Silver Bowl trip that I...well...tripped through.  I also have to mention that this was my daughter's first set of Dead shows - she was seven months old, and had a blast.  (She's 16 now - long strange one, that.)\n\nI've been listening to Row Jimmy for about a week now, and I am absolutely blown away by Vince.  I've used the equalizer to kind of isolate him as best as possible in this recording, (first set's from the radio so there's not a lot of quality to separate), and it really seems he was playing a different idea than the one we Deadheads came to expect...related of course...but his treatment of the tune is simply outstanding.  In the two \"jams\" during the song, if they can be called that, he goes off exactly in the direction that I always have - it's a love song, and he throws in strings on that little \"toy piano\" of his that just bring tears to my eyes. And does he provide the flute??  Amazing stuff here.  The instrumentals in all the 100's of other versions of the song I've heard have all had a sort of reggae vibe to them, especially the later ones.  This one is SO different.  The reggae comes in at the end, but it's kind of an afterthought, or maybe a tribute, or something to bring you back down and orient you - I've found that the boys did that a lot, too.  Thank gawd.  But even during the tune-up for the song, you hear a cello doing a drone warm up.  I can't get enough of it.  Surprised no one's mentioned it yet.  Five stars fer sure, especially for a later show.  Sure wish I had a really solid memory of it :-)",

Vince launching us into a higher stratosphere that we didn't know existed.  Unconscious mind-bending keyboard work w/ Phil playing his bass off.  Healy comes round and busts Bobby for smiling on a sunny day, tweaking his words into a liquid meltdown.  Vince taking upward and onward while Jerry shreds.  Vince dominating...pushing this O1 into a dimension where there was no alternative other than to question reality.  Just as we thing we are dropping back into consciousness, Vince elects to take us back into the otherworld.  Jerry rips away as the Rhytym Devils pound away and we rainbow and explode, only to be left with a bus stop in our head space.  Healy tweaks us into never-ever land and then Vince's piano takes over as we drip into a serious Rat....\n\nAnd a powerful Rat it is.  You feel the power of the moment, as Jerry tells us a tale we all know and live.  The bridge is nothing short of sweet and spectacular.  The good lord willing...heaven on earth.  I know that the liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife....I'm living's no good!!!!  The boys nail it.  I have to stop here and point out that this maybe is some of Vince's finest playing.  He colors the canvas with beautiful brushstrokes of elegance.  Jerry's solo soars and the rest is history.  I'm sure she's been true to you.  Vince again with some strong playing leading into a Throwing>Lovelight combo...Bobby with a great effort despite his vocals clearly hanging by a thread.  Hats off to you, Bobby Ace.\n\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention some of the other highlights here in one of the finest moments of the post Brent-era Dead.  Check out the Althea in the first set.  I could write a full review of just this version, as it is one of my favorite all-time versions.  Again, Vince brings so much.  Listen to Jerry soar away on the solo.\n\nRow Jimmy is absolutely gorgeous.  Cassidy is powerful, stronger than a rat sandwich.  Help>Slip is on fire.  Lesh Philling, Bass Grate.  I will have to come back for a full review.  Until then, enjoy this hot night in Vegas...a fine example of how this band could still rip a hot one well into the mid-1990s.  Five Stars Indeed.",
