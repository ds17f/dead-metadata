Although there is no PA, the  vocals are definitely miked in the mix. Check out this photo from the show and see for yourselves:\nhttp://www.moonvalleystudio.com/vintage/vintage10.html\n\nAs for listening, good headphones are a REQUIREMENT! How else would you hear the kid telling Jerry \"I want rock-n-roll.\" Jerry responds with \"This is kind of like rock-n-roll...this next tune\" before launching into Cassidy. Lots of great stuff going on all through the show that you would certainly miss without headphones. At the end of the Ripple track, the emcee hands out certificates of appreciation, but Brent is already gone - \"Where's Brent,\" she asks and is shocked at how \"shy\" the band is. Phil responds \"Years of practice, ma'am. Years of practice!\" It's funny, too, that the band wasn't even the \"headline\" act - Santa Claus was!\n\nTo add to the provenance of this cassette tape, it was found in one of Betty's siezed storage lockers and the original CD in circulation also contains Reckoning alternate mixes found in the same box.",

Then I stumble on to this one! This is one of those rare, amazing finds that exist here at Archive.\n\nThis is the Dead playing for pure fun at a small holiday party. This is not in a big hall, but in a suburban community center in front of a small group of kids and parents and a few local fans who probably heard a wild rumor that the Dead would be at the rec center. The woman introducing the band tells the audience to quiet down because there is no sound system. She knows that they are big rock stars and knows Jerry is the lead, but is unsure of Bob's last name. The band then goes on to do a fabulous set. Very, very few of us ever saw the Dead at a venue like this! \n\nLike the Warfield/Radio City gigs, Cassidy and Bird Song are the summit of the set. Cassidy is a great done accousticly. (As Jerry says here, it's sort of like rock and roll.) And Bird Song smokes. But every song in this set is well played and well sung. Pure 5-star material.\n\nAs for the sound, this recording is better than many audience recordings that people rave about. The main audio problem is some clipping in places. The fact that there is a recording of this event at all is amazing, let alone the remarkable fact that we can download it.",

However--if you are riding in an ordinary car, or if you are listening while cooking, or while cleaning, or while mowing the lawn, or even while taking the train somewhere...it becomes really hard to hear the songs.
