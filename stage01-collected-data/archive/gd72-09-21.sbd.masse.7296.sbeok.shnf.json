First up is\n9/21/72- Philadelphia Spectrum.  This show is one of my favorite shows\never. This version of \"Dark Star->Morning Dew\" might be the best one!\n(there is a jam segment that is very unique and thrilling, and one that I\ndon't really think that I have ever heard before.) The \"Not Fade\nAway->GDTRFB->NFA\" is another delicious morsel from this power packed\nevening. Each song is well played and worthy of attention. I think the\nother major highlights are \"Sugar Magnolia\", \"Bird Song\", \"Loser\",\n\"Playing in the Band\", \"Truckin\", and \"Cumberland Blues\".\n\nAn awesome show. China Cat > Rider is also really really great. I don't think the Dark Star comes that close to 27/08/72's greatness, but it is pretty damn good overall and as Dick says there are some really unique parts of it (same with 27/08/72).",

It never ceases to amaze me that GD live tapes sound better than some current bands produced in studios and put out by big recording companies - crap that is overproduced, over processed, over compressed, over sampled, etc.....and the recording companies wonder why I do not buy music anymore. \n\nOkay off my soapbox....\n\nThe sound is incredible on this show. When I think I have heard the best show elsewhere, it's always pleasant to run across gems like this.\n\nPlaying in the band is incredible and caused my alpha/beta waves to spasm and I swear I was getting flashbacks at work listening to this. My coworkers were wondering why I had grin on my face. I'll probably get drug tested tomorrow :)\n\nHe's Gone is one of my favorites - I can really feel this one... great song to come down home to.\n\n\nDownload this and save for your future grandchildren to have ....so they can rediscover the dead, understand what it is to feel the music, and save the world.

I don't have time to try and come up with a better way of putting it except to say, that this was a special night and the band plays like the bad-ass jam masters they were.

As an aside, Keith didn't \"have to die to get her out of the band\", in fact, he actually died in a car crash sometime after leaving the band. The reasons for Keith's departure were more complex. He was getting stale on the keyboards, and doing too much smack, and supposedly he was not open to expanding his sound from the Grand piano to synthesizers and organs. Also there were allegations at the time of his departure of domestic abuse. While i agree that Donna was not always an asset to the sound, I think Keith was more at fault for their leaving the band.",

Weir is the problem, he is the one who b*t ched and whined about the soundbiards on the archive, he is a complete toolbox.  I saw the Dead over 33 times, risking my life more than once.  I have to0ns of spouindboards in my collection, and you know what - I have every album of theirs, on vinbly, on CD, on remasterered CD, I have 75% at least pf everything else they have released - the dicks picks, the road trips, the garscia series, etc.  I don't buy the releases they really chop up, which unfortunately is to many, but obviously I support this band financially several times over.  That still wasn't good enough for Weir.  Then they just bailed on the whole thing and put it in rhino's hands, an even dumber move.\n\nIn any event this is a great show from a great band at one of their peaks, and one of the small handful of Dicks Picks that is worth owning because they don't chop it up too badly, and they actually did a decent mastering job on that one, which is a,so rare for a dicks picks.",

The one thing that you don't have and never will is what the Grateful Dead was all about. From '78 up until brent passed we saw on average 43 shows a year afterbrent passed 10 a year because there was no reason to see more in fact it was pretty lame. Back to donna and keith........why did you go to shows anyway? You seem pretty geeky to me. I bet you did not see shows until vince welnick came around,which was way kool there was enough people already who had no idea why they were there. In closing this show 9/21/72 is very easily one of the top 20 shows the band ever played. There is nothing,not even 1 negative point about this show except for the fact i didn't go, i was still a little young.

After jerry breaks his string, Keith provides a vital stick save to make this jam good\n\n 2) El Paso-- I normally despise this song, but this might be not only the best version, but it made me enjoy this song for the first time EVER!\n\n3) Ramble on Rose-- This here is aming the best versions I ever heard. Jerry's vocals are clear and the band is on the mark\n\n4) Cumberland-- insanely spectacular version. My favorite version had always been the Europe 72 version, but this one is close. \n\n5) Playing in the Band-- if it weren't for that incredible version on 8/27/72, this would be #1. Full throttle progressive jazz for the 1st 6 minutes, then it gets spacey for the final 4 minutes. But that full throttle jam part is out of this world.\n\nTo conserve time/space, I will simply state that this is the best pre-hiatus 2nd set I ever heard and arguably the best ever. \n   Or as the Grateful Deads own website review proclaimed:\n   \n \"They can't all be the best, but this one might very well be\"",

      "review_text": "A year without shoulder room <br />This show sometimes appears on best show lists. Tough crowd, late '72, especially up against 9/27. In fact there are a few clunkers - but also serious heat. Notably, the second set has two serious, must-hear stretches.\n\nFirst Set. Bobby was always great on <i>Bird Song</i> in late '72, and with Jer breaking a string he and  especially Keith take it home. <i>China>Rider</i> is mostly standard, except for cool, rubbery solos. <i>Loser</i> is the first song on the set to really mark for the era. Everybody is ON and the harmonies are nailed. Billy pwns <i>Big River</i> by adding one of his trademark shuffles.<i>Ramble on Rose</i> wasn't really explored in '72 until September, and this is right where it started to really gel. This uptempo version is much like the Stanley, a few days later. <i>Playin'</i> is solid and, unlike most from the era, without much Donnaskreech\u2122.\n\nSecond Set. The middle is average to below average for '72, but not to worry - there are two serious stretches on either side. Though it's an odd first song slotting, this is a superb <i>He's Gone</i>, becoming a great ride. <i>Truckin'</i> can be the most generic of the oeuvre, unless it really pops. This one pops. <i>Black Peter</i> too. Rather than so many plodders it's uptempo enough and fitted with fine fretwork. <i>Dark Star</i> is a 37min whopper that some seem to really like, but most of it is pretty formless and searching. Parts are nice but overall it doesn't stand above a dozen other '72s I can think of (such as 3/23 or 5/18). There's an average stretch (with a trainwreck of a Sugar Mag)  until <i>Friend of the Devil</i>, which is a different, flavorful version; kush on a tray. The SBD is missing the beginning (the first 30sec on the official release are from 9/27). Jer really flies on <i>Not Fade Away>Goin' Down the Road</i>, and everybody is right there with him. Fall '72 was hot for <i>One More Saturday</i>; they played the hell out of it. This is a great example of why this song was written.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: A-\nOverall = 4 stars \n\nHighlights:\nLoser - near or at the top of the dozen from '72 \nRamble on Rose - the exact point where it got better and more fleshed out \nHe's Gone - pretty much perfect, an A+ ride\nTruckin' - wonderful tranny in and then energetic\nBlack Peter - building and not plodding version\nFriend of the Devil - rhythmically different, fresh\nNot Fade Away>GDtRFB - gets better and better\nOne More Saturday - probably as good as 5/26\n\nSOURCES: The masse SBD and the mitchell-flaschner are the same.

But this review is coming from one who adores the \"live\" aspect of live shows - and that's atmospherics.   Upon throwing in the first file into Soundforge, my initial response was \"Wow, there is absolutely NO life to this SBD.  None.  It's as lifeless and sterile as Mars or the moon.  \n\nBut being an optimist, I know there's water on Mars.  So I was hoping I could put a little extra umph into this thing, thinking there seemed to be a lot of room for additional bass and midrange to give it some depth.  And a goodly amount of reverb would help tremendously.  \n\nSo after fiddling around with the knobs and sliders for a few minutes on the first test song and rearranging the set lists as I am regularly known to do, I sat back in the chair with my feet up, and with my eyes closed, let the show come to me fresh.  And to my utter surprise, the show was 100% better.  Granted, I prefer FOB-heavy matrixes to SBDs, as a crowd maven.  But if you run in my circles, I can recommend this upload only if you have the software to soften what is probably the most sterile, lifeless board I've ever heard - and I've heard a lot of them.  BTW, I much prefer mixing the Star after Black Peter.  It's a really, really nice flow. \n\nSpeaking of flow, He's Gone > Truckin' is beautifully transitioned, very smooth - like sliding a blue point oyster.  And Feather & Doug The Dude are correct - this Star > MLB is simply gorgeous.  It's #2 in my book - right up there with 11.11.73, which is my all time favorite.  Three stars for the straight board.  4 1/2 if you have the software - it makes that much difference.  I can see why this is a DP.  There's lots of matrix potential hear if a decent (and rare) audience tape is ever found to give this some live atmospherics, and it's mixed with this board (re-engineered as I've done it). I can see a matrix of this being a solid five some day, if it isn't already a five with this Star > Dew.\n\nHmm, forget the 4 1/2 kids.  After hearing this a few more times this week, this is definitely a five - this show is just too good to give it anything less... mind you, that's with the added bass, midrange, and reverb.",

Hope he got inspired by the GD.\nLOSER is a fierce tune. must comment on Keith just adding so much light & color on Piano.\nGarcia probably heard echoes of KG when BH was sitting in.\nBig River is an under the radar flamethrower.\nI am not sure who s bringing that twang but wow is that cool. Just isolating on the various members of the band. Billy laying into those skins.Garcia's guitar work is just blazing and Weir just sparking. \nVocals are right there with the instruments.\nRamble On Rose- Great set-list\nAces back to back!!!\nIt seems to me that much of the Dead Air has been edited out of this recording. Which is a good thing as far as getting the full effect of the music building to crescendo after crescendo.\nCUMBERLAND comes in over 6 minutes pretty impressive indeed and this is the full tilt version.\nRemember when they used to break this out with Brent and some of his rockers?\nThis is mighty fine. Back in the day my knees got up around my head and my fingers knuckle dragged across the floor dancin to this tune.\nPITB-only knock on 72 is they completely underutilized Donna Jean. It might be fashionable to knock on her nowadays but her harmonies helped smooth out some of the rougher edges the band could find themselves in. If there is one song that conveys the essence of the sound it would be BOX of Rain. Toward the end of the tune there is a make or break section that they have to make a tricky quick transition on and when they nail it they just ride the harmonies home but if they screw it up then it is pretty jarring. Although Garcia somehow always manages to create a bridge \nbut I think that is what they meant by 'without a net'\nYou got a 17 minutes PITB and 37 minutes plus of Dark Star.\nThe jam about 30 minutes into the STAR is GD creativity at its absolute best somewhere between GDTRFB and The yet to be invented Wheel",
