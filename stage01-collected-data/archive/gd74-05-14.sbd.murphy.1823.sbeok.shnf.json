Oops!\n\nI fell in love with this one about 10 years ago after taping the WRS > Let It Grow > Dark Star> China Doll from Dead Hour. It was one of those shows to not only listen to but to cherish every minute of beauty played that night. At the time I was unfamiliar with 74 and just thought it was some pretty cool s&!t. Now years later I know they were definately on to something the entire year, playing with a sound that they had never and would never play again. Its something special to realize that you are turned onto a band that can blow away each person differently for every year or even tour because they were just sooo ON with what they were doing musically as a band! \nAnyway, back to the recording The WRS through China Doll is amazing with some amazing music but don't forget the other higfhlights. Solid Playing and a nice tight Scarlet. Roses sounds nice and fresh and Jimmy is pretty smooth.\nSound is really good. It takes a while to warm up(BErtha kinda drags sound-wise) but Jerry is up in the mix through the show! Keith rocks and Phil is Phil! Solid as usual. \nThis is definately one to get! What used to be an underated show (and still may be) from a great year! Don't pass this one up! Your collection of shows from May- June 74, or the whole year,  won't be complete without it!",

The standout of this show is obviously the WRS>Dark Star>China Doll. Definately one of the better executed WRS's around. The Dark Star quietly noodles around out there somewhere, until Garcia scalps you and puts your brains in a blender, and then calms you down with a really fine China Doll. I read a comment by Garcia, referring to the fact that the Dark Stars had gotten so disjointed and weird that you couldn't relate to them at all. This one may qualify, but I still like it. Not quite a 5 for me though.",

If you're like me, and have listened to the month of June a few too many times in close proximity, May is the perfect place to turn until you've put enough distance from June and want the same flavor.  July contains the pinnacle '74 night, August is the most hardcore '74 (in terms of aggression), September is surprisingly perhaps the most exotic, and Winterland October is a mellow journey through unexpected and pretty delights.",

El Paso is great, you get the idea about DS, it is a excellent version, with it being more of a floating space journey and the transition into China Doll is noteworthy. The rest of the set is balls to the walls good ole GD,again that X factor is pervasive with each song flowing with confidence and ambiance, NFA is one of the better ones.Keith's playing on the Moog is impressive and creative too.",

      "review_text": "Too intense to give less than a 5, ... ... despite the sloppiness.  Playin' gets WAY out there.  Especially, after the slow section where the drums cut out, there's a period of sheer sweetness where the spaceship Dead is in full flight.  Unfortunately, the reprise proves a bumpy landing.  Jerry slips back into the theme without going through the usual sequence, which would be fine, but the band doesn't catch on.  Donna, meanwhile, is following Jerry, and comes in early, realizes it and stays on the A, then cuts off and comes in again, so we get TWO Donna howls instead of one.  Ugh.  But the sheer quality of the Playin' demands multiple hearings.\n\nEven more so for the Dark Star.  There are no flubs here, but utter perfection throughout the jam leading up to the verse.  It modulates briefly into a minor or maybe Dorian mode before returning to the theme for the verse.  then they quickly go into space, and Jerry starts what seems like a mellow, reflective stretch of meltdown playing.  But then he suddenly explodes into shrieking chaos!  It's mindblowing to here recorded.  It must have been terrifying live.  Finally, after they settle down, there is more spacey, avant-jazz playing, where you have no idea how it will resolve itself but all of a sudden, what's this, a song?  It's China Doll!  Such a quick, yet smooth transition.  They could do a few quick songs to end the show, but Jerry throws in some serious wailage on a NFA>GDTRFB jam just because. \n\nThere's some solid playing on Scarlet and WRS, which segues nicely into Dark Star, but the Playin', Dark Star, and Not Fade are where it's at.",

I wanted to see if there was any info to back this up on microfilm and this is what I found.  Hope this dispels any myths.  One problem with the article is that it mentions the Dead played \"Mama Tried\" and that was not on the evenings set list.\n\nMissoulian Tuesday, May 14th 1974\n-----------Around Missoula-----------\n'Grateful Dead' at U Tonight; Bonanno Lecture Set May 21\t\n\nBecause of a rock concert by \u201cThe Grateful Dead\u201d at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Harry Adams Field House at the University of Montana, a free public lecture on prison reform by Bill Bonanno has been postponed by the Program Council of the Associated Students of UM until Tuesday, May 21.\n\tAdmission to Tuesday\u2019s rock concert by \u201cThe Grateful Dead\u201d will be $6.  Doors to the Adams Field House will open at 5 Tuesday afternoon.  The concert is also sponsored by ASUM Program Council.\n\nGrateful Dead Are on New Musical Paths\nMissoulian Music Review Thursday, May 16th 1974 \nBy Steve Shirley\nMissoulian Staff Writer\n\n\tMembers of the Grateful Dead emerged in the early days of Haight Ashbury flower-power-dom, playing together first as a jug band and later as the band that supplied the ultimate acid-rock to a new audience with new tastes.\n\tSince then, they have set out on the musical paths of country, rock , blues and jazz, creating a niche all their own in the music world.  \n\tSeven thousand Dead admirers filled the University of Montana Field House Tuesday night, expecting to witness an important part of the music of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s.  They weren\u2019t betrayed.\n\tUnlike most rock bands that perform as concerts a 90-minute blast of amplified sound, the Dead began slowly and methodically, flowing through \u201cBertha,\u201d \u201cMama Tried,\u201d and \u201cDeal.\u201d  Each song built on the energy of its predecessor.\n\tThe energy did not come out as wildly driving music, but was there in the smooth exactness of Jerry Garcia\u2019s lead guitar and Bob Weir\u2019s innovative rhythm guitar riffs.  All the Dead, including Garcia, Weir, bassist Phil Lesh, pianist Keith Godchaux, singer Donna Godchaux and Drummer Bill Kreutzman, came throught the phenomenal 480-speaker system individually distinctive, but wedded into a sound that is the Grateful Dead.  \n\tThe wall of speakers, which cost about $35,000 to put together, made the music loud, but not a blare.  It is the most innovative and experimental system in the world.  Each of the five band members has an individual sound system tied into the whole. \n\tBut the musicians were the important ingredient, and Garcia is one of the best musicians there is.  He nonchalantly stood onstage, bracing himself on one leg as the other rose and fell with the tempo of the music.  Garcia was at his peak in the half-hour \u201cPlaying in the Band\u201d jam, when he took a foray into rock, jazz and finally an electronic neverness that left the crowd spellbound.\n\tWeir was outstanding as a country crooner in Marty Robbins\u2019 \u201cEl Paso,\u201d in \u201cMama Tried\u201d and the encore, \u201cOne More Saturday Night.\u201d  Of course, Garcia\u2019s familiar high-pitched vocals were there to compliment Weir\u2019s and Donna Godchaux\u2019s voice, while unsure at times, harmonized beautifully with Weir and Garcia.\n\tBut the night was not all roses.  One incoherent jam in the four-hour concert rambled on for 40 minutes.  \n\tAfter the Dead left the stage from their second set, the crowd roared one of the loudest and longest ovations given to a band performing in Missoula.  Several minutes later, as the Dead stepped back on stage, Weir was struck on the head by a plastic pitcher that flew from the crowd below him.\n\t\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d he said gruffly.\n\tIt was a distasteful conclusion to a fine performance.",

Luckily it didn't hurt him - but it freaked him out enough, that the band didn't play much longer - which was a real bummer, because we were counting on them playing long into the night. Those of us in the front rows were having altogether a different experience.

The Dark Star is technically the best of the year, though it's hard to match the 10-18 intensity where you get the feeling that Jerry is thinking, \"this may be the last time I ever play this song with these guys.\" \n\nThis is just a happy show - you'll know that they were having a great time on stage.",
