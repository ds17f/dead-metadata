Although I had a very unfortunate personal mishap, from instead of doing what my own sence told me giving in to the miscalculation of someone less experienced, yet I don't hold it against him; the band was great ! I saw them when they played in '79, but were forced to move to McNichols, however this time we all hung in there bravely.\n     In contrast to what others have said, I recall plenty of folks looking for tickets. And/or trying to smuggle themselves in some cases, up the hill in the trunk or whatever of another's, (w/ tics) vehicle, past the cops checkpoints at the bottom. Despite my not following my own good judgement; I felt thankful I came with tickets, boots, a jacket, and cash enough to get back to L.A. and school in Santa Barbara !",

Awesome Let It Grow and a great jangly sound (Bob & Brent's piano)throughout. I haven't heard this source yet, but its a great show.\nAddition:\nNow that I've heard the source, it is the one I had on tape for 20 yrs. I prefer it to others I've heard, but that could be my familiarity with its sound. The First set starts a little rough, both in sound and in the tapers threatening each other, its funny. I never had the audience copy of the first set, just a dropout infested soundboard copy.\nGreat first set and the jam after drums is excellent, with hints of St. Stephen that I didn't pick up on while in attendance. And what could be more fun than razzing Bobby for forgetting the words to Truckin. I wish whoever edited this had left the comment by Bobby during the pause before Althea, \"This is the annual Red Rocks rain out....except we're still here.\" You can imagine the response that got, all missing:( \nAgain, a great show with a little different sound. One of my favorites.",

But there are teases and then there are really fucking evil teases (I mean that in a good way).  As they came out of space and just before NFA the boys play around with Stephen for about a minute.  Listen to it.  I was not alone when I started freaking out and jumping around.  Half of Red Rocks (the back \u00c3\u00c2\u00bd ) was a blaze at the thought.   There was Stephen in the jam the previous night and we all discussed it.  Then to play around the edges that close\u00c3\u00c2 they almost fell into it.

All of the long strange trip capped off w/ the most life-like St Stephen tease of all time... it was all just a dream we dreamed one afternoon.  (how could one have been there and not picked up on it?...the place was going nuts and the whole band had the biggest sh--eating grins you'll ever see until JG literally turned his back and transitioned to Not Fade Away;  incidentally, when he turned to face the crowd again, he was screaming at the top of his weary lungs, \"I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be!  You're gonna give your love to me!  I'm gonna love you night and day!  You know our love will not fade away\".  The poignancy of the the moment was inescapable...and no matter how cynically you can view a mushroomed-out crowd listening to a multi-million dollar musical entity, there was a close band-relating-to-fans, fans-embracing-artists relationship there.  Our love will not fade away.)  The show had incredible flow - even the ordinary was extraordinary - note the bluesy down-home feel of He's Gone prior to the break.  It all worked for the band that night, and that all works for me.",

LET IT GROW = UNREAL How many 10 song first sets have you ever seen chock full of so many banging long tunes like Shakedown, Big RR***, ***TLEO+, and they could have closed this set with Deal and no one would have noticed but it follows a slamming Lazy lightning>Supp. Listen to Jer's rifs on Big RR and a rare set II Let it Grow (which gets my vote as one of the 3 best of the 80's along with Binghampton the following year). Bobby is awesome in NFA and Black Peter is not a let down they actually pull that out at some of the best shows I have ever seen or heard.\n\nMy only objection to this is the colorful chat that the tape opens with about levels what a pain in the ass it was people stepping on cables, screaming into mikes, etc. I also think this may be their first foray out judging by what they say....\n\nLastly rain has always been a really positive omen for shows (really) check out Merriwether from the next year 6/20/83 it pissed and they ripped the cover off the ball (here it's 4 stars and easily one of the best of the 70+ I have seen).",

We were 2d row dead center this nite. It started raining in the middle of the day and the rain continued all the way through the first set, complete with thunder and lightning. The crew had to continuosly squeegee the stage. Bobby says \"Don't be surprised if you see us go up in a shower of sparks\" at one point. But these shows were rain or shine. They were not going to have a repeat of '79 where they cancelled the 2d and 3rd nites and moved them indoors. They were hell bent on playing right through the deluge. After a smoking hot first set - from Shakedown through Lazy/Supp/Deal - oh yeah, there was a lot of trippin going down all around us - Bobby announced, \"We're gonna make a phone call and see if we can get this rain to stop\" or something to that effect. \nIt stopped raining during the set break and steam and fog rolled into the amphitheatre. If you have ever seen U2 Live At Red Rocks - filmed the next summer from there- you will have an idea of what it looked like inside the amphitheatre and the smokin' hot 2d set began. I never heard a hotter or tighter Women Are Smarter and to open the set was refreshing. A very good Althea followed. Then came the onslaught - Let It Grow - a rarity in that portion of the show in those days - was played at a super uptempo pace and Jerry - who was so on for these 3 nites - totally nailed it. The crowd went nuts during the post-lyric key of D instrumental jam. Listen to Jerry wail and cry out in a fury of passion. Our minds were already blown for the nite right then and there. The post-drums portion of the show picked up the same intensity - starting with the St. Stephen tease out of space (it really was just a Not Fade Away intro but the same E/D/A chord progression as St. Stephen made everyone hysterical with hope!)into the tightest Not Fade Away - fully played out with 3 verses and ending jam. The show ended with one of the most on fire Sugar Mags of all time - with Bobby really going for it - spitting all over us up front. Hell we were already soaked from 8 straight hours of rain at that point - we were happy to receive it. This show is very underrated and a memorable experience for all the reasons I laid out in this recount. If you were there, you know what I mean!\nNot a bad recall from 28 years ago!",

Camped in Iowa on the way (flooding and strange trips - don't ask) and arrived in CO fired up.  Our friends - JonnyP and JPotts - we were excited to hang with you and experience these awesome shows.  But THIS night, July 28, was the Apex - perhaps of my entire journey on the bus.  Up super close (3rd row center or something like that) - pouring rain the entire first set (\"if your see us disappear in a shower of sparks\") - then the sublime second set.  Can't describe it much better than JonnyP - it was mystical.  Althea - wait what?  Let it Grow - wait what? - another reviewer described as \"world-ending\"?   Yes, it was all that.  I was never the same after this show - fully committed to the bus and will always celebrate July 28 as one of my holidays!",

Ive been listening to GD since 85, 1st show was Alpine 89 but for whatever reason I've never given these Early Brent years much attention until recently and wow!!, what a gold mine!  \nFor the last couple of weeks I have been hooked on TLEO's from this era and have been going through and listening closely to each TLEO from 80-84...and when I say closely I mean with headphones at decent 8/10 volume, stopping and relistening to certain sections and licks over and over again while trying to learn how Jerry plays some of them on guitar. Last night I was alone in my basement sober as a judge and a couple of hours into 1982 when I came across this TLEO from Red Rocks 7/28/82 and something very unexpected happened. I have never had a piece of music make me laugh so hard in my entire life! Truth be told I was not aware that this level of humor could be delivered through music alone. I'm not sure what it is but Jerry's solo on this one literally had me in stitches laughing histerically...tears in my eyes for the entire 2nd solo :)  I don't know if it was just my mood, or if it was set up by the 5 or 6 versions I listened to leading up to it, but something really struck me as hilarious! I have to think Jer was in a pretty goofy mischievous mood for this delightful little gem. Give it a listen and let me know if you hear it the same way, or iam I just losing it :))  Only Jerry and his ability to connect emotionally with the human spirit through music could pull something like this off!!  I love you nineteen eighty-two!",

      "review_text": "Rain!! Good thing I saved my yellow 5 dollar rain parka that they sold inside the venue. It came in handy the next year at Merriweather. We taped this, but it poured so hard in the second set it got the D5 wet and needed service after that.\nThe highlight for me (besides the green pyramid gels)  was Let It Grow. This is when it was absolutely pouring. Bobby sang the verse \u201clisten to the thunder shout..\u201d on the third \u201cI am\u201d a bolt of lightning appeared in the short distance behind the stage. The crowd reacted, great special effect.",
