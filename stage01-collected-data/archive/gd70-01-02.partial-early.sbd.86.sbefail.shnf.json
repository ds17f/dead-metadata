Were Tom Constanten and Micky Hart with this band at this time? I am trying to get an ear for the difference between Pig Pen's Organ and Tom Constanten's playing.

Though there is a cut in St. Stephen, I really don't care--there is no jamming lost here. The Eleven is great, but the Lovelight especially RAGES. Get this show now.",

Also T.C. playing in the William Tell Bridge.\nSomeone mentioned what sounds vaguely like the Franklin's Tower chord progression in the post-space jam... I hear that, and not long after, a Cosmic Charlie tease that no-one has mentioned.  Can't say it's the best St. Stephen ever (no real jam), BUT the 11 is the best in ages!  Haven't heard one with this much enthusiasm since Sep of 69 (I'm listening to all the shows in order).

I'm not very familliar with pre-1972 Dead so much so hearing this was a revelation. From around the 23:00 on is some of the most beautiful and melodic playing from Jerry I've ever heard - even more shocking it's from such an older show!",

      "review_text": "The Jams  This certainly is one of the greatest Dark .Stars ever imho.\n\nI always thought the height of the song was reached in early 1970 in these epic half hour versions through February at the Filmour East. \n\nThe jams that begin developing at the 19 minute mark are first, at around 23:30, is The 59th St Bridge Jam or 'Feelin Groovy Jam' from the Simon and Garfunkel song. Certainly the greatest and clearest example of this theme comes on 2/13/70.......\n........... at 26:20, the band shifts into a jam they would soon stop doing in Dark Star but would become a staple in 1970 versions of Dancin in the Streets, a piece called 'The Tighten Up Jam', from a 1968 song of the same name (naturally)... Some have debated that it is actually Chicago's 'Beginnings' and this is probably as clear an example of their argument being correct as I have ever heard - they're basically playing the opening of that song here..I'd like to note however that most other times I have heard it and noted it, it sounds like Tighten Up to me, so go figure.....\n\nPeace folks....\n\n",
