I was on the floor fairly close up and the sound echoed there as well. It was bouncing all around the bubble roof of the place. It was the first time I ever saw the Dead play one set. They led off then Dylan/Petty followed which was anticlimatic. The one memory I have from the show besides the echo's was during Sugaree Jerry bumped the microphone with his head, the entire stand fell and Jerry made a feeble attempt to grab the stand before it fell. I thought he was going to fall right off the stage. Just one of those occurances that will be imprinted in my mind.",

It was funny for me to watch him.  He didn't even know the Dead, I'd dragged him there, but he was as determined as anyone.  The dashing onto the field didn't seem like a bad thing to me, but I guess it was a foreshadowing of more injurious behavior.  Anyway yes, the sound was bad for all 3 groups, and someone sold me some fake tabbage.  Should've known better, but hey, it was summer of '86, remember?  Krazy koncert.",

I even heard a lot of heads dismiss Dylan as a has-been. What most heads really seemed to be upset about was Tom Petty.\n\nIt was a sad and surprising experience.

I couldn't believe the Dead were the openers, and I had never seen a show where they rolled one set into another without a break.  Kind of funny to go from Mexicali into Estimated.  Sound was poor, even up front, and folks were talking during Dylan/Petty, though they were just fair.  I've seen much better Dylan shows, and Petty didn't help, MB I just like Dylan in smaller venues.

With binoculars, I could watch the kick drum; see it being hit and count at least a second or two before I would actually hear it. That is all I heard for the entire set\u00e2\u00a6. echoing bass drum. I was up to high in the seats to make the mad dash to the floor like most of the crowd did. I could only watch as people jumped on top of each other to get from balcony to floor and as security sprayed them with mace. I had read later that the Dead sound crew would not take advice from the metrodome staff on speaker placement and sound. Months later I saw Pink Floyd there and they had it dialed in\u00e2\u00a6sounded great. So it was not the venue to blame as much as the Dead sound crew. Imagine that, the same crew that would often use the first set as a sound check. Once at the Cal expo, they forgot to raise the fork lift that held the outfield speakers.  Nearly every year in Vegas, the crowd would have to chant\u00e2 turn it up\u00e2 before the back of the stadium could hear. One year in Denver, they forgot to turn on the speakers facing the side of the stage. When the sound crew was on, they were on\u00e2\u00a6but when they were off, look out.",

Sitting 11th row center, the sound was barely tolerable with a prolonged echo that just mixed up the drums and bass into a thick, murky swirl. Early on, the band looked like they were having an equally difficult time hearing themselves - after all, it was a dome - a dome designed to make loud sounds overly cacaphonous so as to intimidate visiting teams and their fans. i.e. the 'dome advantage' for the Twins and Vikings. Add to that, an extremely hot and muggy day that stressed whatever air conditioning there was. The sound was soup! Credit the band for giving it their best shot - there were a few moments where they looked liked they were enjoying themselves. By the the end of the Dead's long, one-set gig, we felt beat up by the sound and the steam. Sadly, the sound for Dylan's set was even worse. 3 stars for the recording, 1 star for such an unenjoyable gig.",

      "review_text": "Wierdest Deadshow Ever This was one of my earliest live GD shows and it was amazing. Huge crowd, and fun to see two major acts/bands trading headliner spots. (also caught the Dead set the next night in Troy, WI at Alpine Valley Amphitheater, where Dylan opened for the Dead; I missed Dylan's set that night, though). \n\nProblem, aside from it being in the Metrodome in the first place was that the sound towers in the middle of the arena were facing the stage, and there was this wash effect to the sound. The earlier commenters who were there mentioned a delay. I thought it was intentional. It was very washy, though. I was pretty well medicated at the time, as probably most folks there were also, and so I got used to it. But this show definitely was interesting. I honestly can't recall much of the Dead's set except that at the very beginning of the show, the mains at the stage were not working for at least half the first song, only the onstage monitors, so the band could hear, but nobody else. Finally, the sound guys got it together, but then there was the incredibly horrific acoustics in this venue to deal with. They never totally rose to the challenge. But Dylan's set closing \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" was transcendant, with him backlit with klieg lights, frizzy hair and all stickin' up. All in all, with the urban setting, the parking lot scene, and the wacked out sound environment, it may not have been the best show, but it was definitely one to remember...as much of it as I could. I think if I'd been more familiar with their material at the time of this show, I would remember more. The recordings here on the Archive can't reproduce the electricity of the moment, but they do sound better than it did in person. Four stars for the recording, since it preserves a unique moment in both the Dead's and Dylan's careers.",
