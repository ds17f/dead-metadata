Highlights for me are the forays into music/electronic sound art in Help; a long, spirited Jack Straw; the seamless vocal jam out of He's Gone into Smokestack (listen to the perceptive audience grabbing it at the first suggestion. You've got to love Dead audiences); Dan Healy's interactive delay effects at the end of Throwing Stones; and, for me, the best Stella Blue around. Notice how they let the jam go at the end. The teases and eventual climax send shivers down my spine.\n\nCrisp room mix, too. The snare drums crack and everything is sharp and percussive.",

Everyone would bring their tapes and put up a couple of their best.  Worcester 9/10/84 always topped the list.  The audience is right on top of you, the tapers are audibly inspired and the sound is sparkling.  This was a Jerry and Phil night all the way.  From a ridiculous Help>Slip>Franklin\u2019s, where Phil just boomed away and threw the night into another gear, to a crescendo building Jack Straw, where Jerry just ignites the crowd with his ascending guitar solos culminating in an erupting and magnificent \"jkstraw from Wichita...\", the beginning of the second set is as good as it gets.  The crowd went absolutely nuts\u2026the tape captures it so well that you thing you\u2019re right back there.  You know how you'd come out of a show with the evening's energy all over your face\u2026good or bad?

      "review_text": "\"Some times at  night, I think I understand\" This was an amazing night of  music from start to finish, the entire band is on. The quality of this board is vastly different and far superior than the majority from this time period and is a nice indulgence and  who knows why this is an exception. The opening Dancin is one of the best of the mid 80's and is played with a confidence and focus that drives it along.FOTD is exceptional with Brent really making this version  stellar. The rest of the set is great with the ending being most excellent.Phil's reckoning bomb after the last verse of Let it Grow is intense. There are mixes of audience sources at times, not always at the  best  spots but what can you do. Set two starts off with a slower tempo Help> Slipknot which is quite good, with some great peaks by Jerry. Franklin's is awesome with Bill & Mickey really laying down a great groove, the whole band swings. As they did the entire night. The ending of Franklin's is very cool how Jerry brings it down to a gentle landing and then wham! At the show we all were blown away by the selection of Jack Straw, as this version is full of passion and thrills. The He's Gone is one of my favorites and I  believe was the first one to include the extended vocal harmonies at the end, which sound great.They slip into a short Smokestack with  full vocals, a sweet gesture to Pigpen. The  D/S are very good as are favorite duo is focused on creating more memorable beats and gets tribal. What I like about space, is that Jerry & Bob play the same theme that was played before St. Stephen in late '83.Jerry has that level of distortion on guitar and it sounds as close as it's can get check it out. You  get a  intense Wheel> T.Stones and  then a remarkable Stella Blue, the ending is beautiful. A very rocking ending to the set, Bob even says good nite after JBG and then a great Revolution for JL's birthday.",

      "review_text": "Top Ten for 1984 ! When I am pressed to say why I like 1984 shows\nso well, I find it difficult to really define that certain quality that much of this year has. Kinda like a color or a flavor that they have no name for yet. Ever feel that way about a favorite year?\n\nThe words that come to mind are mellow, warm, gooey, melty and richly textured. Kinda like sitting in a hot tub while doing shrooms, which I recommend.\n\nWhen people talk about their preference for the early 80's versus the later \"commercial\" period, this show is close to the dividing line, and, although 1984 isn't nearly as strong as 1981 or 1982, both extremely good years, this show embodies much of the warmth and laid back feel of the period. Before they got \"famous\" on MTV and the Shakedown lot scene was still pretty safe and there was a lot of family feeling amongst the audience.\n\n1984 is also a year when you often get great song lists, combining the best of old and new. China>Rider, Morning Dew, China Doll, Shakedown, Uncle John, Wharf Rat, PLayin are all songs that were consistently well played - sometimes, dare I say it, even as well as some classic 70's shows. Another standout selection for 1984 are the many fine Help>Slipknot, of which the one here, and on 11/2/84 are as good as you'll find anywhere.\n\nSpeaking of the 1970's - look at the song set for this show. Except for Althea and Esau, Set One could easily be from 1977, or even earlier. And Set Two could also be from October 1977, with the exception of Throwing Stones. I love it when they do that. No bad Brent songs, no screeching Bobby C.C. Rider.\n\nSet One is a solid and smooth wave all the way. Dancin kicks it off nicely indeed. Jerry's voice is a bit rough during FOTD, but it gets better as the night goes on. Jerry and the band really take it up a notch with RxR Blues. Garcia is at his cotton pickin' best here, in the twang groove. Hearing this with Brent makes you wish they'd had an organ player back in say, 1972 when they really could kick the beans out of this song. This version ain't no slouch, and gets the band psyched up for ...... a stellar Let it Grow.\n\nThey take the Grow at a nice slower, precise tempo that allows for some breathing room, and for Jerry to stretch out and add some texture to the solos. Notice how he incorporates the main theme of the song into much of his last solo near the end.\n\nHelp kicks off Set Two with conviction, and again they take things at a sensible groove, not too fast. Slipknot is 8 minutes long and Jerry leads us thru a winding maze of sounds and colors. Poly rhythms abound, where's the beat? Where's my body? Masterfully, Jerry pulls it all together and restates the theme at 7:20. As good as that was, the real star of this little section is the Franklin's - and the crowd immediately reacts to the opening chords. Smell the Patchouli, taste the paper in the back of your throat and shake your groovy self. Nearly 11 minutes of funky fun, and Jerry takes the band all the way down for a 3 point landing.\nThen - a surprise and one of the reasons people love this show, a second set Jack Straw!! They're hitting on all cylinders now, and Jerry is throwing off sparkling leads left and right. The drummers and Phil really drive the song into the intensity lane and keep it there. The vocals are spot on. What more could a Jack Straw lover want?\n\nSomeone else mentioned that this was the first show where the band does the extended vocal riffs at the end of He's Gone. That may be correct, I don't know. But it's certainly another reason, another special touch that makes 1984 full of great shows. The crowd really gets into it. Full blown Gospel Church. This will heal what ails ya, brother! Bobby delivers a fine Smokestack and Jerry wails along in hot tones of red and purple.\n\nDrums avoids getting boring, and Space begins with the Polynesian steel drum and marimba effects while Jerry finds a groove to wah and growl with. A quiet comtempletive space ensues midway, then Jerry starts with bendy notes that signal the arrival of Wheel that features some fine harmonies.\n\nThe rest of the show is just as good, with the Stella Blue being the highlight. You have to forgive the boys for trying Revolution it was John's birthday after all, and it's still better than Day Job, heh?\n\nA fine addition to anyone's 80's collection, and other than a few minor AUD patches, an exceptional SBD for this period. 1984 was a trippy, mellow year for the Doctor. Were you there?\n\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

Tripping balls sitting in the very top row of the Centrum about 30 feet to the left of the house spots (they were still using house spots here) and seeing the solid beam of light going all the way down to the stage when they broke out of the jam and hit \"got two reason why i cry\" and thinking i could slide down that beam to the stage totally hooked my 16 year-old self on the Dead.\n\nLater i moved down and started roaming the lobby and ring walk and did not appreciate the 2nd set at all (6 tunes before AND 5 after drums/space) except for the \"Franklin's Tower\" at the time. Listening to it today i can appreciate i saw an amazing show with a bonus tribute to John Lennon in the encore that i knew as special but not how special (oct. 9 is Lennon's birthday.)",

      "review_text": "\"Smokestack Lightning Bobby . . .\" I hadn't listened to this show for years. Fall 1984 was my 2nd tour after summer 84. It was \"my hey-dey !\" Yes sir I was FULLY on board after experiencing Fall 84, Summer 85; early & late, and Fall 1985. Imo the music holds up more than well after all these years. That time period is strong \"RINGING TRUE IN MY OLD MEMORY.\" As good as it got for me. For sure I felt 87 was a great year and Fall 1989, Spring 1990 thru all of 1991 THE DEAD were I arguably at the top of their game. But this time period here just was IT, a lot having to do with it being my jumping off spot. Anyways 10/9/84 was a good one. The tour started to steamroll this night. It was the 1st \"Smokestack\" sans Pigpen. I remember I was sitting 4th row center, & as they hit that 1st VERY recognizable note some Head sitting behind the band yelled \"Smokestack Lightning Bobby . . .\" nailing it. I'm a huge \"Jack Stra\" fan & hearing them pull o e out mid set two was SWEET. It was a good one too-solid, it's just the one they played at The Carrier Done was one of the most sublime pieces of music I ever heard the boys lay down. In my humble opinion That \"Jack Straw\" from 10/20/84 is arguably the BEST \"Jack Stra\" they e er played. I don't say that lightly it just us. But as I say this one wasn't shabby naki g Fall 74 memorable for the \"Jack Straws\" played. The \"He,'s Gone\" & \"Revolution\" being nice nods to John Lennon it being his birthday and all. This was a solid show and I felt then, & still do it was the night that Fall 84 took off promising to he a \"better than run of the mill\" tour for the boys. The 2bd night in Augusta Me was a top 5 Dead show, outta 400+, the Carrier Come . . . An amazing tour that \"really\" started here at The Centrum in Worcester Town as my good friends the twins and their you get brother, locals proudly refer to their beloved hometown. Thanks for the memories Deadlists . . .",

      "review_text": "The Band Beyond Description on a Fall Night in New England I was there, just a wide-pupiled college kid on a bender. Center stage at the way-back top, with my back against the breathing wall.  Dancing and dancing and hoping for El Paso, but rewarded with a stellar Jack Straw. A thick New England fog swirling as I walked back out to the Holy Cross Campus with the old electric train going round and round the track inside my skull... I've had plenty of days without sunshine but this was not one of them... ",

      "review_text": "Fall '84 N4 This one, for me, is a little too unwieldy. I know it gets a fair (good) amount of love, listed #22 in DeadBase XI for \"favorite tapes\" of '84 and all. And yes, the first set is a hoot. I especially dig the opening Dancing in the Street. \"Fall is here and the time is right!\" (Dancin' returned 7/7/81 after 128 shows - last played 12/10/79 - then not again for another 203 shows until 6/24/84. This is the fourth of six played in '84.) Killer Slipknot! jam in the opening Help-Franklin's sequence, but Idk, similar to the LIG, it hovers on the precipice and sort of loses me- lyrical blunders throughout certainly don't help.\u00a0\n\nNeat placement on the Jack Straw- following the Franklin's Tower. It's not exceptional, but well-executed. He's Gone vocal freak-out and exit jam is probably my highlight from the night. Transition into The Wheel hits the spot, too.\u00a0 \u00a0All in all, not a great show - certainly not five-star, perhaps not even four-star-\u00a0 \u00a0 but I think these fall '84 shows are better than anticipated.\u00a0\n\nRelatively rare, \"Revolution,\" only played 11x, last played 52 shows prior on 10/31/83, is sleepy (and rusty) for an encore. They'd play it one more time in '84, 3x in '85, and twice in Sp90 before retiring it for good.\u00a0",
