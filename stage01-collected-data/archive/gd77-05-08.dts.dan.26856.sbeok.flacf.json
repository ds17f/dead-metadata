      "review_text": "be advised: I'm glad to see this up here - this DTS mix is really quite amazing, not to mention an incredible labor of love to get the sources synched up.  But people who are new to DTS should know that you can ONLY (as far as I know) listen to this from a CD played on a DTS-compatible player (most DVD players will work) - and then only through a DTS-compatible receiver (which most newer ones are). I'm not sure if the non-FLAC formats (mp3, etc) will work and I know the streaming audio definitely WILL NOT WORK!\n\nThis is from the textfile:\n-----\nMore On DTS\n\nToday's audio standards are moving towards multi-channel sound, like DTS and Dolby Digital.  While the Audio-CD standard (Red Book) hasn't changed to accommodate these new sound formats, it is still possible to go around the specification and to put a 5.1 surround recording on a regular Audio-CD.  To play a DTS-Audio-CD you must connect your DVD/CD player via a digital cable (optical or coaxial) to your DTS Dolby-Digital receiver. It is not 100% sure that your receiver will recognize a DTS-Audio CD, so the first time you're trying to playback a DTS-Audio-CD you must do a test to determine if it can. Begin with the volume very low, start the disc and raise the volume gradually. NEVER listen to a DTS-Audio-CD through the analog audio outputs of your CD/DVD player.\n\nBurning Instructions:\nBurn them the absolute same way as you would burn any normal Audio-CD from FLAC files.\n\nIf you play this DTS-Audio-CD and hear static it is b/c you didn't really read the text file, did you?",

I am using Power DVD XP and a sound blaster Audigy 4 card. \n  Follow the instructions in the post above i.e. down load the flacs decode to wav and burn to CD-R. As far as I can determine the files MUST be burned to audio CD format.\n   If you are using only two speakers or headphones turn on TruSurroundXT in Power DVD to process multichannel to two channel surround.\n This is an awesome show!!! The audio quality and surround effects are just over the top!\nBURN ONE DOWN AND CRANK IT UP!",

They are on point the entire show (except Bobby, but he sucks anyway so it doesn't matter, but that's another issue entirely)...There are many who claim this show as \"the best Grateful Dead show, period\" but I wouldn't go so far as to say that, because it's all a matter of opinion and personal taste. I prefer Brent to Keith, so I can't agree with that claim, but I can understand where it comes from. If you don't have this show, you're missing out!",

      "review_text": "almost 30 years - i am so grateful!!! i am joining this venue to wax about this killer concert- which i saw almost 30 years ago. i was 20 years old, had loved the dead for 2 years, but never had a chance to see them live until this fateful, blessed day. continued to see the dead (50 times??) through the 90's but this was always my favorite- experienced standing only 2 people removed from the stage, equidistant from the pa system on my left and jerry on my right-- both perhaps 15 feet away. and when bobby (?) asked everyone to take a step back (and another-- and another) because of the bug eyed people up front--- well, i was one of them but i was going nowhere but forward. i was in heaven, in the presence of god, and i only wanted to get closer!\n\ni mostly remember the BEAUTIFUL music, scarlet>fire, jack straw, st. stephen>not fade away, morning dew- drinking in the beauty and energy, realizing that there truly was nothing like a dead concert, and after the show passing by the sound board and thinking how all the music i just heard went through it (and am so thankful now for the crystalline recording of this inspired performance that i can now, and do, relive regularly)- and walking out into the cold- well- just snow!! (it was a warm may upstate evening going in) and getting marooned overnight in the car with friends after driving off the side of the country road, waiting for the morning sun to show us the way back to buffalo, where i was then going to school.\n\nplaying with the idea of seeing dso in ithaca for the 30th anniversary, but in some ways the pure experience lives most clearly in my mind and the music which is available here. thanks for keeping the music alive!",

      "review_text": "Not sure if it was the \"best show of '77\"... but for me it was!\n\nI was lucky enough to be a freshman at CU that year and even luckier to be with the Cornell Concert Committee working on the stage crew.\n\nThat afternoon, we met the GD road crew. From the start, they were a friendly and laid-back group of guys that had no problem working with us - a bunch of eager 18-20 year olds. In fact, at one point, I found myself at the top of a twenty foot scaffold helping one of the crew get the massive PA speakers in place. As the set took form and sound checks were done, we all waited anxiously for the show to begin.\n\nThe lights went out around 8pm and the crowd roared as they heard the first notes of Minglewood. That first set was certainly killer but, after admittedly getting thoroughly stoned during the intermission, I was blown away by the second set.\n\nStarting out with a brilliant Scarlet Fire then ending the set with an awe-inspiring St. Stephen/NFA/St. Stephen/Morning Dew; it was ethereal. (No doubt my state of mind had something to do with it, but that's the point of it all, no?)\n\nThe Saturday Night encore topped off an incredible show, and I was surprised at my lack of disappointment now that the it was over. Instead, I felt satisfied, a sense of completion.\n\nNow, with all work ahead to break down the set, I had to get back up that 20 ft. scaffold. The only problem was that I was a lot \"higher\" than I was the first time. But, I got plenty of encouragement from the same affable roadie I'd worked with before. \"Hey, you helped me put 'em up there without a hitch; I'm sure you can get 'em down, no problem!\" Working the stage ended up being almost as enjoyable as watching the show. It was surely as rewarding.\n\nSo, around 4am or so, as the last eighteen-wheeler drove away, my crew members and I went downtown to an all-night diner for breakfast, and waxed poetic (or something like that) about what we had just experienced.\n\nAs I was walking home finally to get some sleep, around 5:30am that morning it started to snow. I thought it was a perfect way to bring it all to a close. And I will never forget that day...",

      "review_text": "actually there I was also a freshman at CU and at the show.  It was the night before \"study week\", so there was a lot of pent-up energy in the crowd.  Later, when the show got famous, I wondered if that had anything to do with it.  I remember 4 things: (1) we almost got crushed going in; (2) it was Mother's Day, hence the Mama Tried and Bobby's \"Thanks, Mom\"; (3) I'd be lying if I said I remembered every song, but Jerry's climbing, ascending, magical solo on \"Morning Dew\" registered immediately as immortal; and (4) it really did snow on the way out, which at the time I figured was Cornell's way of telling us to get back to work.  Thanks, Jerry.  I miss you.",
