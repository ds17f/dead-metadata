As I remember it this show was an add on to the 77 tour, but I am not positive that was the case. I had just graduated college in Tennessee and was hanging around with a friend in Charlottesville, VA at his mother's farm. We had been lazing around for a few days when on the morning of 5/25 we heard on a Richmond rock and roll station that The Dead had added a show to their tour, at least that is what I thought we heard. So we decided later that day to raise up out of our post graduation summertime haze and drive an hour over to Richmond to see if we could get a ticket to our first Dead show. No problem getting in, but frankly  getting the ticket was about the last thing I remember about the show. As I remember the grog weed was more potent than the show, and I think I even fell asleep during space. Whoops guess there wasn't any space, but I just left my body somewhere during the second set . Actually didn't hardly remember that I had seen the Dead until a month later. Fortunately the following year, I saw the band again in Blacksburg, under the right chemical conditions and was finally \"on the bus\". \nSo I must say now 28 plus years later, and a hundred or so shows later, I have gotten the chance to hear this show again. And I must agree with those other reviewers, this was one great show. And I that is with a totally clear and unaltered mind that I listen to this show. Glad to have a second chance. And I am totally amazed at the sound quality of this recording. Thanks to whoever did such a great job. tal",

The 1/2 step and the Cassidy are sweet and well done, though I would've like to hear more of a jam on the 1/2 step.\n\nPhil plucks out a really funky baseline to Scarlet, and the main body of this Scarlet is excellent and lots of fun. The Scarlet jam was a bit spacy for my taste, though.  Donna moans like she's conducting some sort of tribal ceremony ... or like she's in labor.  I much prefer the 11/30/80 Scarlet jam. \n\nFire is good, but nothing particularly special, IMHO.  Same for Estimated. And, I find Estimated>He's Gone to be sort of a let down.  I much prefer Estimated>Eyes.  Eyes is just a much more fun and uplifting tune. \n\nThe \"Other One, Wharf Rat, Other One\" didn't do it for me, either.  Wharf Rat is such a melancholy tune.  Somewhat romantic, but very melancholy.  Its so sad to think of a guy spending half his life in jail for someone else's crime and the other half stumbling around drunk on burgandy wine. \n\nI just couldn't enjoy the rest of the show after getting into that state of mind.\n\nI don't know.

They did well at the coliseum but the sound in the coliseum does not compare to the Mosque.It was a shame they never came back to the Mosque, but it doesn't seat that many people and with their fan base swelling to ridiculous proportions they had to start using larger venues.

      "review_text": "I agree with everything said below... See what people said below.  5/5.  This show stuns me!\n\nOther people have said this might be the best of May 1977.  That is certainly a valid and strong argument.  I first thought 5/8/77 was the best (or maybe I should talk about favorites) - the playing is almost perfect and the sound is the best found on this site.  Then I migrated to 2/26/77 as my favorite, and that is still my favorite version of Estimated Prophet.  The first is always the best, no?\n\nThen much later on I heard 4/23/77 (the Springfield show) and I just loved that Scarlet > Fire.  There are some second set Palladium shows which are also simply superior.  But now I'm on this concert.  This very well might be my favorite of all May 1977.  Scarlet > Fire is just off the hook, it's a great second set, the Other one is fabulous (but the one a few days earler at The Fox in Atlanta is better).\n\nI mean, I just can't get enough of 1977.  I like this year so much because it's jamming with an underlying rhythm.  Sometimes I'm not into 1970-73 because the jamming can get quite spacey on Dark Star, The Other One, and at times Playin' and Eyes of the World.  I do like those concerts, but I personally like jamming within a framework of a song.  All years after this with few exceptions are just not as good.\n\nIt's a shame that late 1977 just doesn't match up to Spring 1977.  Many of the soundboards have Keith jacked up, plus he's playing his piano (I think) in a different mode which I don't like as much.  The Lazy Lightnin' > Supplications start getting progressively worse in the fall 1977 and continue to decline into the late 1970's and early 1980's.  I just love this time.",

I would put it right up there with Boston Garden, Cornell University, Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, and Pembroke Pines for '77.  Heck, I would have given anything to be at any of these concerts back in 1977!  But I was stationed overseas in Okinawa at the time.\n\nDownload the Charlie Miller remaster:\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1977-05-25.sbd.miller.87591.sbeok.flac16\n\nHalf-Step, Jack Straw, and Peggy-O are simply amazing!  Now if you really want a Half-Step that is in a class by itself, then check out the one from 5-8-77 at Boston Garden!\n\nAnd the 2nd set speaks for itself!

I like the D'ohing at the beginning of the tune, interesting to here it at the end. The breaking drum beats at the beginning had me all ears. The rythmn devils really are the horse power in this show IYAM. I prefer promised land earlier in the first. BEW puts the glint back into the eye only to fade into set break. Want me leaving more! I like the estimated eyes combo too, but the He's Gone does fit well with the tempo this show. Other one is really good and starts to bring the boogie train to town (as if it could fit!) Around & Around had me out of my seat... who needs the mens room, lets do it right here baby! btw if you can remember why I called Big River for next show half way through Other One... let me know. \n\np.s.

I guess it's because I've always found the Half-Step and Scarlet>Fire a bit bland compared to the heavy hitters of the month, but I've really been missing out on some of the other tunes. Set 1 has a great Cassidy, LL>Supp, and BEW. \n\nSet 2 from Estimated is just transcendent, though. Now, there are several great Other Ones in 77 I've recently discovered, which never really used to be a favorite year of mine for the tune. 3/20, 5/13, 5/18, 5/21, and 11/5 are all fantastic, but this might easily be the best post-hiatus Other One I've ever heard; Jerry is absolutely fucking possessed and all over the map. It's the must hear part of this show, and just another amazing example of his endless genius. Wharf Rat and the Wheel are incredibly beautiful, and Round and Round sends things out on a very high note.\n\nI guess there is a reason this show is so popular and now I think I finally understand!",
