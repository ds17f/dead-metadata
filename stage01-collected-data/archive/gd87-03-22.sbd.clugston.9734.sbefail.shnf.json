The energy was palpable, as it was for the entire tour, it seemed.\n\nThe Sugar Mags>Scarlet>Fire was just inspired and the Black Peter was clearly moving in a way that it hadn't been before (and would cease to be again, although not before Jerry knocked our socks off with the Peter from 4/2/87).

He looked good and was wearing red. They never disappointed in Hamp and this opener of three nights was epic. The whole tour was stellar and it was nice to see the boys having fun. If memory serves it was general admission and we went in early and grabbed some prime real estate on Jer's side way up front. He hhad a twinkle in his eye and pulled out the vista cruiser to let everyone know just how well he was feeling. The scene was classic east coast spring time. everyone was full of good vibes and tickets were easy to score in the lot. And as usual the prettiest girls in the world were well represented and scantily clad as the weather was post card perfect.",

      "review_text": "A solid '87 installment To counter 'birdsgosouth' derogatory remarks: Originally, I selected '87 because it's a natural 'third act' starting point. Although your emotional pleas are valid; I'm writing these reviews from more of a critical perspective as an ancedote to dull days at the office. Finally, referring to your hilariously misinformed 'you're lost' statement...I'm quite aware of '87's reputation, from both other people and my own collection. However, I'm trying to provide a guide to people in search of 'quality' shows from this period, not those looking to relive their own deified live experiences. Admittedly, I'm not one of those reviewers who will reward a tape 5 stars simply because it's great for '87. 5 stars are reserved  for the all-time greatest shows, (ie 8/27/72, 2/13&14/70, etc.,) not for some 'outstanding' '87 show, (like the one from Alpine) that couldn't hold a candle to most nights from '72-'74.\n\nAnyone is welcome to write with their thoughts, comments, and/or concerns:  jboyaquar@yahoo.com\n\nThank you, webmaster, for allowing this disucssion.\n\n1st Set: Moderately hot \"Hell\" opens the show with the boosting Bang an anticipant crowd wanted. Effortlessly glides into \"Sugaree\" It's always reassuring to intangibly feel the crowd's appreciative energy; the version is standard. A playfully pokey \"All Over Now\" continues the evening's proceedings. Frankly, Bobby's guitar work here is awkward amateur hour; it's just in the way. Smartly, there's really no stop as \"West\" immediately rears its face. Funny enough, I dug the ugly guitar interplay on this one. \"El Paso\" is pretty but meekly voiced by Weir. \"Push\" is \"Push.\" No more, no less. \"Cassidy\" is slightly above-average energy wise. \"Deal\"'s got that easy-going charge that epitomized this brisk, fairly good 1st set. \n\n \n\n2nd Set: Surprise! \"Sugar\" puts smiles on everyone's face...There's still something off about W's voice; his deep masculine growl is no where to be found. It also lacks a certain fierceness that makes the best ones memorable. \"Scarlet->Fire\" stands out nicely. Scarlet is more than competently run through tho it's 'Fire' and Jerry's reaching to the heavens solo that leaves an impression. \n(Still, this is '87, one of the least jammy years in Dead History, therefore this 'Fire,' tho very good for '87, is still just average overall.) \"Estimated\" jaunts and jives tho Bobby's so not roaring :( Those Drummers are mean to be teasing the NFA they won't be hearing tonight. Short but enthusiastic performance. \"The Wheel\" builds on the serenity and inner peace of the 'Space' which segues nicely into a touching \"Black Peter.\" Kinda disappointed a GDTRFB didn't follow, but the perfunctory 'Sunshine' satisfies just enough. Garcia throughtfully punctuates \"Baby Blue\" to conclude this pretty good opening gig of a three night stand @ the Coliseum.",

      "review_text": "Shurgymagnolia Yo fellers and gals, there is no comparing a '72 Grateful Dead show to an '87 Grateful Dead, Period. That would be like comparing a Rottweiler to a miniature Poodle. You have different keyboards, no Pig, no Donna or Keith, NO LSD circulating in and out of the co-mingling energies including the bands', the audience, and one that none of us really can describe in our limited understanding of what spirituality really is. Sometimes the music played the band, others was the intimate, no matter how grand a show, eye contact and back and forth transfer of this energy between the Dead, the Fans And The Unknown. Hampton, Always produced amazing shows. This was no fluke. Pick it apart as you will, but I'm a survivor of 1976 shows and upward till the end. I'll tell you my freinds, this show was no Europe '72, But, the Energy transfer in the mid to late 80's was, was indescribable, can't be described in Human Terms. I feel so sorry for the older Dead Heads that could not accept the fact that things change. That's what the Dead are all about. Change. Jerry Loved Brent as did Phil and the whole band. Brent Brought us all a renewed Garcia for many years. I suggest you open your minds just a little bit further, just a little bit more, a little more open than you've gone before ! God Bless Jerry, the Grateful Dead. (And the Warlocks!!)",

Hartford, worcester...this band is tearing it up. However, I would certainly read his reviews over half the people who post to this site. He approaches it the way I do. I review the actual show on song selction and the level of playing. I don't give a show 5 stars because a hot chick took her top off at the gig. The show that got me steamed about this is the last show at Soldier Field. garbage to say the least. But I see plenty of 5 star reviews because Jerry was God or The band meant so much to them. They meant a lot to me too, but I can most certainly tell you that if a newbie asked me to define the GD and what show would most likely turn them onto them, it most certainly would NOT be the soldier field gig in 95, but based on some reviews you'd never know it. One last thought...we all like different time periods in the band history and I will never try to pursuade someone into liking one over the other but to give a 5 star rating to a 95 show means that the level is as good as barton Hall 77. You can take that from here...",

Also the SSDD is probably my al time Fav - not to be missed.

The more I listen to 87' the more psychedelic it sounds in comparrison to 88-90' I like how loose it sounds.Estimated is soft as a pillow. The drumers sound fine tonight. Billy is having a good night especially.Excellent guitar by Weir on the Wheel. I had to stop and listen to Cassidy. it got interesting.Sugar Magnolia was consistent in 87.It's difficult to rate the sound because it's only a stream. What a way to open the spring tour. San Fransisco civic 87's are a forgotten memory.Hello Rich Taylor, We camped out in Livermore,Ca. looking for my Marantz tape deck.",

To let the old jams make way for the new is what the Dead is. Enjoy your pre-77 shows if that's what you dig but let the rest of us enjoy our fun too! :) Peace, bro. \n\nI love this show and this whole run. Each show has a style of playing throughout that make these a truly unique set of music for this chapter of the Grateful Dead.",

If you don't like the 80's shows why the f*&&& would you waste your time finding this show, and writing a review! Doesn't anyone ever get the whole point, that it's always, with everything, about change. Change brought us the Internet, and if it wasn't for that we'd all be listening to crapola tape cassettes that were paper thin by now, and not be able to surf all this wonderful history!! What a bunch of jackasses. Listen to the music play, you douchebags, cause you are obviously confused. Or, do what the reviews are here for, and record your thoughts on the sound quality, not your personal opionion on what genre is better or worse. \nMOST of you are kind, but you know who you are, you tawdry negative twats.",

Bob comes out with a hard ass Hell in a Bucket, Jer follows with a sweet Sugaree and this show never loses momentum after. Not the greatest actual set lists but its a tight show. Gimme a Sailor/Circumstance,maybe a Wharf Rat in there but this show was hot,band hot,crowd hot,nuff said (~);}",
