The DArk Star get out, and the move into ElPaso is fantastic.  Everything else is very well done.\n\nThis is the beginning of the post pigpen, one drummer, really loose jams that tended to define '73 and '74.  I think this show gets overshadowed by 8-27, but this one is well worth the download.\n\nGet it.",

      "review_text": "Don't Miss This! This show is a favorite among older Deadheads and\n tape collectors, because it was widely available  and also because it's really good! So good in fact, that this was one of the doctor's top shows\n for 1972 until I heard 8/24, and that one beat it \n out. Well, it's hard to top a Dark Star>Morning  Dew combination (Jerry tries it on this night,  but Phil and Billy have other ideas - see below).\n\nNevertheless, this is a superb show in many ways \n and it's guaranteed to thrill. Set One looks a lot like Europe 72, with a stacked deck of great  songs like Sugaree, Jack Straw, He's Gone, BE  Women and the welcome return of FOTD on this run,\n not since Spring Tour 1971!\nPlayin is now all grown up as a jam vehicle, well  seasoned from the Europe tour (check out the 30  min. version from 5/26!) This one is shorter but\n leaves you wanting for nothing, featuring some  lovely acoustic piano work from Keith along with\n Garcia's wah wah blazing above the mix. A very  jazzy and up tempo version that serves as an  appetizer for what's to come.\n\nThe Dark Star is naturally the main course, and  has been favorably compared to 4/8/72. For a good  description, read Henry Kaiser's review in  Deadbase. A very complex and explorative version,\n with many moods. They play around with the main\n A to G theme for a while on the mellow side. Then\n halfway through, Jerry revs it up for some very\n fast runs on the wah wah, and then the Star  explodes in dissonant fury and fireworks - buckle\n up and hang onto your brain for this! Then Jerry   decides he's ready to do Morning Dew, but Phil  has other ideas, and he and Billy manage to turn  the jam into a fast jazzy train ride before  everyone drops out and lets Keith take over with\n some sparkling piano riffs. The short jam after\n El Paso is interesting as well.\nThe surprises continue with the new addition of\n Half Step, and instead of the normal NFA to end,\n they pull out an Uncle John's Band.\n\nA great show to add to your 1972 collection, and\n one of the better Dark Stars of the year if you\n like em wild and weird!\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

It is not the prettiest (see dane county '73), but it will twist your brain and make your dog start barking at you.  I feel pity for the poor souls who were too high on LSD at this concert.  May G.O.D. have mercy on their souls.\n\nLater with the use of midi and whatnot they could make 'em even more evil like florida '89... but I prefer the good ol' days when we didn't have midi and we liked it.  This dark* is RAW dead with Jerry at his best.  As the Dark* progresses out of chaos Jerry starts going into the \"Morning Dew\".  That, according to Phil, was not what the Vibes needed.  \nPhil needed to get things groovin' for another 10 minutes with a Booty-Smackin funk jam to show us where the music could go if he wanted it to go there.   Just to let ya know, \n\nYes, we really did just freak the \"F\" out like that on purpose.\n\nSo who the hell else would jump into a giddy-up Western Swing classic like \"El Paso\" after a MASSIVE musical FReaKoUt?\n\nFor that matter, what the hell kinda band goes back into space after playing \"El Paso\"?\n\nOnly the best band ever would, that's who.  \nBig Balls and No Fear.\n\ngreat sound for its time.

      "review_text": "Playin' In The Band Equisite One of the first songs I listen to for new shows is Playin' In The Band.  Other people usually turn to Dark Star, maybe something else.  But I like Playin'  because it has a catchy, great tune and then an intense jam, followed by the remaining tune.  Dark Star oppositely is just basically a jam.\n\nAnyway this Playin' is absolutely fantastic.  First, Bob articulates every single word into the microphone.  In later years he sometimes misses words here or there, or changes the cadence.  The enunciation of Playin' here is as written - and that's why I like it.  By the 80's and beyond the song changed too much for me to really like.\n\nThe jam is also just utterly brillant.  I've been listening to the jams around this time period, specifically 8/24/1972 and 8/27/1972 and they are all good, but this one sizes up the best.  The jam gets really fast, but everyone is in sync.  Sometimes jams have all band members playing kind of different rythyms, all coalescening together.  But this one, they are synchronized to a blazing fast beat.  It is primarily driven by Keith's piano playing.  The piano sound and it's wicked thrust really drives Jerry, Phil and Bob into the song.  There is a nice calm segue into the end of of Playin' too.  Listen around the 8 minute mark.\n\nA few other comments - having one drummer makes a difference, I think.  It allows me to concentrate on the other musical instruments.  When there are two drummers, you get this syncopated, skippy beat.  Also, the kind of piano Keith plays is so much better than the tinker-bell popsy piano used by Brent.  It's real music, not one produced by a bunch of kids playing on a $200 electric piano.\n\nThis concert gets 5 star in my book.  I'm beginning to like 1972 as much as the may shows of 1977, when I consider the Dead at the professional musical peak (plus songs like The Wheel, Terrapin, Estimated, Scarlet > Fire all came out by that time.)\n\nLastly, note that this recording has a slight hiss.  It's not perfect, especially when you listen to it at high volumes.  But can't downgrade because of that.",

They feel full of energy and provide a superb performance.\n\nThis is the night that they introduce Keith and Donna Godchaux were introduced into the family of the band this evening.  The audio is right before Playin in the band... not sure if the stream captured it or not.  I didn't listened to this streaming version.\n\nBrown Eyed Women is superb.  It is right on, sounds like they are all connection in this one.  It's got good energy and Bobby sounds great.  Most of the songs in this concert are have these qualities... this is a great concert to own.  The Dead seem to play individual songs rather than jam out a 15-20 minute versions of each song.  It's an unusual quality for the Grateful Dead but it is a nice set of terrifically performed songs.\n\nBlack Throated Wind is awesome.  This is certainly my favorite version of this song.  The opening guitar sounds a bit wavey and psychadelic; it sounds so darn good.\n\nGood rendition of Gratest Storey Ever Told, very high energy.  Donna is showin why she should stay with the band.

It was a magical night. It was unforgettable. It was willed into being.\n\nAnd the Dead? The Dead did not disappoint us, well... for a Monday, man, like, y'know? \n\nThis was a sitdown affair. The Grateful Dead serenaded us true and factual and blue. After the initial musical chairs and nervous ushers demanding that concertgoers remove their leaping extremities out of the aisles, the band settled us in with remarkable renditions of all of our favorite hits. The sound in Berkeley Community Theater was immaculate and the GD figured that hall out quick.\n\nOf the four BCT shows that year, this one, as great as it is, placed fourth. This, and all the shows of this run, was a Betty Board with Bear mixing front of house. \n\nThis show is a finely pure recording of an amazingly energized band. Yet, it does not outdo the next night(22nd) which is a better show. Then the Thursday show(24th) was better than the Tuesday. However, the Friday show(25th) was the king and queen of all the nights. And then, Two days later, they went, also, to Oregon, to Veneta.\n\nSpectacular regeneration!\n\nThe band was in its champing at the bit best.\n\nThey played all the songs that we wanted to hear.\n\nDuring Half Step we did a group hug and bid one another a tearful farewell. It was the end of an era for us. It was the end of a friendship never re-kindled. We sensed the reality of the moment merely from the overtone of finality inherent in the rhythm of this tune. It was finished. \n\nFrom that moment on, we thus admitted and notated, that the old gang started to deplete one by one and sink into the whylight of imagination.\n\nShall we conjure them back into the whylight?\n\nDon't need to...the GD fill in all the blanks -- as if there is no tomorrow.

Europe tour set up the Playing in the Band jam and in general standardized more variety in setlists, introduced the heads to keith and donna for better or worse, but this is all fun and games compared to summer and fall. This show is unbelievable. Before i discovered the power of this show, and shows like the Stanley Run in September, the Fox show in October, and so many others, i generally was under the impression that the development of the sound and jams was more of a 73' thang, but boy was i wrong. This show has the Greatest Greatest story ever told, hands down. Even with the Donna whaling, its well worth it. Keith and Jerry smoked hippie crack before the show and it almost seems like their in a contest of who can outplay one and other. And if you know 71-74' Keith, you know thats quite an amazing feet. The Dark Star>El Paso>Space>Morning Dew is primal Dead. absolutely nessesary!! I think Bobby goes \"whew!!!\" at the end of every verse he sings in every song at this show.

The me and my uncle is rocking, and is definitely one of my favorites. The dark star is also a great one. From the first song to last this concert is energy filled and one not to be missed.",

      "review_text": "Serious Garcia Promised Land comes roaring out after a short Billy Graham intro. Nice piano work in particular.\nHe\u2019s Gone takes an unusual spot in the set list and is well executed.\nBobby pulls out a spirited and purdy much perfect BTW!\nFOTD is twangy and fast. Keith is a little louder than I think he should be, but he puts in a great effort here, as does Bobby.\nJack Straw\nChina>Rider, the first solo is through the roof with a massive Phil bomb and Jerry doubling up on some lightning scales. The transition jam is fun with a nice rhythm and early transition over to Rider, good Bobby! This is seeming to be somewhat of a Bobby night, actually. Keith and Jerry are also outstanding, hell, the whole team is! During Rider Jerry has some nice vibrato going adding yet more twang.\nMAMU really knocked my socks off coming after the C>R! They were already on this show, and this put them through the stratosphere.\nSugaree\nBIODTL\nStella is performed to a T with more energy than usual. Great rendition with a nice crash down before \u201cit all rolls into one\u201d. The final jam is solid as well, A+ version of Stella Blue.\nPITB comes strong as well. This is a shorter version, for the period, unfortunately\u2026 and Donna is so freaking obnoxious. Bobby must have been banging her to allow her to defile his song like this. The jam, however, is out of this world, short as it may be! They break through to ludicrous speed and everyone is on point at the same time, X factor.\nBEW\nMexicali is at hyperspeed as well, with Jerry again pulling out the double scales. \nCasey Jones has a good amount of energy, and a cut.\n\nGSET has to be up in the best ever renditions to blow the doors off the start of the 2nd set! A+ version.\nRamble On\nDark Star>El Paso>Space>Deal\nThis meat sequence has a Dark Star that keeps a nice tempo and thematic jam until after the 1st verse, when it pretty much collapses into space. It is a dark and creepy place, the jam picks up intensity though and isn\u2019t a snoozing space. At the 16th minutes we get into what can no longer be considered space but exploratory jamming, my favorite. It reminds me of\u2026 nothing! It\u2019s totally unique and Jerry kills it, you\u2019ll feel like your tripping practically. Shortly before the 20 minute mark it heads back into a spacey feel. There is no Tiger in this one, as someone mentioned in a review. Jerry does try to do Dew, but the rest of the band declines his invitation, which is pretty funny and rare. Instead Jerry accepts their refusal and joins back into the energetic jamming that developed again. This slows back down and suddenly finds itself into a soft El Paso, more vocally pleasing than anything. It does pick up speed and intensity, but I prefer a more forward Garcia and a few more chances from Keith. It disappears unceremoniously into a space segment, which then somehow leads into Deal! Strange indeed. The Deal is the real deal.\nSugar Magnolia features yet more Garcia on point action.\nHalf-Step in its 6th rendition.\nUJB>OMSN\u2026 false, there is a full stop. The UJB is really good!\n\n\nPerformance Summary\nThis is one of those shows that has solid playing all the way through. It has some bells and whistles too boast as well (one of four Dark Star>El Paso, break out of \u201cspace\u201d, if you want to consider it that)\u2026 You can\u2019t lose with this one.\n\nSound Quality\nA+, This is the only available source, and it\u2019s about as good as you will find from the era.",

      "review_text": "Stellar Stella This is the best Stella Blue I have ever heard. Honestly though, this is a song I often skip. Here though, Jerry shows full intent: vocal and guitar. Just as importantly though, the rest of the band is on the same page; that is playing with subtlety. The mix is also strikingly competent complements all of this wonderfully. In a word: captivating. \nThis show is a keeper for sure. Excellent sound, playing and overall vibe. Did I see somewhere this is a Bear/Betty collaboration? Jeez Louise!",

This is the fast version like Workingman's--which gets an added boost from Keith's playing.\n\nNice Jack Straw with a full sound and Phil up front with his backing vocals. This song started out pretty much as a Weir tune Oct-71 but it evolves into a group tune much like Truckin' always is or the Weight in later years.\nJerry adds his lead vocals-which started during Europe 72. \nI have said it before but i love Phil in the vocal mix.\n\nChina >Rider- a beauty of a China Cat \nwith Phil again way up in the vocal mix for RIDER.\n\nGreat jam in the RIDER and Jerry's vocals on point.\nListen to Phil render those backing vocals. \n\nMy son is graduating from Navy boot camp. i am very proud of him. \n\nMe & My Uncle-How could anyone quantify what would make for the best version of this tune?\nSugaree-So freaking mellow.\n\"You know in spite of all you gain\"\nBIODTL-Great dance tune. this is a good version with some nice pre-DJG backing vocals. \nGarcia seems to bend some notes on this version.\nA sign to me that he is rested and relaxed.\nStella Blue-Love the placement here. It seemed like a heavy load for STELLA to always be in the last ballad of the night spot. The song is in it's infancy here with much of its So Many Roads still to be explored.\n\nWeir takes a moment to Intro Donna & Keith\nStraight into PITB. Whatever a person's take on DJG entry into the GD universe i think the set-up of Donna singing back-up and then exiting for the jam was a gateway for the band to explore PLAYING.\n O.K. fellas let's hit the gas and see where we can go.\nAnd then Donna off stage probably dancing her butt off until they hit the reprise. COOL BEANS!.\nremember this song started off in Feb 18 1971 and probably clocked in at around 5 minutes \nBUT listen to this version \nnot yet in the 20 minute range of 1973 \nbut so intricate and involved.\nB.E. Women- as always one of my favorites\n\"By God let's do MEXICALI\"-Phil\n\"We forgot about that one\" Bobby \nCasey Jones-Interesting how this is another one of those tunes that the band either played as a 1st set closer or as the encore. My take on this is that the tune pretty much plays itself ( in much the same way as U.S. Blues)\nSo it doesn't put an overwhelming demand on the band.\nEither way you slice it for a tune that pretty much defined the band to the outside world especially FM Album Oriented Rock. This tune often strikes me as a pack up and go home tune. (like Baby Blue)\nSet Two\nIf you like Donna you should love this opener.\nThey just tear it up.\nRamble on- another tune that I don't often find in 2nd set. but the GSET, Ramble On works.\n\nAfter brief tuning they head straight for The Dark Star.\n\n a PITB groove just before they rode into El Paso.\nSpace out of El Paso is a mix of tuning and reminds me of that SPACE that used to come out Drumz on a good night in the 80's.\nGarcia in an interview stated that in later years it was the most creative part of the show. Not sure where people hear Morning Dew in there? \nOne thing is pretty certain , nobody saw DEAL coming.\nEverything after DEAL is gravy, 4 song encore.\nStrong Sugar Magnolia SSDD- a touch of Donna\nDig Half Step late in the 2nd set \n(Donna crosses the RIO Grande)\nUJB-well played but sans DJG\nSat Night-all hands on deck!",

While it's missing a truly great moment where everything transcends, Dark Star->El Paso->Space->Deal is the highlight of this one for me. Keith's piano was putting me in an old west saloon during that Deal, almost wish the show ended there with all the electricity buzzing, but the boys keep going and it's still damn good.",
