But there wasn't any other place we would have rather been. The Cold rain and Snow opener was out of this world and a Great rendition of Ramble On Rose. Bird song into Comes a time was timeless. Before The Music Never Stopped Bobby mentioned something about the crack equipment crews and continue our singing in the rain. Estimated/Terrapin and Morning Dew were some other favorites of mine from this show. It is definitely a must for your collection.",

This is not to say it is too prominent in the mix it is just that clean and clear. I do believe you can pinpoint the spot in Dew where Phil blows a speaker (it was still blown at merriweather and you can hear it on the AUD recordings). Speaking of Phil, for me the low point is Tom Thumb. I never would have thought another person on the planet could sing as bad as Bob Dylan (late 80's) but Phil blows him away. He is an awful singer now and then. Other than that it is a great show and the first set ending with 3 Jerry songs in a row shows how psyched he was at this show.",

Maybe it's the pristine sound quality and the availability of this one for years.  For me this show is a prime example of the abysmal low points Jerry was reaching during his darkest days.  His voice is shot, his playing is sluggish, and he doesn't seem to know where he is half the time.  The rest of the band is clicking pretty well, but nonetheless because of Jerry's condition, I find this one very depressing to listen to.  Thankfully he pulled himself out of it and had a few more great years in the late 80's.",

HOWEVER, this is an '80s show and does not fall under the rubric of perfection like '77.  for my money, i would argue that this show has more soul than most of may '77.  in fact, what '77 holds in perfection, an '85 show like this erases in passion.  seriously folks, this is a high water mark (not because of the pouring rain).",

That was the Hersheypark radio jingle in the 80s, and man did it ever ring true on this day.  We did the Park and what a long, strange day it was.  Parents with kids had no idea what to make of it and some were quite upset.  The park was overrun with blazed deadheads.  There was LOTS of sillycibin shrooms around and tons of LSD.  The Park was nuts.  Word of advice:  DON'T GO ON THE ROTOR (spins you centrifugally then the floor drops).  It almost ruined the night for 4 of us.  We sat on a bench from 3:00 pm until about 6:30 because of that damn ride (and everything we consumed).\n\nBy showtime we were just silly from everything we had eaten.  The ROTOR bad buzz had worn off and Cold Rain and Snow had kicked in.  What a great first set.  To us, we got a \"triple Jerry\" (Birdsong>CAT>Deal) which none of us even knew was possible.  That really made our 1st set.  Plus, Jerry in a blazer?  That was unique as well.\n\nBob comes out for the second set and tries to inform us of the crack equipment crew.  Dan Healy had other ideas and because of our state of mind, we just thought Dan's trickery was so funny and so cool.  I still think it's one of the best Music Never Stopped I've ever seen.\n\nI'm with the overrated crowd when it comes to the Tom Thumb Blues.  While you may like the novelty of it and think this version is good, it brought the energy of the show to a screaming halt. No one knew what it was, and I still don't think half the audience ever figured out that Phil sang it.\n\nThe Estimated Terrapin was really good but the Morning Dew stole the rest of the show.  I remember lots of grumbling over the Day Job encore as they were becoming far too frequent.  After the show, some girl came by selling \"No More Day Job\" buttons.  We gave her 9 yards of crap for her blasphemy, but deep down inside, we knew she was right.\n\nEveryone I know who went to Hershey and Merriweather thought Merriweather was better (I missed those shows).  I'm surprised this show gets the outrageous props it gets.  It's good, but it's not that good.",

Download it. \n\nThe venue was unique in that it seemed like a high school football field, complete with bleachers on either side of the field and a scoreboard behind the stage. It rained that whole day and I remember at one point in the intermission the crowd began calling for people to put their umbrellas down. The field was flat so the umbrellas were definitely obstructing the view. One by one, the umbrellas came down until there was literally one hold out left. It was funny deadhead moment when that last person finally relented and joined the rest of us in being soaked. The crowd erupted with an enthusiastic cheer of support. \n\nAnyway, birdsong->comes a time_> music never stopped first set closer. It is a classic. 5 STARS",

We came from the Saratoga NY show and there was construction on the Highway and we decided to take a short cut.  It may have been fewer miles but the speed limit was less and we went over some big mountains.  It didn't look like that on the map.  Out car was breaking down when we were seeing \"next exit 11 miles\" signs and when you got there it was just a road.  Nothing else.  We kept conking out and would get out and fix something and go another ten miles and conk out again.  Finally when an exit said there was a service sation 3 miles off the exit we took our chance.  Turned out to be the fuel filter which we did get fixed with help.  We finally got close to the show and there was a bad wreck that had traffic snarled near the entrance.  When we finally parked it was exactly show time.  I wasn't too worried because I knew the Dead were always late.  Then we got into the line or should I say mob to get in.  Only two gates to get in.  When we heard the band start it was a sad moment.  I never missed a song until then.  At least I could hear it until we got under concrete.  When we did get in there wasn't too many people in yet.  I still feel they should have held out a bit for people to get in.  After I relaxed it was fantastic.  Really smoking and the rain was warm and didn't even bother me.  One killer Estimated Prophet.  When they were playing Morning Dew there was a poignient keyboard piece and the rain tapered off and the moon came shined through the clouds. Everyone was mesmerized.",

      "review_text": "Ominous night in Pa. Anyone who thinks the boys took a night off here was probably at the show and obviously let the rain get to them, which can happen on a summer tour.  However, this show marks part of Dead history as one of the best back to back nights in different cities the boys ever did (with 5.7.77 and 5.8.77 leading the way--ofcourse, this is only my opinion).  The first set's cold rain (don't you know...DON'T YOU KNOW)! gives early notice that this is going to be a special night--and the three consecutive Garica songs to close the set (has this ever, and I men EVER, been done in the first set before?) cements the fact.  The Birdsong>Comes a Time>Deal moves directly into the history books, and is quite the trifecta--people must have thought they were dreaming...or something.  The Music>Tom Thumbs that opens the next set follows along with the ominous tone that's been set and is quite a second set opener, especially considering how rare Phil singing was back then.  The song of this show, however, is the Dew.  It's the most powerful short Dew that I know of and one of the best in terms of pure weight and unabashed force. Phil does things here that are only suited for seriously able-bodied adults of a very mature nature to hear.  It's somewhat terrifying.  Plain, thunderers fury.  Then follows  Brent's gorgeous, soft piano solo with Garcia's heart wrenching answers that bring us back to a beautiful place where we gather ourselved after the beating that we somehow felt we deserved. It is completely different from any of the epic versions of the previous decade...it is pure 85, and it you are into 85, then this dew will stay with you forever---as well will this show.  As good a sound as we have for this show.  I give it an A- cause it's 85 and the hiss is normal for that year.  It doesn't detract from the show for some weird reason.\nDstone5553@aol.com",

They took some chances...check out the placement of songs out of the normal rotation (ie Saturday Night to open the show in Ventura, Music>Eyes at Hershey's 2nd set, and the China>Riders, and Let it Grow>Deals that  closed out the first set at several shows...to name a few).\n\nAlso, while Jerry's health was failing...he was whaling on the axe. For those who have distain for his voice this year...play any Comes a Time or She Belongs to Me. He still could pour it out.\n\nThe band took chances in '85 and if you don't have them yet...give the shows a chance...you'll be amazed!!\n\nDavid",

Then follows the quintessential version of Tom Thumb's Blues, tighter than Dolly Parton's tie-dye.  The instrumental break in Thumb is one of the most intense and perfect the Dead have ever played (Brent!!).  The Estimated and Terrapin that follow aren't the longest or most perfect versions ever played.  Rather, they are short and extremely sweet.\n\nI'm not sure why the band wasn't up for lengthy expositions that day.  Perhaps the goony birds were coming on too strong or perhaps they just wanted to rock and roll instead of play noodle-dee-doo for three hours.

One of our taper friends named Garry came up to us in front of the board without his gear and then told us that Healy and crew let him patch his D5 into the board to keep it out of the rain.  (It was always fun to watch tapers when they did not have their equipment to monitor...no meters to set - they never knew what to do with themselves.)\n\nAnyway, after the show we head back to the hotel to dry off and hear the \"master board\" and we discovered the Not Fade Away was cut in the middle as they flipped the tape.  (not sure why they flipped here but beggers could not be choosers).  Anyway, we had 5 D5s stacked recording \"1st gen boards\" and I along with Garry had to pick the moment where we could hit pause on the recording, flip the tape and then trying to keep in beat, start recording again.\n\nYou can hear the finely executed splice at 5.51 of NFA.\n\nMy splice aside(if it is in fact mine), the recording quality of this is off the charts.

I feel that part of the music experience is the venue..and I loved getting down in the rain in Hershey,PA..The summer of 85' was a special time, even with Jerry off some nights..Most people..I didn't say all>will tell you that this was a good show and I'm one of those people.I always think of the families who traveled to Hershey for vacation and were surprised to see the circus was in town with freaks..Think of the stories they took home with them!! I got off on the madness and the meltdown in Hershey and enjoyed every minute of it..Three Jerry tunes to end 1st set..BAM..LOVE IT.One of my favorite Music Never Stopped with Healy effects..Healy was doing crazy shit all summer..Bobby,Bobby and You know what I means.This is a solid show with a interesting set list..I also like the sound of this board..so down with the Haters and please GIVE IT A WHIRL!!! Forever Grateful>Forever Dead",

      "review_text": "Wonderful World of Wonka was in Hershey. I was at this show on the grass maybe 12 rows back on Jer's side...having made the long wet overnight trek from Saratoga (my hometown). We're talking wet here folks!  Cats and dogs  with no break in sight. Wonderful smallish crowd  happy to be out in the rain to experience our favorite band in the land of Hershey. \n\nFirst of all, it always amazed me in '85 that when Jerry's voice was really struggling he made himself not only sing more songs- but more difficult ones!  This show epitomized his work ethic.  From Cold Rain on we could tell his voice was reaching the point of no return ...probably due to the weather ...and possibly feeling under the weather. Don't see Jerry in a blazer too often!  Hmmm?  My voice is rough ...so I'll sing 5 of the 7 first set tunes Bob. Love it!  \n\nMy first set  highlights are Comes a Time due do it's painful beauty and gorgeous guitar solo & Deal cause the end solo really smokes- though short. Second set Bobby re-assured us  that they're still \"singing in the rain\" (superfluous statement at best ;-)) ...before breaking into one of my favorite Music Never Stopped ever, followed by my favorite (by FAR!) Tom Thumbs Blues with Phil in his dog t-shirt. Listen how they \"share\" the space, weaving in and out of the available space provided. Never heard it played the same since.  Okay, the Dead are ON this set so let's enjoy the ride!  After nice playing thru drums/space, Phil plays the bass intro to The Other One ...only to discover its Miracle!  Nice recovery and worked out great (same key). Then the Morning Due. What can I say but Jerry's voice ...though raspy as hell sings it with sooooo much passion it still sends chills up my spine!  Phil's bombs blow a speaker in the climactic middle solo.... and this also has become my favorite Dew ever (yes I know about Cornell the great ;-)).  The rest of the show is solid through the Day Job, which I agree could have been replaced with something more profound after such a passionate show. But that's part of the beauty of this band. You just never know???\n\nExcuse the diatribe, but this is one show that really stands out for me among more than I can count or remember. Maybe it was everything combined; the sky in the second set that some claim illuminated a Steal Your Face for all to see (I didn't have THAT kind I guess but the sky was beautiful after the rain finally subsided), the music, chocolate, and whatever your choice of \"treat\" may have been for the show. \n\nThis SBD is very good!  I'm a MATRIX guy ....then great AUD ...then SBD if the others don't exist. THIS is a wonderful board, but beware: Phil's bass will scare you silly and may need to be tamed if the neighbors are cranky!  A great PEACE OF '85 DEAD so give it a listen and picture yourself rain soaked, stoned and happy to be in the land of Dead N' Chocolate!!!",

      "review_text": "Memories of Hershey Dead It was a dark and stormy day... \nwell not too stormy but enough rain to cause Bill to come out on stage prior to the festivities. As the crowd cheered his appearance he made a show of looking around at the cloudy skies and finally made a gesture that suggested it was too wet for a concert that day. The moist throng voiced our disapproval of his weather forecast as he retired to the enclave backstage and a good laugh was had by all.\n\nThis pic must have been made while Phil was singing Tom Thumb Blues (see photo's section of Dead.net) which was quite heavy for me as I and my concert going buddy Al were both out of our minds (and bodies.) I recall a tall gentleman, right in the middle of the crowd between the stage and soundboard putting his arms around his friends and he seemed to encompass 15 people with each arm.\n\nLater, during Not Fade Away I distinctly heard Bobby say, \u201cEverybody ready?\u201d at a point during the song intro when he was NOWHERE near his mic stand. I repeated his words to myself, under my breath and the dude in front of me turned around and put his forefinger to his lips and went \u201cShhhhh.\u201d This really blew my mind!!!\n\nThis was also the first show at which the pre show music selection really hit home for me. For some cosmic reason Healy played 'The Dark Side of the Moon' in its entirety and his choice provided the PERFECT \u201cset and setting\u201d for an incredible night of music and fun.\nGood Times!\n\nXOXOXOXO\nL/S",

      "review_text": "Two Tom Thumbs Up Interesting range of reviews below, from the pinnacle of experiences to trash.  I wasn\u2019t there but give this one 2 thumbs up.  First, got to love the memories of the overall experience - funny how something like rain can really galvanize things (I had my own rain pinnacle at 7/28/82 Red Rocks, will never forget it!).  And 1985 was a hot summer - I saw them at the Greek then later at Ventura.  Fun fun fun shows in which surprises abound!   Now for this show, the first set trio of Bird Song > Comes A Time > Deal is indeed incredible.  The Music Never Stopped is simply ripping.  The Dew is thunderous!  Along with the trippy Hershey Park environment and the cleansing rain, I\u2019m all in on this show!",

      "review_text": "i was there i was living in Hershey when this happened. This show converted so many people into deadheads in the area. Just yesterday I found a picture of my bright yellow  1966 rambler marlin with sidepipes somebody posted in a dead group! I remember that car melting in the rain with other witnesses. If we have to explain this show , you would never understand. There really are no words to describe the energy and love of that 1 day in our lives. I truthfully do not remember any of the music but i am sure i was dancing in puddles. Nice to hear the music 40 years later and remembering phil's best show. BTW Jerry never died. He lives inside all of us <3",
