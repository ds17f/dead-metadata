The VOJ is the best ever IMO, I really like the Foolish Heart, Music Never Stopped is very nice, Heck even the Truckin' is fun - Weir gets \"Truckin'\" and \"Busted\"  mixed up, so the result is \"Trusted down on bourbon street\". ;-)\n\nI was at this show and the energy in the first set was better than any show I had seen in years. The second set was very special from drums on. The nasty buzz at the end of sugar magnolia is a drag, but it's on every tape of this show I've heard in varying forms.\n\nIt's a show I listen to a lot, so I'm darn tempted to give it 5 stars, but the '95 stigma lives on....",

I have to aggree with the other reviewers who hold this one in high regard, as it is indeed one of the better shows of '95 and definitely has a whole lot more energy than the prevoius two nights at the Delta. From start to finish it is a fun show to listen to - Salt Lake City being a mega surprise, getting both band and fans into the mood. Garcia is playing pretty good for the period, with the exception of Samba In The Rain, which he never fully got his head around anyway. As already mentioned, Visions of Johanna is the true emerald of the evening, Jerry giving it all he's got! A recommended download for sure, despite the '95 factor.",

      "review_text": "Happy Birthday Vince As an initial matter, I *hate reviewers who qualify their postings with comments like \"I know it's 95 but ..\" or \"for 95 this isn't a bad show\".  I don't care if the show is '65, '75, '85, '95 or any other year in the history of the \"band beyond description\", a great dead show is a great dead show no matter when it was played.\n\nAll that said, this is a goddam great dead show.  Jer actually *allowed* Vince to play some leads in SLC, I'm guessing either because it was his birthday or perhaps it was the steady decline of JG's health and he wanted to take the night off.  Who knows?  I think Vince gets a bum rap from Heads.  He wasn't brent or keith, but he also wasn't the sack of you know what some people think he was and this night is a good example of what he brought to the table.\n\nThe first set is strong from start to finish, Bob and Vince really rip up Salt Lake City, Bob especially throwing out some nice leads and riffs over Vince's keys.  FOTD has some nice Vince piano work as Jerry cedes the floor.  Wang Dang smokes, they really had this tune going, and Vince clearly *got this tune unlike some others (i.e. Terrapin, Dark Star).  Phil plays a nice Broken Arrow, and while I much prefer So Many Roads in the 2d set, the song has a warmth and meaning, particularly in these later versions, that is impossible to ignore.  The band closes shop on set 1 with a strong Music Never Stopped. and the MNS is a great set closer.  Overally, 1 hr. of very strong playing, good set list, and the SLC bust out being the major highlight.\n\nSecond set offers more of the same.  Jerry just gets totally absorbed in the Foolish Heart jam, spiraling around his riffs endlessly, you'll be drooling at his guitar work.  While I'm not a huge \"Samba\" fan (who is?) this is actually a nice version of it, there's a slow, bluesy slinkiness to it, that Jerry builds through use of the midi pedal on his guitar in the intro to the song that sets a nice tone.  Vince delivers a strong vocal performance and again, not my favorite tune, but a good effort.  The Truckin>IJWMLTY>TWBS shows the band at a nice peak moment.  The jams are creative, the playing weaves through themes easily, and everyone seems to be on the same page.  Again, great dead music is great dead music, no matter when it was done.  The drums/space is great if you are a beam head (like me) who loves the trippy sounds Mickey got out of the beam.  The Visions speaks for itself, a few minor vocal hiccups for JG, but a really chilling version that he pours his heart into.  Sugar Mags and then a predictable Liberty close out the night. \n\nThe recording is a top notch SBD with the very minor, as the text file mentions, scratchy digi static at the end of a few tracks that can be cut out with Audacity or a similar program.  Also, for those who want to flip the encore to the first disc, you can fit all of set 2 on an 80 min. disc.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

This version of Visions is not as epic as most say, but a nice breakout none-the-less. And the comments about hearing Vince more were a bit scary. By the way, what was the occasion? he'd only been in the band 5 years. Good first set- especially since they had been doing the 40 minute ones lately. Second set has holes, but has a lot of great moments.",

This has got to be my favorite show of the year, the sound is better than average, it took a few tries to get an excellent copy, still don't have the copy that will make me stop searching but it is almost there.

Black-Throated has plenty of atmosphere to it, and So Many Roads is a top-ten version.  The snippets of 'I Just Wanna...' and 'That Would Be...' are a surprise, both songs turning into a bit of a Jerry-chant, very unusual.  'Visions' is quite good, not many screw-ups and 'Liberty' is even pretty good.  The entire show hangs together very well and there are many high points, all in all it has a good feeling to it and as all good shows, it seems like you've gone somewhere and come back again.

First time I heard it on Gans' show it brought me to tears.  Rest of the show is up and down like a yo-yo.  There are far worse Foolish Heart's (sorry to say) than this one by the way.  The Truckin' is no great hell.  The first set contains some pleasant moments---Jed among them.  Anyone notice that Jed's dog in this version is even smarter than usual?  Not only can he talk, he can also read!!\n\nI actually dig much of the first set more than the throwaway \"I Just Wanna...\" and another in an endless line of TWBS's that litter the second set.  The band could have done itself a favour early on when (I assume) Garcia initiated this bit of filler by adopting McCartney's original structure and funky drumming instead of this boring shuffle.\n\nThe Johanna though is peerless.  His vocal is among my favourites of his and that's saying something.  He really makes the song live in a way I only thought possible on Blonde on Blonde.

I also enjoy the song selection, though it does seem that the crowd had a hard time getting into the vibe.

I saw him up, down and inter-galactic and this show reflects a beautiful soul.  The life of a bard is not an easy one because a true artist never stands pat and never rests on their laurels.  Jerry G never did!\nFourth, Vince - never underrate him.  He was more a sideman than a core guy like Brent and Keith became, but he obviously loved being there.

I remember thinking at the time that this may have been a good time for an extended break, if not for the better part of two years like '74-'76, at least for a tour or two, a couple of seasons worth maybe. Time for the band to re-focus, rest, recuperate, concentrate on personal and health issues, etc., etc.,...\nSince the \"Touch\" record had come out, it seemed every tour the Band had been playing larger and larger venues-and finally making large CASH. A lot of the newer fans didn't care or notice, since it was all they had ever known of the Dead, but those of us who had been around on tour for quite awhile before that noticed that the scene had changed, and not for the better. The shows had changed too, as to be expected. Still the Good Old Grateful Dead up there, but more distant and less personal; there were fewer and fewer times that you got the feeling that the band was devoting their energy to playing their best. Fewer times you got that special feeling that they were playing just for you and the tribe, personally. This lack of energy seemed to increase, particularly over the last two or three years of the Dead's existence.\nAnyhow, blah, blah, (sigh), it seemed to me that when the Grateful Dead finally achieved big-time success, they just didn't know how to handle it.\nI give them kudos for resurrecting old and rarer tunes, as well as introducing some really good new material during these years (except most of those god-awful Phil songs...). But it wasn't quite enough, sorry. And I love the band, and kept going to shows-18 years of touring, 272 shows. (Get Sirius radio if you don't have it, it's worth the money just for the GD channel.)\nMy only comments show-wise in this rant is that it's not all that bad. Pretty damn good for a 1995 show in fact. And whoever said that this was a dull setlist couldn't be more wrong: plenty of interesting nuggets here, from the \"Salt Lake City\" opener, \"Wang Dang Doodle\", \"BT Wind\", and the triple threat of Jerry's \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\", \"That Would Be Something\" and \"Visions of Johanna\" that form the meat of the second set: none of these are anywhere close to common tunes for the Dead of this time period-or played at the same show in any period of the group's existence.\nWhew, glad I got that off my chest!",

At that point in time my group of buddies and I were into lots of other bands, none of which looked or sounded like the Dead, but we had open minds and an eagerness to partake in the festivities! \n\nThe 1st night was fun as hell, but we were having such a good time enjoying the parking lot scene we never actually made it into the concert. Side note: Fatty egg rolls, beer, and other goodies make for some memorable times. :)\n\nAt the last second on the second night we scored some nose bleeds and made our way into the Delta Center. The smell of incense was thick and everyone was in a fantastic mood, but honestly the band was a bit off that night. The sound wasn't great, but that could easily be attributed to my shitty seat location. Still a lot of fun, but I can honestly say I was a little underwhelmed. \n\nThe next morning I had to wake up early and work all day. I had no intention of heading back to SLC that night, but my best friend insisted, so I said what the hell, let's do it. At the last second some really good seats fell into our laps. We doubled up on the chemicals and made our way inside. From the beginning of the set you could tell something was different. There was a buzz in the air, and the band was energized and on top of their game. Things got a little sideways for me during the drums/space considering everything coursing threw my veins, but then Jerry started to pluck the first few notes of VOJ, and a calmness fell over me and I became hyper focused. I'd never heard anything like that before, and it definitely grabbed my attention. I've listened to this version of VOJ thousands of times since that night and the beauty of it never gets old. \n\nThe band transitioned right into one of the best versions of SM I've ever heard. Bobby was spot on and the hooting at the end was AWESOME! The boys finished with a fantastic version of freedom and that was it, I was hooked. A friend gave me a copy of the show a few months later and I listened to it until the cassette wore clean out. \n\nIts been roughly 26 years since that week and I doubt if there's been a day that has gone by that I don't listen to the band. I'm sure it's corny to hear, but that week changed my life. This isn't the greatest show the band ever played, but it has some fantastic moments and will always be special to me.",
