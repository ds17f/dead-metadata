In the grand scheme of all Dead shows, I guess this can be considered a solid show, but given the month and year, it is definitely lacking in comparison to its relatives.

I think buffalo is superior as is 4/22/77  for the song, But in my opinion labeling those two as better than this has much to do with how keith played, adding texture.  Here on 5/5 jerry's playin sounds exceptional, he seems to be in a groove with the travis bean. Most everything else of the show is safe or off beat and uninteresting to me.  consider the scarlet fire is quite similar to barton hall, only not as good, same goes for estimated, better heard from the 18th of may and later, \n\n5/8 is often accused of sounding scripted and studioesque, I'd argue this is even more stale, I guess because there are no surprises on this night, it is exactly what is wrong with 77 dead, amidst so many other rights, including 6/9/77  5/8/77 5/9/77",

You can find at least eight to ten shows in the month of May that could become one of your all time favorite Grateful Dead concert recordings. This is one of those shows, my friends. \nSecondly, the sound of this BBD reel is top notch. You can crank it UP and play it over and over and over and still come back for more.\nThird reason to download: set list and performance of key songs. While there is always room to argue which Scarlet~Fire is the best ever, there's a reason why the powers that be put this Scarlet~Fire as filler on the 02-26 Swing Auditorium show you probably already downloaded from this blessed cornucopia of music files, the Archive. Because it's freaking good, that's why! But this show offers you more than just a few stand-out songs. The entire line-up is full of great versions of fan favorites besides Scar~Fire: Sugaree, Peggy-O, LL Rain, Music Never Stopped, Estimated, Sugar Mag, etc. Here is a prime example of the saying <i>'the whole is greater than the sum of the parts'</i>. You put all of these performances together and you have a fantastic show. It's called synergy and the Dead wrote the book on it. Get this and find out for yourself.",

Initially some songs don't get noticed but then they grow on me and like the petals of a flower begin to unfold and reveal it's beauty. Thats how it was for me for this song. It's interesting that the captain's name in this ballad is William because Jerry's maternal grandfather's name was Bill and he was a Norwegian ship captain. Betcha didn't know that. Hence, the ship of fools ballad and Jerry's predilection with Peggy O. Read the book he wrote just prior to his death in 1995 for this and other seminal information about dear sweet Jerry. \n\nHe lives on with all of you in all of his music.

Shows from this and surrounding years scream definative sounds from our favorite band. They have so much to offer. Perfect harmonies, Jerry and Bob's interplay and tight thundering bass and drums. Not to leave Keith behind as his sound in this era was the perfect and I say perfect match. This show is what a Grateful Dead Concert IS. Thick lows and off the chart highs. To bad I was 9 years old. Give this one a listen folks.",

Every shot went in and it looked so easy. I love these 1977 concerts. Sometimes there are other nights from a few years earlier that I prefer on any given night. For all New Haven doesn't give you it's still a 5 star performance. Perhaps not quite as exquisite as a few of the other shows during that period.  I have no doubt, however, that if you were there you would have walked out saying \"now that was great.\"",

Its the spring of 1977 and the boys are showing what they are made of from start to finish on 5/5/77. \nFirst set highlights include one of the nice long Sugarees, Music Never Stopped with a crazy jam ending the first set and Peggy-O with Jerry in fine voice.\nThe second set opens with a ripping Bertha and from there goes right into the meat of the show with Estimated into a beautiful Scarlet-Fire and then the climax of the show with St.Stephen. The jam in it is incredible. 5/5/77 might not be one of the most popular for the month of May but the St.Stephen and Peggy-O make this a must listen!",

The difference is subtle.  On 5/7, the significant counterpoint to Jerry\u2019s guitar (my opinion, of course) is Keith\u2019s piano, especially at the end of the tune.  On 5/5, Bob\u2019s guitar is higher in the mix than Keith\u2019s piano.  Consequently, based simply on preference, my vote is for the 5/5 version, though they\u2019re both gems.  And great, great Sugaree, Scarlet/Fire and others this night.  Superb guitar work and seamless blend among all the boys, vocally and instrumentally. Fantastic night!  Definitely a 5 star show.

Still, this show has two must hear performances in Sugaree and St. Stephen. The Sugaree, though not the legend of 5/19/77 (probably the best ever) is one of the most beautiful and emotive performances of the year. And the lengthy St. Steve is a total rocker, peaking with a shredding climax from Jerry that strongly suggests Truckin', but instead heads back to the verse before segueing into a nice Sugar Mag.

This jam is what made me fall head over heels in love with the Grateful Dead and Jerry's incredibly unique style and phrasing. This jam is a prime example of what makes the Dead so goddamned special. It's not super long, but it's extremely well executed.\n\nThe rest of the show is killer as well... This is May '77 after all. We'll, except for Lazy Lightning... Still can't get behind that one.",
