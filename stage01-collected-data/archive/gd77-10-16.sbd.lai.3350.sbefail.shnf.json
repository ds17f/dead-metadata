      "review_text": "Awesome 1st show I will use this forum to document the goings on at this show, rather than parse versions of various songs.  I was attending Tulane at the time and the Dead were avoiding N.O. like the plague, so Baton Rouge was the closest they would come.  When the show was announced, all my friends pounced on reserved tickets and those seats were long gone.  Me and my close music buddy decided at the last minute to go to the show, and we had to \"settle\" for general admission tickets.  We were feeling pretty - um, er... chemically enlightened - as we showed up and got tickets.  I was confused how a basketball arena could sell both reserved and general admission tickets, but whatever.\n\nTurns out that the bozos who bought reserved tickets had seats in the stands, while the maybe 200 people who bought general admission tickets ended up wandering around on the floor RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE!!!  There were these nazi-like student ushers preventing the reserved ticket holders from going down to the floor, so in summary, 200 people had the run of the floor of a major college basketball arena all to ourselves.  My friend and I just lied down on our backs right in front of the stage and stared up into Bobby's eyes while he launched into the most stirring version of Terripin I've ever heard - it was a good thing.  Almost like a private showing, and in the penultimate year of 1977 no less!\n\nMy favs from this show - a killer version of Cassidy (a song that either worked for them or didn't, no in between), a very nice Sunrise by Donna, a rather mellow, solid Scarlet/Fire, a top 10 Estimated and a great Terripin.  As a whole, this was a mellow, laid back show, I believe because of the crowd situation directly in front of the band.  But the playing is superb, and I was definately hooked walking out of the show.",

Why did they ever go away from Betty?  I wish I could have heard these shows live to compare with the 80's.  If it sounded anything like this on stage (as opposed to the 80 and 90's soundboards, it's no wonder they played so well.  On-stage sound reinforcement can make or break a show.",

Lo and behold, the fall is just smoking hot too.   \n\nWhat a great show this is to listen to.  The sound quality is excellent.  Bobby's playing is really well featured in the mix.   The Sugaree is a top 5 and the Minglewood earns some strong consideration.\n\nThe down side to Spring of '77 is that we don't get The Other One or Black Peters.  They make up for that in spades in the fall though.   The Scarlet-Fire solid too, not spring hot but really nice.\n\nI give this 5 Grams",

      "review_text": "Very good question A previous commenter asked a very good question.  The recording mixing for the second half of the year, after the June Winterland Run, was different.  Maybe they didn't use a Betty Board (or Betty Cantor) for the last run of the year?  The main problem I have with just about every show after June 1977 is Keith is mixed in way too high.  He overpowers the other musicians.  It's hard to find a good soundboard after 6/1977.\n\nThis particular show has an excellent recording but I hear too much Keith!  Damn!  Every show from this time will be an average of 3/5, this show will be 4/5, but there cannot be a 5/5.  It's disappointing.",

LSU Assembly center then was a 5 year- old domed basketball facility built with fine acoustics in mind. The Stones had began their 75 tour there with 2 shows..one at 3:00 PM & a 2'nd at 9 & we got The Who later that year (I couldn't sleep for 2 days following that show). The Floyds stopped by in 77 as well. The 14,000 seat LSUAC sold about 5,000 seats for GD so it was set up theatre-style as i recall. And make no mistake..there were PLENTY of first-timers there that night...folks who were just getting beyond the curious stage...as to why some of their friends kept dropping everything to attend GD 'events'. And as i'm fond of pointing out for some reason..Lynyrd Skynyrd were to be the next act at LSUAC on the 20'th and as we know their plane only made it as far as southern Mississippi.\nBTW it was good to see selected songs from this show included in the new compilation release @ Dead.net",

Usually Jerry's soloing on this song is powerful, but in a more jazzy, lilting kind of way (if that makes sense- the Dead are one of the only bands I know of who can be quiet but intense) but this version Is just a brutal attack from start to finish, especially the 1st solo.  It's a must hear version. Rest of the show solid too with strong versions of Music Never Stopped and Scarlet>Fire, among others.",

Being a professional guitarist who has seen the boys over 300 times and has a distinct ear for guitar tones, I would have to say that Jer used the Wolf guitar at this show.  Officially, Englishtown on 9/3 was the last show where he used the Travis exclusively.  That being said, give a listen to another grate show a little over a year later, Nashville 12/16/78, and you will hear what, IMHO, is highly likely Garcia playing the Travis.

      "review_text": "Red Pole <br />The Maravich Assembly Center holds 14k - a big venue for the Dead in Louisiana in 1977 - but they apparently set up for half the floor. Note that this was the triage center for Katrina. The 1st set is fairly short for '77, at just over an hour, though the quality makes up for it. You don't see Baton Rouge pop up on fave lists, but there sure is a lot of good stuff here.\n\nFirst Set. It takes a few to warm up. <i>Sugaree</i> may be one of the longest versions (almost a long as 5/28), but it's far from the most engaging. It starts downtempo, suddenly slows more during the second chorus, then gets even slower until it sounds like they're nodding off. <i>Cassidy</i> is better, and the machine has verified lift-off with <i>Loser</i>. There are many good  versions in '77, but check Donna on this one. The sky then turns paisley for a hot <i>Minglewood</i>, and by <i>Friend of the Devil</i> they are playing in the pocket. There's a deceptive mellowness on what are not super-excited versions, but let it settle - and don't forget to listen to Bobby. On <i>Sunrise</i>, Jer & Bobby have both found their chunk; and Donna is great here, too (better than the one used on <b>RT1-2</b>). <i>Dire Wolf</i> is very tight. These '77s are straightforward and brief, but few are this solid. <i>Music Never Stopped</i> is equally inspired, and much like the Denver version.  \n\nSecond Set. <i>Scarlet</i> is good, but in retrospect it's a lead-in for one of the era's best versions of <i>Fire on the Mountain</i>. The former has \"one of those feelings\" instead of \"flashes\" and \"nothing wrong with the way she caught my eye\". Maybe not the tightest but damned if Jer doesn't locate magic and commune with the three-eyed godhead. The latter is concise and gets effortlessly to the point in each lead. The final jam sent me left at the lights. The official version of Scarlet starts abruptly, without the count-in. <i>Estimated</i> is solid, if typical '77. The official version fades out before the last 30sec, but that's nothing compared to how the following <i>Drums</i> was chopped. There are nine edits (some quite bizarre), ultimately using these sections of the SBD: 0:09>0:38, 0:52>1:04, 1:34>2:00, \t\t2:06>2:11, 2:36>3:13, 3:49>3:53, 4:05>4:07, 4:11>4:23, & 4:53>end. This <i>Other One</i> has the conciseness of Fire, and is likewise one of the year's best (up there with  5/9, 5/21 & 6/8). It's a punchy, interlocked mosaic on a wall that evolves to trompe-l'\u0153il. Just one verse and a Spanish segue into <i>Good Lovin</i>. It's then weird to hear that one go into <i>Terrapin</i>. These are average versions (Jer forgets several verses), but this is the only one of the latter that goes into <i>Black Peter</i>. Since Peter is laid-back like much of the show, it seems like a long way to go to the jam, but the payoff is wealthy and it has one of the longest and best trannies ever, going into <i>Around & Around</i>. This has some shoes in the dryer but the real trainwreck is saved for the encore, with all verses flubbed, made worse by going out of tune.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nMinglewood Blues - paisley sky\nFriend of the Devil - in the pocket & Bobby\nSunrise - space for Jer and Bobby \nDire Wolf -  '77 terseness & Donna\nMusic Never Stopped  - inspiration equal \nFire on the Mountain - to-the-point each lead & final jam \nOther One - mosaic & trompe-l'\u0153il  \n\nSOURCES: The tunings are trimmed from the only SBD (lai_3350).
