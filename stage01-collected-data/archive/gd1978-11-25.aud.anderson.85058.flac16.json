The make-up show started with a Shakedown which was a \"I told ya I'll be back\" reassurance for us Jersey Freaks, this and the Springfield 1-15th were great times",

I called the house, told them my sob story and they said I could pick one up at will call.  My mom dropped me off and I had my first experience of trying to get into a Dead show dosed with no ticket!  Suddenly, everyone was leaving the building and I scored an 11th row center ticket from some head who could not return for the make up.  Next, I see the crew I suspected of breaking into my room and stealing my ticket during a party.  I laughed so hard I thought I'd die.  I boarded the southbound train the only happy head to see them cancel.  My mom picked me up at the station just as I was coming down and I remember having a blast playing foosball with my older brothers friends debating Springsteen vs. Jerry.  The make up on 1-17-79 was my 2nd show and being up front blew mind. The dbag that stole my ticket got busted for weed before the show and his friends were in the nose bleeds. Karma.",

Rather people were concerned for Jerry's health.\n\nThe upside was an outstanding tour in Jan of 79.\nWas able to go both Philly, MSG and Nassau shows as well as the make up for this show. 1/10/79 was the return of Dark Star to the east coast and the St. Stephen is outstanding.\n\nThe funny part was that the make up show for this cancellation was my least favorite show of the Jan 79 tour!",
