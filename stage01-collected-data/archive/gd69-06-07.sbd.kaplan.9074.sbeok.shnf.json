The dynamics shift nicely and often. Though it's not at all spacey, it's as close as the Dead get to actual jazz without playing be-bop standards. A good, honest version.",

There was no advanced notice that Janis Joplin was going to perform that night, so when she stepped out from between the curtains behind the drums, that place went absolutely berserk! The few people who were still sitting on the floor were now on their feet. She stood to the left of Garcia, both enthusiastically charged for the occassion to do \"Love Light\" together. Sweating profusely two minutes into her performance, and wearing a pinkish outfit (CLEARLY sans bra), she was so animated that the Dead almost faded into the background. I've been looking for a chance to hear this clip for 37 years ... thanks for allowing me to re-live this wonderful concert. I believe I still have the handbill from this concert as well; I saved them ALL!\nTwo years after this performance, that wonderful voice was gone... followed by Pigpen's soon after.",

True, the notes describe what looks like the same songlist, they also place the venue as Carousel Ballroom. In addition, if you look at the URLs on that site for show notes, it uses the form \"yearmonthday\", i.e., 680607 as the file name for each image. And, in fact, the URL for that page IS 680607. And on June 7, 1968 they played Carousel Ballroom (though Deadbase shows only St. Stephen --> Darkstar as songs that were played). So, the date in the URL matches the venue that he lists, but while the song list looks like it might have been the 2nd set of the 69 show, it's far from complete.\n\nI guess the bottom line is that Dick's site raises more questions than it answers. So, while I'd like to trust the guy just because of who he is, his site raises more questions than it answers.\n\nHaving said all that, the show seems excellent -- an old, late generation tape, and not nearly as crisp & present as many others of its vintage, but the playing and the presence of Janis make it a must-have, IMO.\n\nHey now!!",
