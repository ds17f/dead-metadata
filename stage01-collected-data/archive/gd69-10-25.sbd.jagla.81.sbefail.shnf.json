Phil is blasting through it like a freight train with so much melodic energy - the playing at around 4 minutes with jerry and phil crossing ascending and descending solos - just amazing.

So before this recording, there are a bunch of crappy AUD tapes of shows that might or might not be good if you can stand to listen, interrupting a long line of nice SBDs. I wonder what happened in that period? Certainly Garcia's rig sounds totally different from before the murky period of around September 1969 (the first autumn of my very weird life, incidentally): it's WAY brighter and crisper sounding. Did Bear put a buffer in the Gibson SG, or is this the first clear recording we have of Garcia playing a Strat?",

      "review_text": "Dark Star BENCHMARK This show overall compares favorably to the Dick's Picks Vol. 2 performance from the Ohio Theatre.\n\nSpecifically, the Dark Star for me is perfection. There are none of the exploratory fits and starts and complete \"meltdowns\" of later years - which are great - but can sometimes distract from the enjoyment that a very complete piece of music can provide. The jamming is fast, coherent, and starting at about 11 mins my ears start to tingle as the epic crescendo builds to a fabulous spine tingling guitar-gasm just after 15:00. More than once I have had this on quietly for background in my office and had people just incredulous that they could actually \"LIKE\" Grateful Dead music!\n\nArthur Schopenhauer is quoted as saying: \"Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.\" I promise this Dark Star is completely OUT OF SIGHT.\n\nAs for the rest of the songs - this is still early enough in their career that you can hear and feel how absolutely dedicated the band is to deliver their best to the audience. They are HUNGRY and so obviously at the height of their creative ability. There is a wonderful energy present throughout, and like others I just have to add that the sound quality is incredible for a 1969 recording. Over Airplay to my Denon receiver + JBL speakers it sounds like they are all playing in my living room! Just unbelievable, and the world is so lucky to have this show available to enjoy whenever and wherever there is internet! \n\nWe are also treated to a fantastic showing by Stephen Stills in Lovelight, who seems to have an excellent musical rapport with the band, and although Pigpen's voice is mixed a little faintly it still shines beautifully.\n\nFIVE DARK STARS",
