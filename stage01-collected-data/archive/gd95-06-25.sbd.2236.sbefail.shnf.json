He wrecked Wharf Rat at that one, perhaps prompting them to throw us the proverbial bone of Lucy in the Sky that night. On the 25th, however, he nailed it, and I was blissful. \nI wanted Bruce to completely push them into Dancing in the Streets (even though I despise the song) during Shakedown - listen to the jam and tell me you don't hear it. \nthe Rain-Run to start the second set was pretty cool, and I thoroughly enjoyed my first Ship of Fools, spotty as it was. Damn, I even liked Samba that night. \nPlus, the Jerry/Dylan pairing at the end of Dylan's set was great - I think they did Train to Cry, and Rainy day Women. \nAnyway, it's probably the 2nd best show of the year, after 3/18/95.

Despite that, and despite the fact that it's not a very good show, it's probably one of the better 95 shows. Does anyone remember Jerry's demeanor onstage this night? Was he visually communicating with the Band or Bruce, or was he standing stock still, staring at the ground? This is one of the tell-tale clues as to whether he was using on this tour, and as well, will explain a lot about his lack of interplay with others, his interest in the music or lack thereof, his moods, his interaction with the rest of the band, his inability to remember lyrics, etc. As well, Jerry at this point had acquired some pretty serious Carpel Tunnel in his hands, and according to Hornsby, he really wasn't practicing much guitar anymore at this point. Check out Blair Jackson's book on Garcia entitled \"Garcia: An American Life\". It is really well written and incredibly informative. Jerry was one troubled and damaged individual, and IMHO, it is truly miraculous that these guys made it into the 90's at all. Boy, am I glad they did.",

I've been listening to it a \"little bit here and little bit there\" for years, but never in its entirety- \"Picasso Moon\" was a quite painful.  I remember screaming at the show, \"Oh, NO!! NO!! NO!!\" and I relived that moment again when it came roaring through my speakers... it's a wonder it didn't tear them apart.  My God.  Ugh, what the Hell was Bobby thinking?!  Anything but that... anything.  If you were there, it was a killer, and you know damn well it was a killer.  \nSadly, my very last show... ever.  I hate that, God, how I hate that.  RFK was always without a doubt one of the better venues on the East Coast, and yes is was \"a real good time\" like always... Dylan; Dylan & Jerry; the Dancin' teaser during Shakedown (yeah, I heard it, too); Loose Lucy (my all time favorite... still makes me smile); Box of Rain; and sadly, the final Wharf Rat.  \"Smacker\" of a show, so-to-speak.  Read some of the \"reviews\" below... they were there, they know all too well.  \nI highly recommend this... probably one of the better shows of all 1995.  Just watch out for that Picasso Moon... it'll make you just cringe, I promise.  That's what Bobby should have closed the first set with was Promised Land, but no... it had to be Picasso f*#@ing Moon.\nGlad to have been there... still couldn't beat 3/18 in Philly.  For me, that was it, and for one reason, and one reason only- I'm still in complete disbelief that I actually got to see Jerry play \"Visions of Johanna\"... what was it, twice in 1986?  That should have been the \"talk of the tour,\" but Unbroken Chain stole all the glory.  I was there on 3/19 for that \"monumental event\" as well, but I still go and on about \"Visions\" the previous night to this day.  Just simply incredible.. holy cow.",

      "review_text": "A Nostalgic Show Writing about this show some 11 years after it took place is sort of weird, but also fulfilling. I attended this performance. It was my first and last show. \n\nI was 16 and had been \"into\" the Dead's music for quite some time-mostly via my mother's albums. At age 15 I probably really kicked into Dead mode, listening to as many albums as I could purchase possible.\n\nThen I had my first opportunity to see the Dead. And I jumped on the chance along with two very good friends. The parking lot was amazing-a far cry from the scene of Redskins games that I went to every year since age 5. I remember a U-Haul truck with the back door slid open and the back being filled with huge nitrous tanks. There was one truck with a makeshift hot tub in the back and people partying. And of course there was topless chick's running about. \n\nThe show itself was odd for me. I didn't have the band's catalogue memorized by then, so I only heard familiarity in songs, but not a note-for-note, lyric-by-lyric understanding. \"Shakedown\" had me guessing \"when will they play the next song? This is going on forever.\" But we didn't care, it was so much fun. \"Box of Rain\" was a fave tune of mine, so that was nice, as well as the Beatle's \"Rain.\" \"Space/Drumz\" was a mindfuck--we really didn't know what was going on then. And of course we thought it was the greatest when everybody was clapping and singing \"Not Fade Away\" after the band left the stage. \n\nWithin a week, I had the show tapes in my hand--my first Dead tapes. It was the start of something big in my life. And then the news hit just over one month later. Absolutely devastating. \n\nBut I'll always listen back on this show as something very powerful and special--at least to me. \n\nNow, armed with a loyality to the Dead's legacy and music that has spanned some 12 years, I think I can dish out a rating on this show. 3 stars: one for the playing, one for the crisp board, one for the fun of it all.",

      "review_text": "Not bad, but only relative to other '95 My last show, after starting in '77. This was not a good show. But the night before was so incredibly god-awful that this one was pretty good in comparison. Jerry looked like death the night before - totally un-engaged, just staring at the floor and barely going through the motions. \n\nFor this one, he was out in the wings of the stage enjoying Dylan's set and he seemed engaged in the music for the whole show. His playing had deteriorated pretty badly by then, but he at least had some spirit going for this show and was TRYING to play. Smiled a fair amount even. Seemed to be enjoying playing with Bruce again. No real specific comments - I just remember feeling slightly optimistic during and after this show after feeling like it was ALL over the night before. The Brokeback was a typically moving encore and a fitting last moment with the boyz.",

      "review_text": "Why the Hatred and Judgement Why r there so many haters out there? The Dead were what you made of them. I was just glad they made to my hometown to party one more time. They were the first ones to do what they did and they showed up a lot when they could have cancelled. A lot of people seem to want it their way and only that way. I remember my first trip to Cal Expo and Shoreline and my crew was talking about how they hated all the Brent stuff and how the coast was cheesy because the shows were not as fiery as they were in the east. I was just glad to be waking up in Half Moon Bay and getting to go to a party every day. I don't think the Dead judged us, so why should we gauge them when everyday was a different day?",

      "review_text": "Good Summer 95 Show This was a solid show during a very uneven summer East Coast Tour. The best part of the evening occured before the Dead even took the stage. Dylan performed an awesome set and capped it off by inviting Garcia to join in for the encores. Garcia provides some great fills and really seemed to be enjoying himself - even flashing Dylan a thumbs up at the end of the performance. As far as the Dead go, first set is well-played and energetic. Some have criticized the opening Shakedown but I kind of like it. Its no 6/30/85 but Garcia manages to pull together a slow, shuffling groove that leads to some nice places. I wasn't very impressed with the song selection in the pre-drums section of Set Two - but there are some good versions of the songs that are played. Show ends strong with beautiful renditions of Wharf Rat and Brokedown. Unfortunately, one of my former roommates was killed following the show (he was driving the van involved in the accident mentioned below - see \"Mystery of Jason and the Carolines.\") The encore subsequently took on a whole new meaning.",

      "review_text": "You gotta dig Picasso moon is a trainwreck because it is designed that way. Look at picasso's so-called art. Defined musically by the dead, they juxtapose a steady, droning, drumbeat, often screaming and contradictory lyrics, fill-in guitar leads that rarely follow any time signature, dueling keyboard sounds that are inharmonious, in short, Picasso defined in sound. Possibly musical genius, more likely cacophony. Take it for what you will.\nBTW- Shakedown is not too bad. Loose Lucy sounds good to me. Box of Rain is standard. Rain, to me, is miscast as a GD song, therby sucking. Wharf Rat is good is your in the mood. Nice and soulful. Like any later-day dead show, you gotta dig for the good stuff.",

      "review_text": "My last show.... Yes its true the end was near. I loved these RFK \"90\"s shows though. Still this show has some moments. The Shakedown opener is played confidently. Bob especially does some great work here. The Jack-a-roe blazes irregardless of what year it was. Its one of the more faster paced versions I have seen and it holds up here. Mama Tried also carries this momentum as this version cooks. Loose Lucy is strong and punchy and the Picasso Moon set ender really smokes. The band sounds tight even if all the voices are not quite what they once were. This Picasso Moon is a great version especially considering its \"95\". However the energy for the second set dipped a bit from the first set. Despite this Phil does an admirable job on Box of Rain with good playing behind him. Truckin picked up the energy and is a decent version with Bob spitting on the first row. I don't care for Samba and would have preferred anything else going into Drums. Wharf Rat meanders a bit as Garcia gets his legs but it holds together for a decent version. Brokedown is fitting since the Dead would never play here again.",

      "review_text": "Dylan and Garcia I can remember standing up and looking at a sea of people behind me in highgate. I was very close to the front for dylans set and Jerry and Phil were just chillin on the amps watching Dylans set and Jerry had this big ol' grin on his face...you could tell he was stoked to have his idol opening up for them again. If you have seen Dylan play a few times in a row you understand that he basically plays the same set night after night with a few differnt tunes tossed around. Dont get me wrong i love dylan and see him every chance i get, but i remember after seeing him in highgate and that great set he played i was hoping to see him switch up the set like the dead but the sets remained the same. So on this night i was going to skip his set all together becuz i had seen the highate, the meadowlands and the first night in RFK but something told me to check it out. I am glad i did cuz when Jerry came out to finish Dylans set it was just strait up legandary. The whole arena was shaking during rainy day women and Jerry was smiling and stoked to be out there. Who knew it would be the last time these two would ever grace the stage together , another great memory...thank you Jerry and company for a great ride. As far as the deads set goes i have seen alot better shows but it wasnt bad.",

As my earlier review of Highgate pointed out Garcia was a shell of his former self by this time.-Just had gotten out of prison for doing business w a 'brother' who turned out to be an undercover.I still had that huge chip on my shoulder prison mentality-Don't tread on me Fo' real! Highgate show was depressing..@ earlier review, it was  indeed wonderful seeing Jerry w/Dylan again. And listening to it now it wasn't the worst show..unfortunately those unfortunate souls who sold us that bad acid had ruined my perspective. It took me and my terrible attitude threatening them and then actually throwing there grilled cheeses on the ground to get our money back. -I miss Jerry!",

After brent checked out that was the end of the grateful dead.If i am asked about th'90's My answer is that i am trying to 4get them.I will say that this show was the among the 3 or 4 shows that had energy from start to end and again i did not like post brent music.This night garcia looked happy didn't use that horrible lame and weak midi.It was nice to see jerry come out for bobs set for a minute there i think i saw garcia smiling,and to see him smiling and grooving i was happy for him because he looked like he was having fun which was something he did not have with the grateful dead.He looked bored and sounded bored and the music was both boring and so lame.This was the last time i saw jerry alive.

'Rain' is still my favorite version, and post-drums - while flawed - is just brutal and amazing given the situation at the time.  The 'grey man' gives everything he's got - and it still makes me cry when I listen to it, both out of profound sadness for what could have been - and great joy for what was and will be.",

The loss of Jerry and the dispersal of the band was a great loss to the fans and the end of an iconic period band that had captured the hearts of many. The Grateful dead instilled many memory's with friends and family and in my mind has captured a time we all wish we could get back to. In essence there is always a time in ones life that we look back too and this was one of them. I still Laugh and smile and I'm happy to say that I was there to experience such a wonderful gathering. Thank you to all the people that have put this music in a place that it can be shared and enjoyed by all. Peace and good fortune to all you fans out there young and old. ",
