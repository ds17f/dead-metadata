This is a smoking hot show from 1971, which was a tumultuous year without a real set touring schedule.  They played this show (along with the night before) at the Palladium and just blew the roof off.  Pig is great on this one, sad to think of what happened so soon afterwards.  And listen for the \"Weather Report Suite\" tease late during the Space Jam after \"The Other One.\"  A very hot show, a very hot AUD, a very unique snapshot of Grateful Dead history.  A must have recording.  Essential.",

What kind of taping equipment did this guy have in 1971? This sounds better than most AUD 1980's shows I've heard!! A fairly short show, but good things come in small packages. Every song is played with high energy and conviction.The Hard to Handle is legendary, the Cumberland is bluegrass on acid, and the Brokedown is stellar. But the St. Stephen, Truckin>Other One jam is just unbelieveable. And the Morning Dew and Lovelight are icing on the cake. A jam packed little show that will change your opinion of AUD tapes. A must have for 1971. I hesitate to give 5 stars to an AUD show, but read what Mr. Latvala says about this show in Deadbase.Helpful hint-adjust your EQ on your stereo a little, boost the bass, light a bowl of Cheerios and you'll enjoy this just as much as any SBD show from 1971!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

The band is on fire, storming through two sets of classics with incredible energy. Just listen to the transition from The Other One into Me & My Uncle, just magic. The sound is fantastic, you wouldn't believe this is an audience recording from 1971! This is an essential piece of rock'n'roll, download highly recommended. If I had to give away all my Dead stuff but one show this is the one I'd keep.\nAlso check out the New Riders set from the same date, which is also available in the Archive, pretty hot either.",

In 84, the Dead created a taper's section but Deadheads still couldn't hope to get such a good sound as this, even 13 years later. This could be released as a DP and would have acceptable quality for that type of release. \nAnyway, the performance also is excellent. 1st set decent, but just a warm-up for the 2nd. The Truckin>Drums>Other One>M&MU>Other One is transportative as hell and must have been a blast to see in person...but the recording is so good that if you put it on a good stereo system and cranked it, it would be just like being there.

After this show I had to try for a copy. He gave me a phone number which I called three days later, and three days after that and $13.00 later I had two reels of this show which should be in everybody's top three. It was over 100 in LA that day and at least that inside the Palladium. After St. Stephen, Jerry Bob and Phil all walked to their mikes and said something of which nothing is legible. Perfect chemistry that night. Definitely the best I ever saw! ENJOY!!!",

What a climax. It's up there with the jam at the end of the Playin' from 5/26/72 as one of my favorite Dead peaks of all time. \n\nListen carefully for Bobby's short Weather Report tease when they go back into the Other One after Uncle. \n\nMy only knock of this show is the \"woo woo\" guy who won't stop wooing all through the show, especially during Casey Jones where he woo woos at the end of every single line Jerry sings.  It's stuff like that that makes me prefer soundboards. I'm all for enthusiasm, just not too close to the taper's mics.",

I had seen the boys maybe one other time before ('68 or '69 at the Shrine with Spirit and Country Joe) and just hadn't \"gotten it.\"\n\nThis show changed all that, big time. An utterly incendiary performance that seemd to channel all the forces in the universe simultaneously. It was at once ecstatic, sinister, joyful, dark, and simply bursting with a sense of possibility and freedom. It had a profound trasformational effect on me personally, and was perhaps the catalyst that enabled me to break free from the strictures of my straight-laced Mormon upbringing and to pursue *MY* notions of a self-actualized life....\n\nI digress. Yes, the \"Hard to Handle\" may be the best ever, but the whole second set was just unfuckingbelieveable. I've lost the reel-to-reel I played to death through the '70s, so this download is a godsend.

All the shows from this run at the Hollywood Palladium are worth having, however, if you can only get one, then this is it.

I have few regrets about the Dead, but one is not seeing Pig in his prime, and this show has it.  Then, there's jam in the middle.  The minor key chord progression makes this swing all the harder.

That being said I subsist mainly on abridged memories and good bootlegs. Most of the lifer dead heads who were actuallly there in the early years confirm that the early 70's were the best years. This show is testimony to that statement. \n\nAll I really can say is that it is rare  on any bootleg that I will WANT to listen to the enitre show start to finish. Usually the triggger happy finger will flip to the BEST part or song like flipping to the money shot in a porno. I have to say through and through this show is amazing to the last note. The highlight though is the Uncle tease in the midst of a completely abstruse Other one jam.  It is apparent that Bobby and Jerry know exactly when the crescendo will hit and turn from the elusive Other one to the upbeat cowboy poem of Me and My Uncle. \n\nTo hear this go to Me and My Uncle and fast backward for about three seconds with those trigger happy fingers.",

Check your CD burners instructions to make sure that it is not a problem with your setup.   Make sure that you remove the two-second gap between tracks when using Nero or whatever software you choose.   Of course, be sure to use a 700MB, \"80 minute\" CD-R.\n\nYou will need to refer to the text file (a separate small download you can find on this page) to identify which tracks are SET ONE and which are SET TWO.\n\nMore than likely, this will work for you, and if not, you are only out a few pennies that CD-Rs cost these days.

May '77 Dead was what hooked  me, but this show is quickly becoming one of my favorite shows.  Certainly comes close to 4/29/71 as the best of the year.  Jerry absolutely dominates this show.  His leads drive the band on every song.  He even busts out some riffs on the slower numbers like Brokedown and Loser.  Obviously, the oft-mentioned Hard to Handle dominates the show, but don't let it over-shadow the rest.  The band tears out with a hoppin' Bertha.  Other 1st set highlights are Mr. Charlie and a funky bluegrass Cumberland.  The second set jam is capped off by a ripping Morning Dew.  And, of course, no show would be complete without a show-stopping Lovelight.  This one's got it all.  Amazing quality on this audio tape.  Check it.",

The sound of music blends with the sound of the crowd in a good way, and there isnt any moments of really dominant shouts or voices, (I hate when some guy starts screaming out something like \"hey play Casey Jones man\"), not that there's anything wrong with the song, I just don't want to hear some guys  plaintive crys for it throughout the entire set. This show has none of that... Its hard to believe this show was caught with an audience microphone. Whoever did it totally captured the show and did a really great job. And congrats for that.  The classic Bertha is a great version with a fine tempo, Mr. Charlie is another one of my favorites from the first set, I just love that song, and its done real well here. Cumberland Blues, where a lot o poor man make a 5 dollar bill is fantastic as always and a few bong gurgles later,  Bob sings a fantastic version of me and Bobby McGee. This is not a sterile soundboard, but its absolutely fantastic. I cant see how any Dead fan would be disappointed in this show. This is a must have. Pigpens magnificent version of hard to handle is done just the way its supposed to be, long before those Black Crowe punks prostituted it, and ruined it. Once and a while you will hear someone choking on some of that powerful pot that was everywhere in those days, but this is the best of the AUDs. You would be hard pressed to find a better audience recording of any show. This is the best AUD, in my opinion. for that, and the great set list, I give it 5 stars.",

Good shows were so hard to come by, and the higher quality full shows were all the rarer.  Even then, I knew this was priceless and without exception the best Hard To Handle I'd ever heard.  My view of this version never changed over the years and it was no surprise that Phil included it on Phil Zone.  Anyway, this show summarizes a point in time that many will never understand unless they've paid their dues in the archives of the 60's and 70's - when Pigpen's influence had them at their hard core best.  The 1st set is somewhat short, but you'll be hard pressed to find better versions of everything played, with the exception of the fuckhead I've wanted to strangle for 30 years 'woo-wooing' while he trashes Casey Jones.  The 2nd Set Other One melds into a searing MAMU and back into Other One in a fashion lost through the bands softening over the years with a far more polished sound.  The Deal rocks, the Sugar Magnolia rips and they clean house with the Morning Dew and Lovelight.  Overall, it's my favorite show and typifies the raw energy displayed in many of the small venues that have given us some of the best music we've come to love.  The Hard To Handle jam is Electric Jerry as good as it gets, and Pigpen's timing is right there...I too am surprised this is still available.  It's a must have for any true Deadhead and the ultimate psychedelic doorway to anyone waiting for a bus to get on.",

Five stars ain't enough, especially when you factor in the year and the performance.  \n\nJerry's solo on Mr. Charlie is an absolute shredder!! This has become one of my favorite discs to listen to.

I am glad that GDM changed their minds and let the Archive keep all the AUD's up and running, as well as allowing them to stream the SBD's (many of which can be found elsewhere for quick download, wink wink).\n\nA comment on a review that mentioned the speed on this tape being \"too fast\".  Well, I am sure if you picked up the \"Houseboat Tapes\" Dick's Picks, you realize how wrong you were.  In fact, this AUD source is sooo good, I honestly cannot determine where the AUD stops and SBD starts (see liner notes in your DP CD).  \n\nThe more I hear this show, the more I feel that this may be the BEST recording of a show ever.  I know people throw that phrase around, but I have 1000's of hours on tape & CD, have been to my share of shows since 86 and have listened to pretty much everything out there, as I am a music junky.  I am not making this statement lightly.  The quality, range of pitch (from bass to cymbals), clarity, etc... + the performance = some of the finest art made by mankind.\n\nI am giving this baby out for Christmas this year.\n----------------------------\nOne more note added March 2006: regarding Hard to Handle, listen carefully folks.

Once in the doors, we worked our way to maybe thirty feet from the stage, right center.  Right in front of Jerry on pedal steel with NRPS.  When the Dead came on, Pig was on our side, and from the first notes of Bertha you knew it was going to be one hell of a Lunar Eclipse.  Every song is played with such energy and conviction, every note was just about perfect. I'm not sure if it was the Uncle Sam blotter but we were seeing everyone's aura that night. I remember my face hurting from grinning so much. I finally got my hands on a CD of this show about a year ago from a friend who was born on this day, what a gift. Hard to Handle is best played at top volume with the furniture moved out of the way. My only St. Stephen, but one of the best.  Pigpen was in his best form, and  Lovelight shines.  This is of course, a legendary recording, as Deb Trist put it \"It's like a you-were-there experience\" (or something like that).  Even with Casey's whistle tooter, the audience gives you the feeling of being back on the floor, or leaping in the air, once again.  Thank you Rob Bertrando. Thank you Archive.org.

When I realized someone had actually taped this show, you can imagine my excitement.  I was actually a little afraid to listen to it (the dreaded flashback from the Orange Sunshine somebody -- probably with the GD-- passed around.  It was so potent I still remember walking to the car and cops with billy clubs beating kids who were tripping out.  I ended up at County General -- from the chemicals, not the cops).  \n\nI didn't even remember the NRPS playing that night, but it explains my fondness for them when nobody else i know has ever heard of them (and bless satellite radio for playing their best cuts).  \n\nAs for the taping, it is truly a unique experience, probably due to the mikes being in the middle of a very enthusiastic audience and able to capture much of the dynamic feel (often catching a live clap track in surround sound).\n\nI have many of the GD Dick's Picks and still haven't listened to anything like Jerry's extended solo at the end of Truckin'.  It's too bad it cuts off short -- I'm not sure what happened -- but I think I have a program that will tidy it up a little.  \n\nAnyway, I haven't even listened to the whole thing yet but had to log in throw in my 2 cents.

I read a squib about the Archive in Playboy, no less.  I decided to check it out and noticed that there were quite a few Dead shows to say the least.  Being a fan of blues and rock music my entire life, I figured this was a great way to discover a band that many people consider to be the greatest American band ever.  \nI don't remember how it was, but this was the first show I came across after performing a simple search for \"Casey Jones\" or something to that effect (Casey being the only Dead song I really knew at the time).\nI scrolled down and read a review about this show that said something to the effect of \"you can hear the crowed really take off into the stratosphere during Jerry's solo in 'Hard to Handle.'\"  I believe those words to remain true to this day.  Thanks to this show I have discovered a band that will always have a place in my playlist, my conscience, and my heart.  And after explore countless of hours of Dead shows since listening to this one, I can still say that this show is once of my favorites.  The energy is great, and it will always have a special place in my heart.  Thanks to the guy that taped this sucker in 71,and to the archive, for allowing us to enjoy it all these years later.",

Unfortunately, we only had about $5 between the three of us. Tickets were $5.50 at the door. Then a really loaded guy stumbled upon us and Larry reminded him of his deceased brother. He GAVE us the rest of the money to get in. What a story to tell to get into your first show and were given the money to do it. Larry was RIGHT. The Dead were great! Pigpen was in good form that night. This recording is excellent for a fan recording. Someone asked what guitar Garcia played that night. It was either a Stratocaster or Les Paul. I think these were his primary ones until getting Wolf from Alembic in 1973.",

The Palladium was so crowded and hot and you couldn't move, but the music was so great it didn't matter. The New Riders opened up, and I got to see Garcia play pedal steel with them. What a night! Funny thing, I was standing right behind this guy that was holding a full size reel to reel tape recorder. I don't know how the hell he managed to do it, but he did.  He had two guys holding microphones, one way to the left and one way to the right. The mic cables must have been at least 25 or 30 feet long, and these guys were holding the microphones up over the crowd.  Pigpen was in great form that night and Garcia was playing his ass off, the band was on fire. I'm so glad those guys made that tape! It would have only been a distant memory.",

In 1971, I was a surfer hippie from Orange County\u2014roll one and go surfing\u2014everybody understands that.  The only bummer about \u201871 is all these surfers from OC became Jesus Freaks.  Sorry about that, but it was not my fault.  It would be interesting to see where all those losers are now.  So, I was 17 & I bought two tickets to take a very pretty SurfGirl to see the Dead at the Hollywood Palladium\u2019s August 6th show.  We met a friend with his date there & scored a table to sit & watch the show.  That was even more kool because the tables were hard to get & they had a great view of the show, the stage & the crowd.   This SurfGirl had a crush on me & I thought a first date seeing the Grateful Dead was a Special Thing. WELL HECK, IT WAS A SPECIAL THING.  Jerry Garcia was 30 feet away & played pedal-steel for a full set with NRPS, then he played a full night with our boys. It only took 15 minutes into NRPS when my SurfGirl excused herself to the bathroom\u2014well that\u2019s sort of normal. So after 20 minutes I thought it was still normal, then it turned into 1 hour, then 1 \u00bd hours, then 3 hours, and of course, the whole show.  Since it was a Dead show & a great night, I thought she found her true psychedelic SurfDude, and she was out dancing with him. I thought I was bum-out-of-luck.  BUT, when the lights came back on in the Hollywood Palladium, my SurfBabe came back to our table. Her hair was wet & she was drained from crying for 3+ hours in the toilet stall. I asked her what was wrong & she screamed \u201cwhat is your problem?\u2026you didn\u2019t even notice I was gone....I told you I was going to the bathroom\u2026.and you left me in there for 4 hours\u2026.why didn\u2019t you save me from these hairy miscreants?\u2026\u201d      What?  Really?  What??  I am so sorry beautiful young surfgirl, if only I had known, I would have risked all to save you from the hippies\u2014even getting thrown out of the Hollywood Palladium for hanging out in the wrong bathroom.  That would have been a small price to pay!  Except Jeez, it never really occurred to me that girls hide in bathroom stalls & cry when they get scared.  I tried to be understanding, but I was not sensitive enough.  Things did not get better after that.  To say the least, it was a very long drive back to Huntington Beach.\n\nTo all the gals who read this, I honestly thought we could have a nice date & evening. I was young too.  I was not trying to take a teenage girl to a free-love hippie fest. \n\nTrue Story. No BS.  \n",
