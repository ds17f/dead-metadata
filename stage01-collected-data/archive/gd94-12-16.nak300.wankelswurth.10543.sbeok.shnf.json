      "review_text": "Branford steps into furthering the \"inspiration (which) moves me brightly\"! I need to apologize because for some strange reason this is appearing twice! Not my intention; this has happened to not only me before, but I first noticed it on someone else's review then, on one of mine so I reported it! First, let me say that I realize I wrote this in a rather convoluted way, but if you bare with me hopeful it will make sense.\n     I'm just speculating, when I imagine that it could be possible and thus not surprise me, if someone were to criticize this performance in such a way, (although I've never heard any mention as such), as to be partial to Marsalis' New York appearances. I was lucky enough to have seen all of his guest appearances on the West Coast. Now I've heard and seen the recordings in the cases of the Madison Square Garden and Nassau shows, (with Branford) quite a few times. So, I believe I can say objectively even though I wasn't there for those, (I almost never review shows that I didn't actually attend, Hint, Hint)!\n     [If this next section doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I hesitated to make the following analogy, since it requires so much subjective explanation. Believe it or not, I omitted some facts that lead me to this analogy in the first place.] Namely, even though they didn't play \"Dark Star\" here in L.A. at this show the fol owing is still relevant that is; I remember perceiving at that New Year's show, despite Branford's presence, the \"Dark Star\" as the weakest of the five \"Dark Star\"'s I've seen! Mostly because it was short and because of Jerry's illness of some sort at the time! However, I did see on a website similar to this, (which shall be remain nameless, partially because for reasons unknown, that critique, or set of critiques, has long since been removed), contradicting my assessment of the level of that \"Dark Star\". Coming from someone possessing what I \"normally\", or should I say otherwise, would consider an \"expert opinion\", (since apparently, this fellow had studied in detail, virtually every known recording of \"Dark Star\" and \"The Other One\", a scholarship to which, by the way, I don't claim membership)!\n     In so reasoning, probably I suspect in a similar way, (but never clarified as to how or why), as I do below, in referencing the same felling about \"Eternity\" here at this L.A. show ie. they really went \"outside\". I figure that must be kind of like, (since I just re-listened to the following the other day), the \"Dark Star\" they played in Miami in '89, (which I didn't attend), where although they really went \"outside\" (meaning, see below), Jerry sang very poorly. I say all this, because even though I have heard this and do remember the show as probably the best with Branford, (at least that I saw with him), I haven't heard it that many times; certainly not as many times as I have the New York shows, nor as recently even though I was there for this one!\n     Therefore, since I would like to remain credible given that, not only have I seen some bad or mediocre reviews recently, of what I remember to have enjoyed, (although my enjoyment was primarily bolstered by some rarity or new tune etc. in a given case), hence, just because this had Branford included doesn't guarantee it's high rating. ie. I'm trying to remain objective here, since far too many times have I found people raving how good a  show was when I was quite certain of its' mediocrity.\n     Yet, in light of the fact that in general, (which I believe has more to do with my increasing lack of the wherewithal to obtain a recording shortly after a given show), as well as the frequency of how generic many of the shows were becoming, before the introduction of all, and I mean \"all\", of the then latest, and now obviously, the \"last\" set of new tunes). Thus this results in my certainty regarding a given show's level of intensity; being much greater in reference to early or midway, rather than of the later ones during the years I saw them perform, ('76 -'94). Thus tempering my confidence to the extent, that I should feel compelled to write all this.\n     Having at least once, wrote an over confident praise of a show, I hadn't heard in a very long time, due to the theft of my old recordings; and then later to realize I had exaggerated in reference to the performance, and in addition to besides that, the sound itself being disappointingly far worse than expected, ie. than what I had originally thought.\n     What I mean is, indeed Branford was inspiring for most all of us! But just because I was there and so was he, doesn't remove my hesitation to simply claim it's greatness without exception, thus potentially overstating the truth, as I did at least once before.\n     Nevertheless, I'm more confident in my memory of \"Eternity\" greatness as being particularly \"outside\", if you will! (An old jazz bebop expression, a term that gee, I haven't really used in a very long time ie. I don't say that lightly. Again, I guess Branford being a sax player, brings me back to saying that.)\n     So, rather than continue carrying on ad nauseam, with my efforts in conveying qualifications for my caution in applying adulation to reviewing this one, almost to the point of irrationally; perhaps it's more appropriate for me to reserve that for, (by not reviewing at all), the several shows I attended in this late era. For which, given that I had not soon there after, obtained a recording, and unlike this one, having a no direct clear cut legitimate reference, (ie. Branford as guest), with which to, despite the frequency and total, of my having listened to this one, being few and far between, mitigate that infrequent number of hearings, by Branford Marsalis' presence! But as I said to start with by implication in my title, probably and hopefully not, the only one; that thing with which mutually, I'm certain you'll are familiar with namely, that \"inspiration moves me (us) brightly\", (even though this doesn't have a Terrapin in it) and simply shut up, and give into saying : This is hot, get the download!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

      "review_text": "Here is an actual review for this show!!! Night two of four at the Sports Arena. Rumour in the lot is that both Dylan and Branford are here tonight. Dylan, I'm not so sure of, but Branford is a safe bet because at the time he was the leader of the 'Tonight Show' Band up in Burbank, and the show was in reruns that week. Sure enough, Branford was out from the first song. He was fairly reserved throughout the first set - even sitting on the drum riser during 'Childhood's End' and leaving the stage during 'Tom Thumb', (my friend thought he was going backstage to drag Dylan onstage!) First set ended nicely with the 'Eternity>Dont Ease'.\nAnd then the second set - the main event, and looking back on it - the last time I ever saw God with the Grateful Dead.\nA sweet 'Eyes' with Branford and Jerry feeding off each other - pure bliss. A throwaway 'Samba' and a somewhat choppy intro into 'Estimated' but then...KABOOM!!! The Estimated jam went somewhere North of the Crab Nebula which I can only describe as intense as any Dark Star I've ever heard - simply incredible! The label on the DAT of this show had an asterisk next to the Estimated, which read : \"WARNING!! - Do not operate heavy machinery or take any cold medicines while listening to this!\" Just when you thought they could go nowhere else except into a Dark Star after that unbelievable jam, they emerge with 'He's Gone' - well played, somewhat reduced in energy, but at least gave me a chance to locate my brain.\nThe rest of the show is fairly standard. Jerry's voice shot throughout. A solid 'Other One' and a fall apart 'Lucy'.\nBut I'll always remember that 'Estimated' which if for nothing else is the reason you should have this show (the 'Eternity' is a must have as well). Post 91' shows were often a frustrating experience, and 94 was a year in full decline, culminating in the death march of 95. But for one brief shining moment, it was all there - a little shaky, but there it was! I saw 93 shows in my tenure with The Dead, including the last show at Soldier Field. This show represents the last time I ever saw the Dead really 'bring it'.\n\nA 5 rating only to bring the 'Estimated' to your attention - trust me folks, this is IT!!!",

      "review_text": "I'll Never Forget This One This was a most memorable show for me. I believe my first show was in '76 somewhere in The Great State of Illinois. Reliable sources tell me I was there. Those were the DAYS. But I've got to tell you, thirty years of seeing these guys has been something special indeed. Now, this show was in it's own class. Or space in time. \"Laid Back LA\" was on it's feet from the beginning.Don't tell me this town doesn't ROCK! Here I am, all grown up, responsibile, ....you know an \"adult\". I go to the show with my friends Kenny and Pie. Yes, Punkin' Pie. The Pie. The One and Only. We had great \"seats\"(Ha!.....there were NO seats!) row 7 or something, on the floor. All of our other friends were there. It was just one big Happy Jack Salad. We're all over the place, as usual.The energy is ON from the get go. Unbelievable. Sweet Jerry and the band played their hearts out. Brandon was an awesome addition to the mix. I do believe it was Brandon, and the \"seedy back alley ambience\"(thank you Hunter, R.I.P.), which is just \"SO LA\",that took this show to the a whole other sphere. \nI've been clean and sober for years, but I couldn't have felt any \"higher\". The music, the set and the sound was incredible. Download this show! You will hear THE BEST EVER \"So Many Roads\". Yes, for the encore, Pie and I were the two,uh,chicks dancing on stage. Thank you Steve Parish! Trust me on this one.This show was a real jem. I wish, as I'm sure we all do, there was just one more show. Just one more lick.\"The heart has it's seasons, it's beaches, it's songs of its's own\" Or something like that...... \nNFA",

I'm trying to find all the Branford shows, and so far I've got 3/29/90, 9/10/91 and 12/10/93.\n\nAs for this show, I'll wait for the SBD. Keep up the awesome work archive and etree - you are truly bestowing a blessing upon Dead Nation.",

The great surprise is that you think they are going into drums after this and the jam nicely into he's gone. The post space portion is a let down but man it's amazing to see what can happen when you bring a guest into the mix for one night.\n\nCringle: I think you are missing 12-31-90 Oakland. This was Branford's second show with them.",

I always wished he played alot more than that with them as I love the Dead's music with a sax in the mix. I really don't get the point of the mindless dribble below my review...it has no redeeming qualities what so ever and is far from being worth reading, although it does remind me of that infamous commercial of the egg frying on the pan...you know the one.\nAnyways this is a great show. The 'Eyes' are always magical with Branford and the 'Samba' is great here and sounds the way Vince played it with his Missing Man Formation.",

Criticism isn't always necessary to show that you are on top of your world. But since you are... Remember the good ole days before the internet when you talked with people and exchanged addresses, sometimes a couple of green backs, mabey even that plus a tape or two. Oh I'm sorry to point it out but are some these supposed \"Heads\" expecting a little somethin', somethin' extra. I'm sorry to go on like this.. Like many others I wish I would have been at this show. It don't mean that what I have say is irrellevant though. By the way Thank you to those of you actually post concerts. Including this one.

      "review_text": "Indeed Indeed this Estimated is out of hand.  By this point, in my opinion, the performance by the band overall was falling off...the short set lists, the Corrinas, Sambas, Way to Go in middle of second set (where things use to get fun)...the shows were just subpar.  I had accepted that attending a show that was 'mind left body' from start to finish was done...I had accepted that finding 15-20 minutes of Jerry hunching over nuggets was all we could expect...and that wasn't going to be every night.  There were some of these nuggets in 94 and 95....the Estimated from this evening is one of those nuggets.  Don't get me wrong, going to see the Band was still a helluva lot better than anything out there -- but no more full sets of fun -- Hampton 3-27-87 Set II...so what, scar, fire...through SSDD...as an example...just nuggets here an there....The later years...Hornsby got Jerry fired up as did Branford (and David Murray that year at MSG)...no exception in San Diego.  Check it out for yourself.  And do not every forget...the Fatman ROCKED....",

I'm sorry, Phil. I still love you. \n\nSecond - Samba in the Rain is a good tune, and this version KICKS ASS with Branford adding another lead, as Jerry usually was lost on every version. \n\nThat is all. Carry on.
