Here they share the bill with Miles Davis who was also playing legendary improvisation with the recent albums of Silent In A Way, Bitches Brew and Live Evil.  I\"ve read where Lesh in particular would watch stage side and be blown away by Miles nightly however the Dead responded with their own magic as heard in this Dancin'.  Foreshadowing the monster from Harpur in May, this version shakes and twists offering circular lead runs with trademark two headed beast rythyms.",

The GRATEFUL DEAD arranged this song in a fast 6/8. Huge Blues influence from Pigpen, the SOUL of the Band.  God Bless Pigpen. We all still miss him.

And while I will not argue with anyone who says the 5/2/70 Dancin' is better (definitely makes a case for best ever) I still say this one is on par - Garica creates almost a \"beat\" with his guitar (well really he's playing off the rhythm section but that's just what it sounds like to me) in places that I have never heard before - really interesting stuff. Portions really have that Dark Star feel to them too, know what i mean?

Still, there are some stellar moments, especially on Viola Lee Blues.  \"Snaky\" is a good word to describe Jerry's playing on this one.  The Dancin' is good, but come on, people!  It's NOT EVEN CLOSE to 5/2/70, even if it does appear on Fallout from the Phil Zone.  Since that show isn't on the Archive, I can't review it in the proper place, but let's just say Jerry played the 5/2/70 Dancin' with a creativity unapproached on any other version of this song, including a psychedelic section reminiscent of 69 Dark Stars.  (If you don't have DP8, what are you waiting for?  Get it!!)\n\nSchoolgirl, Uncle John's, and Man's World are pretty solid, but the rest of the show hasn't got much interesting, and the China>Rider transition is sloppy as heck - they're playing in two different keys.

      "review_text": "BEST Dancin' EVER I will have to cast my vote for this Dancin' as being far better than 1970-05-02. Garcia's solo is way more unique during this show. Starting at 4:43, he launches into a purely \"Dead\" moment of group synergy. The whole band comes along for the ride with Phil pounding out the jam in signature style. I am most taken aback by the prominence of Pigpen's organ. On most of the 1970 tapes his organ volume is turned way back. This song and this show might be considered one of the last great Pigpen organ shows. He is recreating the fast-paced organ playing you hear on shows from '66-'68. Viola Lee Blues is magical as a result. Now, as for the Dancin'-   \n\n5:40 Jerry starts the magic carpet ride\n\n6:22 - 6:40 peaks into a psychedelic epiphany\n\n7:08 - 7:25 a little mind blowing takes place\n\n8:27 - Pigpen contributes some fine organ\n\n8:53 - noodle riff leads you off to the stars\n\nI know some people prefer the 5/2 Dancin' because it almost sounds like a Dark Star. Well I think that is great, but it does just that: sounds like a Dark Star jam. I think this Dancin jam is much more true to the original melody while blasting off into some interesting territory. \n\nThis may not be the best show all the way through, but the Dancin' is hard to beat.",

      "review_text": "Last few miles <br />The last show of the 4-night run co-headlining with Miles Davis. Interestingly, they played again a few days later at nearby Winterland (there were 31 Bay Area shows in '70). This would have been the perfect time to see the Davis Quintet. The Dead played one lengthy set, about 2hrs with the missing Bid You encore. A typical show from the era (gphishmon already said it  best). The May shows are a step above the April shows. The AUD portion is brilliant for '70 - you can hear Phil.\n\n<i>Schoolgirl</i> has a nice section ~12:00. The next couple are rote run-throughs. <i>China</i> gets a little sideways, but a highly spirited <i>Rider</i> more than makes up for it. It does sound like they go into High Time while finishing, but it equally sounds like a tape-over artifact. Either way, the beginning of <i>Good Lovin'</i> is cut - a middling version, way uptempo (even at the correct pitch). The jam coming out of <i>Drums</i> is a high point - especially Phil. <i>Candyman</i> is still the new tune; probably the 5th one. See the next show for a better example of this arrangement (or 5/2). But see 5/14 for the same in <i>Deep Elem</i>. The next couple pick up the zap, though <i>Dire Wolf</i> is a bit out of tune (which Bobby announces - into his mic). My opinion of this <i>Dancin' in the Streets</i> has improved. If not the absolute best from the period, it's fully interesting. Some hear a Tighten Up jam early on, but Dancin' is already two similar chords (so not a real Tighten, as in a Dark Star). There is, however, a pre-Mind Left Body jam that Phil plays @9:00. The way they come out of the jam is nice,  but between 5:00>6:30 Jer really lights the fuck up and this section makes it a must-hear. In <i>Black Peter</i> Pigpen's organ sounds like a '70s soap opera going to commercial, but it's a fairly dramatic version, if awfully spare. The rest is a wash, with some sour harmonies in <i>Uncle John's</i>, a bland <i>Man's World</i>, and a <i>Viola Lee</i> that starts downtempo. This pace gives Jer a lot of room, but he doesn't really go anywhere, resting on trad figures.\n\nOverall = 2\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nI Know You Rider - spirited\nDancing in the Street - Phil's favorite and a near-classic\n\nSOURCES: The SBD runs fast and needs <u>-3% pitch correction</u> for Schoolgirl; <u>-1% for</u> Cumberland & Dire Wolf; and <u>-1.5% for</u> Dancin' through Viola.  Dancing is also on <b>Fallout</b>.",
