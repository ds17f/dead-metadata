The Unbroken out of Space is pretty decent, but it's the band playing and Jerry barely even audible, kind of like most of the show.  From listening to the Black Muddy encore, Jerry sounds pretty strong and it actually sounds like Vince that screws it up in the transition.  Phil shines on this, always thought Childhood's End was a pretty nice one, too.  Sad to listen to this, but this was the culmination of Jerry's long, slow decline.

Good recording,  especially since you can hear Weir's flourishes better than in many other recordings. Even with all the alleged \"Garcia problems\",  he's still whipping out some very nice riffs,  many times. \n\n\"Touch of Grey\",  \"Lazy River\",  \"Little Red Rooster\", \"Black Muddy River\",  \"Shakedown\", and \"Masterpiece\" are all musically tight.  \"Sugar Magnolia\" and a few others are kind of messy,  and Garcia certainly sang better,  but the guitars sound better than average in my opinion.  In fact,  the poor vocal work on \"Shakedown\" is kind of a benefit,  in a way,  since the music is so good.\n\nGive it a 2nd chance,  if you've heard it before.

It sucks to read some of the negative comments written on this board about this last show of theirs because--you should say to yourself--\"I was lucky to see this show or at least have the opportunity to have bought tickets for this show and many other shows during the 80's, 70's and even 60's.\"  Many of us downloading these files and buying the DVD's and even having the opportunity to see the current band tour would give a right arm and eyeball to see the band even when they were not on top form.  I would give a testicle to have the opportunity to go back in time and catch the band at any point in their history--just to have the opportunity to experience the magic that was the GD.  This recording represents more then a good/bad show, or a good/bad recording: this show represents the end of a legacy, the end of an era--and band that can never be replaced.  Just take a look now at the current music scene and you can understand what I mean.  There is for sure an empty space where the grateful dead (and other great bands of the 60's & 70's) once occupied, and music will never be the same again.  So please, don't be ungrateful and accept this recording--with all of its imperfection et cetera--for what it is, a special show that marked the end of a way of life for many of you, and most deffinitely the end of an era...",

Being a part of this world meant taking the good with the bad though- it was about not only the music, but the utterly unique relationship between the band and the audience. I don't want to listen to this show but it is the moment of closure. Of course it's a line flub on \"last muddy river....\" and heroin saps life even from the most spirited. I only wish that this show had a \"Foolish Heart\" in it to provide the final irony. We gave our love to a foolish heart, and it finally failed. Nonetheless, hearing  that heart sing is the coda.",

      "review_text": "My Second Show I just found this website, and for a longtime fan, it doesn't get much better than this.  I had scored tickets from the dead mail-in service, and I took my brother, my best friend, and one of my old guitar players.  We were right next to the soundboard, and the music was out of this world.  I've heard many shows on tape, and now thru DL, but obviously the real deal smokes any recording.  Big time.\n      After a long day on Shakedown with drum circles fifty drummers around, stoned dogs, grey dreads, grilled cheese, miracles, and many wonderful smells, we decided to have a fungal time right before the show.\n       When the lights went down and everyone lit their lighters, it looked like space on earth.  I had seen Jerry and the boys the year before, but that was before I really knew their music.  After my first show I started buying and taping tons of shows.  This time I was ready.  Unfortunatly my guitar player hadn't really studied the dead like I did, so he didn't get the same effect.  But he was pretty impressed we were on the fifty yard line where the Bears played.  The Chicago Bears, I mean.  The couple in front of us had both taken 7 hits of LSD a piece, and they were really jamming.  That girl got so much more beautiful as the night wore on.  \n     As to the show.  Opening with TOG was an excellent way to begin, I thought.  Sort of ironic too... \"I will survive.\"  Jerry, unfortunatly, looked bad.  It was obvious how the drugs had taken their toll.  He warmed up as the night went on, for sure, but those close ups on the mega-tron of his face hurt my heart.  Bobby was right on, though.  I had never heard Masterpiece before that, but I immediatly caught the meaning and really dug it.  Phil as always, was smokin hot.  I had heard of Lesh bombs, and now, I'll never forget them.  \n     I remembered looking around during Shakedown Street and thinking that everyone in the stadium was a kind of musician, and that made me think of Playing in the Band's meaning, and the line, \"the music played the band\" from The Music Never Stopped.  The music wasn't just coming from the speakers, but from everywhere.  And it seemed like people there had a say in the outcome.  It really amazed me and made me look at music in a very different way forever.  It was like, there were the boys on stage, and the band was everywhere around me.  Made me wonder if anyone else had ever thought about that.\n    Anyway, rumors about Unbroken Chain were everywhere, and they panned out to be true.  That was amazing from a historical standpoint.  The last bit about the show that really got me was drums.  At one point the music swelled and I thought my head was going to explode.  Thumbs up to Mickey and Billy for that moment.  Way up.\n     Of course Box of Rain and the double encore were an added bonus, and I was even really impressed with the fireworks.  My guitar player told me that at some point I turned into a fish during the night, which seemed about right.  \n     I am very grateful for this site, again.  Not only can I listen to all the other shows, but this one, which means a lot to me.  That's why I am giving it 5 stars.  It's a little hard to listen to the lyrical mistakes, but the places that they go otherwise, well, that's deserving.  Plus, Jerry died a month later.  It's commendable to do this kind of performance in the shape he was in.  \n     The show effected me so much that I decided I was definitely going on the road with them the next summer...  Oh well.  All I can say is, \"We will survive.\"",

I think I see this show as probably the guys did, last show of a fateful tour, only to be re-energized for the next go round.  The naysayers point out Jerry being atr the end of the road, but I find just as many reviewers pointing out great shows they had seen a week or a month or whatever ago.\n\nEach tour had its ups and downs, and the frequency depended on what you were looking for.  But I challenge everyone to show me that you knew this was it at the time.  Jerry had risen from the dead so many times, we all expected it again.  The moments in this show just seemed a glimpse of what will be again.\n\nFor all those who say they saw the unravelling of the band, or any similar remark, and I can show you just as many reviews that point to the idea that the boys weren't done yet.  That being said, this show is a necessity for closure, and in hindsight, So Many Roads is Jerry's swan song, but not because he is saying goodbye (at that time), but more of the idea that Jerry is saying \"Look, I can still do it!\"  The passion in this song is unrivaled by any performance.\n\nTo all of us, had this not been the show to end all shows, we would all be looking forward to the next run or tour, and we would have been looking back at moments of this show for what they were....a jumping off point to would was to be",

Anyone who had been on the bus knows that at this point the shine had clearly worn off Jerry.  The band's playing during the \"Tour From Hell\" was nearly heroic in that they were carrying him.  We, in a sense, were watching him die.\n\nWhy the five stars?  Three words:  \"Black Muddy River\".  Jerry's rendering of this tune makes me forget the sloppy guitar work and spotty vocals.\n\nThis song has been on \"repeat\" during my morning commute, and I hear something different each time it is played...BMR never fails to make my hair stand on end.  The way his voice catches as he delivers the line, \"When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain...\" serves as a reminder as to just how shallow most of music has become today...makes his death all the more damaging...the tune that more urgent-prophetic.\n\nLike any vocalist worth his or her salt, Jerry always found a way to \"become\" the song.  Proving that you can wipe your bum with a set of good \"pipes\".  Plastic never makes it.  Delivery is everything.  Do you think Rubin Stoddard and others in the vast pot of treacle known as \"Pop Music\" could take us down along the BMR as Jer does?  I don't think do.  His voice is pure unadulterated emotion.  I can see the \"swirls\", hear the \"ripples\", feel the singer's isolation.  If the Crucifixion had a soundtrack, this would be the final cut; the stage serving as Golgotha, the sweet \"Judas\" kiss of opium (his betrayer)flowing through his veins...leading him to the BMR.  One more editorial comment, and I'm done.\n\nCan you even begin to imagine the physical/spiritual burden that he carried the last five years of his life feeding the public's incessant needs and those that depended on him for the basics?  Deification on any level is a heavy trip.  Take a look at the paparazzi shots of him at Serenity Knowles days before he died...head cradled in his hands a very exhausted, very mortal man who was already walking the banks of the Black Muddy River.  Never has one tune been so historically appropriate as a \"swan song\".",

Jerry's voice is cracking and he hits a lot of \"clams\".

But I like to hear it. It's got its historical context, and makes me smile, as the bands I listen to today do. I wish some of you guys on here would stop all this bickering. Yeah I see where you're coming from when you say taht druggies are ruining the scene and have been for years, but at the same time they're not. They've always been there, and always will be. In many respects the music we listen to goes hand and hand with the drugs that we see at the concerts. But i dont' think you should dis it, it's something a lot of have participated in. I think instead you should just let people be whoever the fuck they want to be.\n\nThat's what the dead did for me when I started listening to them at 13. It kept me from becoming another obnoxious iggnorant fool at my rural school in Virginia. It exposed me to a whole new world out there, full of amazing music, amazing people, and yes the drugs that much of the time go hand and hand with the community we're all involved with. \n\nSo i guess what I'm trying to say is let it go.

I finally listened to this show from Start to Finish; and I must tell you, the sound quality is 4.5 stars, everyone in the band is playing three stars, but after 'Drums/Space' the show is a total disaster! Jerry must have checked out after 'So Many Roads', because up to that point, the show is OK to decent, but AFTER drums/space the show has to be one of the worst concerts ever!  Jerry sounds like a senile old man playing with a guitar. I am really sorry to say it. Listen to it. Its painful to hear, but during 'Unbroken Chain' the end was apparent. Then Mr. Weir tries to salvage some dignity by cutting in with a 'Sugar Mag', but it really was too late. The 'Black Muddy River' is really painful to listen to, too. 'Box of Rain' is the redeeming quality; -- Redemption -- pretty much sums up the band's repetoire. I love the GD, but its such a damn shame!!  \n\nP.S. To the \"Tito & Touch head rules crowd\", I think your completely right about bastardized version of the GD known as 'The Dead' destroying Jerry's legacy.  ....But remember 'the Dead' is not the 'Grateful Dead'.  They are a new different band , with a new evolved sound of old classics.  They may not be liked by all, but their damn good musicians with a great sound. (EXCEPT when they try to tackle jerrys' ballads!) You have to take the good with the bad, I quess...\nIt just reaffirms that every artist is truly unique and when their gone, \"they ain't coming back.\"  So you just got to let it go and move on!\nNo one can ever duplicate an artist's genius, especially jerry's. -- That's what made the GD, so damn SWEET!!!   \n\nSorry for superfluous words. and Thanks for letting me get that out!!  Thanks to those responsible for this site!!\n\n...So it goes.",

Near the end I stopped seeing shows due to the slow decline of the quality of music, and the music was the reason I started seeing them in the 1st place.  Unfortunately, I have heard the tapes of this show and even worse, I have seen the video of this.  Giving this show a low rating is no disrespect to everyones past experiences with the Dead.  It is a reflection of how bad this show was and if you've seen pictures or video of it your heart will break to see Jerry up there looking as bad as he ever did.  I put away all the tapes of this show and put the DVD I have on the bottom of the stack so I may never have to think of Jerry or the Dead in this crappy state of being. 1 star  (who's gonna give it the 100th review?)",

So Many Roads is impassioned, although I think people read too much into Jerry's declining health and that he just knew...Anyhow, this is a passage from Phil's Book: \"At the last show, I watched in despair as Jerry, whey-faced, hunched over with chin on chest, fighting for breath before singing every line, struggled through an incredibly moving performance of So Many Roads...he seemed to respond only on the slowest, saddest songs...for the encore Jerry sang Black Muddy River, and then I launched into Box of Rain at the last minute because I couldn't stand the thought of ending the tour with one of Jerry's most sorrowful songs\"",

Short first set.  Shakedown was poor when compared to all the other wonderful versions out there, Samson was poor, So Many Roads was quite nice (lots of emotion from Jerry on this one), Samba In The Rain never once worked (seems like Jerry couldn't get his head around this one, his playing NEVER clicked once) *wow, four 'S' songs in a row*, Corrina was actually pretty good (the first version that I ever actually enjoyed), Drums and Space were also quite good (seems like the drummers were really in a groove during spring and summer of this year), Unbroken Chain also suffered from poor Jerry playing (just couldn't find the notes), Sugar Mag has a GREAT Bob tone and attack (his guitar was sounding pretty cool on this tour), BMRiver had lots of emotion due to Jerry's voice being what it was (even if one was unaware of all the 'heavy' significance surrounding this song/show, it was sound pretty 'emotional'), and 'far out! double encore!' Box Of Rain (not much to comment on there).

On the stage was a creative giant, who had achieved more than all of us combined, struggling with his mortality. (Like Jerry, Miles had a problem with Mr. Charlie.) There are those that say that Miles, Jerry,  opera's Joan Sutherland, Sinatra should have quit earlier, gone out on a high note. I disagree. They continued to give something precious, ineffible, world-enhancing. They kept on keeping on not for the money -- they had plenty. The did it because music was the blood that flowed through their veins.\n\nTHAT being said, to give this show 5 stars does a disservice to the hundreds of really fine shows the Grateful Dead pulled out of the ether. After you listen to this show, listen to any of the Dick's Picks from any period. You'll hear a fiery passion in Jerry's guitar, or a tender coaxing of humanity from the strings, technically creative and clever, guitar that moves the soul, guitar you can listen to by itself, and guitar that syncs intimately with the rest of the band. It's not here. Cumberland Blues embodies this.  Jerry's most soulful vocal here is BMR, and it's good, but it's not a 5 star performance. Listen to the Morning Dews of the '70's (try 1974-6-18), or Loser almost from any period. The band doesn't mesh here, and Phil is just awful.\n\nI didn't know what to expect on Sunday August 13, 1995, when I headed towards the Memorial in the Golden Gate Park Polo Fields, San Francisco. As the sounds of Jerry came over the sound system, the people gave tributes, laid flowers on a shrine, strangers stoppin  \u00c2 strangers just to shake their hand, and talking, talking, talking. More celebratory than sad. Silence fell on the crowd, though, when the speakers played We Bid You Good Night. We are mortal, even the giants.",

Each year I would find more and more to complain about afterwards and that's not including the whole scene outside before the shows (alot of heads should not have been trying to even walk across busy Lake Shore Drive let alone drive down it...and watching heads trying to get the cabbies to drive them back up to Wisconsin was insane and comical).\n\nFor a large outdoor stadium, old Soldier field was an excellent venue not only visually (with the skyline, the lake and the greek columns surrounding the facade) but it's old bowl shape was about as intimate as a football stadium could get. I never understood why Chicago hadn't reached the \"summer dead show mystique\" of a place like RFK, Deer Creek or even a Rich Stadium. I was always expecting the band to come into the Chicago shows (considering the beautiful surroundings) with the mindset that they could make it a special stop on the tour. \n\nBut like I said, I was always left wanting a few more memories to take away...like I had with other cities I had seen shows in. Why should I see amazing show after amazing show in little Richfield, Ohio but not in downtown Chicago?! \n\nBy the time I got to Summer '95, I had all but stopped the drugs and the hanging out and was really looking for the \"pure experience\". In retrospect, I should have gotten completely baked with the guys sitting next to me, because they sure as hell didn't care that Jerry was basically being propped up with a broomstick, force-fed a teleprompter like some stiff weather man, and looking down at his guitar in befuddlement as it seemingly was playing itself on auto-pilot mode.\n\nIt's hard to review the first set as no memories of it exist for me whatsoever...nothing stuck with me. I remember the second set opening-Shakedown (with scenes of the city on the big screen) had people in my group very excited that we may get a real departure from the standard 2nd sets the boys were playing that particular summer. Then we get a Samson, a So Many Roads, a Samba and a Corrina...where are the jams at? It was like we got another first set and I didn't pay for two jam-less sets! \n\nI was screaming along at the end of \"Roads\", don't get me wrong, but it seemed to me that the band was just not even wanting at that point to start any kind of intense improvising for fear that Jerry would embarrass himself. The band would end up playing the entire concert pretty close to the vest, with the classic Dead suprize factor all but gone. \n\nFunny how when you are sober, Drums and Space (especially '95 space) would just have you checking your watch at times and looking around watching people sleeping, going to get a hot dog or just goofing off in general...the space from this show just wouldn't end and when the band has no coherent idea what it wants space to be, they end up taking up most of the space segment just trying to find something that sticks...nothing did that night so they just ended it with an Unbroken Chain that seemed to catch everyone in the band off-guard, including Phil. I enjoyed hearing that song live for the first time, but novelty doesn't make for any lifelong memories.\n\nAfter the show, I didn't know what to think other than I was surely willing to give them another chance and another and another after that...never got to and I still have that bad taste in my mouth to this day.",

Going to a show that musically may have been sub-par does not mean that the experience of just being there wasn't wonderful.  The Grateful Dead created something that had never been created before, and definately will never be created again - not with phish, not with string cheese, NO ONE!  That special something officially ended with this show.  The dead scene went through stages just like any thing else that is alive.  It was born, it grew and matured, it changed with the times, and eventually it died.  This show is so special that no number of stars could do it justice.  Don't listen to this show with a critical ear, or expecting Jer to remember all the words, but listen to this show and be grateful for all the love and music and good times that were had over the years.  Time just flys. It doesn't seem like it was that long ago when the fat man was up there serenading us.  Damn.",

The bottom line is simple: 30, 40 years? They gave everything to us, the fans. All this free music, most SBD quality, AUDs as well. Wonderful. This show is warm, well played, and historic. Jerry and the crew touched us all, and it is now our turn make sure the music never stop....and so on...\n\nThis show is great. Good tunes, Jerry gave everything he had. We all died a little inside. Download this, and play it loud. It is NOT a bad show, 95 or not. If you get confused....\n\nHighlights - Unbroken is great. Black muddy, wonderful.\nBox of Rain - well, if you need it....if not...",

Certainly we have the band to thank for all the music that went on for 30 years , we also have each other to thank. So THANK YOU !!! Everyone one of you who ever walked by , nodded, smiled , passed me a joint or a beer, hooked me up with a tape , sold me a t-shirt , gave me directions, gave me info on security , danced next to me,yelled in my ear during Crazy Fingers , THANKS! A long strange trip indeed. Let's all consider ourselves lucky that we were all able to be there , in whatever varying degrees, 500 shows or 1. We were all part of the greatest communtunity , the biggest traveling circus and sideshow that ever roamed the countryside. The most prolific and enduring concert attraction in the history of rock and roll.There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert.",

      "review_text": "Childhood's End There are several reasons why this show is worth having. Historically it is the coda to a long strange trip many were fortunate to ride along. But its significance resides in the same reasons many criticize it. Given time to place it in perspective, the sentimental appeal is obvious. Yet the flaws documented are every bit as precious for exhibiting what made this band great. They were uncompromising. They were not concerned with image, or fame or popularity or hits,unless these things interfered with their main purpose. They played their music out of love for playing. And it's all on tape, warts and all: when they soared and when they flopped, Every miscue, every sour note, every flubbed line. It's all recorded for generations to TRY and recreate. But for those fortunate enough to have actually participated, it is an experience that could never be truly transmitted to another, unless they too have been on the bus. With that said this performance has its defining moments as already mentioned. furthermore they are performing new music right to the end. And it's quality stuff too. The Stones can't say that, although they are still breathing(well..er sorta)My point is that GD were a going concern even at the bitter end. And despite a marked decline in Jerry's ability due to failing health and his notorious dependency, he could still pull some magic tricks out of his sleeve. Even in decline he could still shine. I agree this performance is often tragic, even pathetic at times. But it's honest and that's what characterized this band and Jerry. Integrity set them apart from the multitude of rock stars and pop entertainers that litter the music scene today or then. The Grateful Dead on a bad night were better than many bands on their best. Evaluating this show in the context of age, physical condition, & historical significance, this performance provides a poignant image of an old soldier of the road fading into the dusk.",

One moment he would hit a bum note or forget a lyric and the next he would play/sing something so beautiful and fragile it could make you cry. He never forgot to remind us that he was just like you or me. \n\nWhen he starts talking to the lord, it give me the impression that he knew what was around the bend... and to me, he was letting us know that he was going to be ok. I know that some will not agree, but this is just my opinion. I'm grateful to the Archive for making this show available, thanks.",

The rest of the boys kept the motor running; Vince's harmonies, as they often did, tended to hurt my musicians ears.\nI'd gotten kind of used to Phil's heavily dipthonged word endings, before the new liver and voice lessons, and enjoyed hearing him get Three songs in one show with the Box of Rain for his bandmate nearing the end of his road, like Phil's dad when he wrote that song.",

Plus, at 10:27 in the song he sings, \"LORD..so many roads...\"  Sort of a surprising vocal ad-lib for him.  Anyway, the show may have been fairly weak, but So Many Roads is a 5.  Some of it will give you chills when you figure that, as weak as Jerry obviously was, he really gives it his all in the later parts of the song.  PS: there's another So Many Roads from somewhere in '95 that has Jerry doing some falsetto lead vocals atthe end.  I only heard it once, several years ago.  I've never subsequently been able to place what show it was.  But that version of the song was pretty potent, too, as I recall.",

Don't buy into all the sentimentality and hype. This review has nothing to do with loving Jerry or the Dead, or being thankful they were around as long as they were, or the effort they gave, or being kind, anything like that. It's about the music, and the truth is that this show flat out sucks. Garcia sounds as if he is on the verge of a coma and an asthma attack simultaneously, and the rest of the group seems disinterested in the proceedings. Except for a brief flash of power and emotion near the end of \"So Many Roads\" that many others have commented on, there is no energy anywhere to be found ANYWHERE in this limp performance. There IS a difference between musical improvisation and just playing aimless notes while ignoring what the other musicians are doing. There is also a HUGE difference between taking musical risks and just not giving a shit. Several members of the band have admitted that by the mid-90s they didn't really listen to each other on stage anymore and that the Dead simply wasn't very good down the stretch. It's perfectly acceptable to still love the Dead and what they meant to all of us without paying lip service to this toilet of a show. Unless you are a completist or a blind follower who just worships any and all things Jerry, do yourself a favor and don't waste any time tracking down a copy of this auditory embarrassment. Even with all of the soundboards taken down, there are literally hundreds of better shows here at the archive.\n\nRevised- As to the reviewer who feels obliged to indulge in name calling because he can't stand the fact that my opinion differs from his...so what if you were there? We're reviewing the download of the show, not trying to stay positive. I'll not indulge in blind hero worship. My opinion is that this particular performance ranks with the worst the Dead ever did, and if you can't handle that, too bad.",

Listen to it once fvor historical value.  Then find a much earlier show and enjoy yourself. But I'll still give stars for sentimental value.\n\nMy original review follows:\n\nSadly, the Dead went downhill, due in a large part, to Jerry's addiction.  In my opinion, the nineties material can't touch the seventies or even the eighties.  However, I grew up with the Dead and am still emotional about the death of Jerry.  As such, even though this show isn't up to the quality of the Dead in their prime, it has great historical value.  For this, I give it a top rating.\n\nI am still struck by the last line they played: \"such a long long time to be gone and a short time to be there.\"\n\nPS: sadly, I have lost respect for Phil and the rest of the survivors for playing the Jerry songs as Phil & Friends, The Dead, etc.  Let Jerry rest and get some new material.

They had $500,000+ in overhead a MONTH just to keep up all the roadies that worked their way onto the payroll. And although heroin took a horrible toll on Jerry, it was made clear in his autopsy that his chain-smoking Pall Mall full flavors for 40ish years was what really killed him. That being said, for someone a month from his death, he lays it all out there, just like he always did.

The magic was gone by 1995; the Dead at this point were nothing more than a money-making machine running on inertia.\n\nThe sound here is good, but by 1995 there was really no excuse for subpar recordings, either from the board or the audience. The first set is DOA. We will get by....oh really? Care to prove it?  The second set feints at life a couple of times, but never achieves any real momentum. There's nothing especially noteworthy about this \"So many Roads\" either- don't believe the hype! I suspect people want to find somehting to like about this show or attach some sort of significance to it because it was the last one, but the truth is that the boys really didn't play as a band by this point. They were essentially just six highly-paid individuals who didn't listen to each other much on stage. \n\nThere simply isn't anything exciting going on here musically. The drummers fail to propel the action, Weir and Phil sound uninvolved, and poor of Jerry just can't find the spark anymore. What's worse, a sizable chunk of the audience seemed too swept up in the glow of Garcia's celebrity and the Dead mythology as a whole to notice the difference.",

Jack Straw opener, prob the best ever played. Rain n Snow, Walkin Blues, n just a rockin Loose Lucy.\n\nThen there is Masterpiece from her night. Amazin. West LA, BIODTL, Tenn Jed, Music to close da first set.\n\nMy sister toured from there and saw this the very last show. And I toured from July 19th 1994 to July 9th 1995.\n\nCan any of you tell the difference in our thoughts of Grateful Dead?\n\nFor her, the Dead got worse and worse every year. For me, the Dead actually got better and better. 1994 was so boring to me as the first year I saw them. 1995 was a much more interesting year for me. I could hear that Jerry wasnt doin the guitar as much, but that just made the rest of the band play as hard as they could.\n\nAnd what about the vocals? If you all listen, as Jerry;s guitar got worse and worse from 91 to 95, everyone's vocals got better and better! I never heard Bobby sound so good as 1995! And Phil! WOW! 1995 was the only year I also thought Vince was actually not flat and nasty too! And Jerry, oh wow!\n\nYou all have to understand, for me, I saw them in their most out of it in 1994, then I caught 3 shows of spring 1995. But after I graduated in class of 1995 from high school, I saw 2 detroit shows, skipped Pittsburgh, and then saw every show from there!\n\nDeer Creek, the gates are crashed, my car is breakin down, but I drive the piece of crap to St Louis goin 55 mph the whole time! 2 horrid shows there, only to have that thing crash down on the heads at that campground!\n\nGot my car fixed n drove to Chicago!! First show in Chicago was awful, prob worst I ever saw the Dead! And the Dead sent that letter to the fans about them hating people who showed up w no tix at their shows! I was 17! This whole experience was crazy for me!\n\nOk! so this last show was the only show I didnt have a ticket for. And there were a million people lookin for tix that day! BUT!!!! If any of u know Soldier Field, there are bridges that cross over the train tracks, that bring people in who are walkin in!!\n\nMe havin a brain, I figured, well anyone who is on those bridges, is someone just comin into the parkin lot....so if any one of those people are someone sellin tix, then they are just showin up, and they still have tix!\n\nOh YEAH!!!!!! Sure enough, I stand on the corner of one bridge w my finger up yellin the miracle call, and this guy sells me, ROW  K, for face value!!!!!!!!!\n\nTHis was the best experience I ever had! 17 on tour, and the last show I get ROW K! I ran off like Charlie n the Choc factory and I just found the golden ticket!!!!\n\nSo after this whole disaster tour, Deer Crk gate crash, St Louis pavillion falln, and many poor ass shows, oh yeah...the Touch of Grey opener was fuckin amazin! \n\nI thought, for how bad they had played in 1995, this was the Dead's best show of 1995! The 3rd repeat of \"I will Get By\" in Touch, after that whole week, just said it all!!\n\nVince on Little Red was amazin! Bobby cracklin the \"Newspaper Men\" line in Masterpiece w Vince on high just brought me to tears! For me at 17, Phil's Childhood's End said it all! And then the ONLY Cumberland of 1995! And I thought it jammed!!!\n\nOk Promised was slow, Shakedown was awful, n Samson (well I wont go there). But come on....that So Many Roads may not have had Jerry howlin like some of the 1994 versions.....but when he is sayin \"I Found a Road, Lord I been Walkin Down the Road!\" u have to give it to him...that improv is just so amazin.....and he seemed in tears durin that too....u know...his voice wasn't stretchin as it was in 1994...but we all know why....I still thought he hit some great notes!!!\n\nThought for the first time Samba was kewl, and def, for the very FIRST time, I love the Corrina! Have u listend to that JAM into DRUMZ??? Prob the best jam of 1995!!!! I didnt leave the floor for drumz or space...\n\nThen unbroken has such a beautiful start!!! the whole song is well played, prob second best to the version played w Bruce! The Sugar Mags brought me outta my seat....Bob's emotion at the end!\n\nAnd Jerry's tearful Black Muddy River! But nobody can talk shit about Phil's double encore w Box of Rain!!! Come on! I dont think he ever did that song better, and I have heard many versions!!! Most versions have a slow, almost dying beat....but that one, he pushed so hard! \n\nAnd u have to admit, the 2nd encore is such a surprise! I watched it! People were like 3 feat from their seats, goin home, and when that came on, the cheer was amazin! I saw men cry at that moment! I danced like I never had! It was the best moment, and it was the last moment!\n\nThis is my fav show ever, but again, I only saw shows in 1994 n 1995.....so i hope y'all understand why",

I'm not trying to make anyone cry because it was \"the last one\" but in the big scheme of Dead shows, it ranks near the bottom. It really is awful.\n\nGarcia is wheezing his way along and his guitar playing is quite sloppy and uninspired. The rest of the band more or less just sits there going through the motions, glad that the tour is ending-a finacial success but an artistic nightmare, just like most of the tours from the post-Brent era. First set is out of snyc and out of tune in spots, ditto the second set. I'm not sure what people are hearing in the \"So Many Roads\" and can only conclude they are mistaking exhaustion for emotion.\n\nWe can argue about the 60s vs. the 70s. vs. the 80s all day and all of the night but by 1995 there really wasn't a Grateful Dead anymore, just a bunch of rich, aging hippies playing mediocre, unthreatening, uninspired muzak to an audience too in awe of their very presence to dare criticize them.\n\nThe Dead began declining just a bit in the 1980s but were still an incredible band. that's fair- no one can stay at their peak forever. 1990 was the last year worthy of note. '91 and '92 had their moments but things were really unravelling fast by the this point. '93-'95 forget it- just six guys, five of whom used to be in the Grateful Dead, immitating the Dead.\n\nAlso, what's with people telling these long stories about how great it was to be there and then doling out a five star rating? And what's with some of the crybabies who get all upset when you trash a show? Garcia once said that one of the things that bothered him about being in the Dead was the lack of much negative feedback, that too many of the fans just seemed like they loved everything the band played no matter how bad it was.",

A poor performance not just measured against the 70s and 80s but against any spot on the band's career other than these last 2-3 awful years. It's likely those who are rather hysterically defending it are doing so because they either feel like they have to because it was the last show or because they simply don't believe the Dead are capable of producing anything substandard.

End of discussion. If you liked them, great, then to you they didn't suck.\n\nWhat isn't great is this final Dead show. Just hollow and lifeless; not much I can add to what others have already noted. If this show hadn't been the last one there wouldn't be 10 reviews here, much less almost 200, and the average rating would be one and a half stars. The show just isn't good.",

      "review_text": "F minus Interesting to see the strong feelings this show elicits.\n\nWith all the other shows here I don't see how this can be rated highly at all. I'm giving it a one. I have listened to it twice, thinking maybe I was missing something, but am almost certain that I will never listen to it again.\n\nWhy? Well, for starters because of the overall lack of energy. The drummers are lethargic, Phil's contirbutions are relatively uninspired, Weir sounds almost as though he is playing with a different group, and poor Jerry's playing just isn't very good here- there's simply nothing interesting or impressive going on in his playing.\n\nSecondly, I don't rate shows relative to their era. A great show is a great show period, whether its 3/1/69, 11/6/77, 3/27/88 or whatever. Same applies to bad shows, and this most certainly is bad show (as are most from '95 and '95, sad to say). I'm not cutting this one any slack because it came during the weak 90s.\n\nStill, all reveiws are just opinions, and opinions definately can bring out some firey passions. I'm not writing this to piss off fans of 90s Dead or \"take sides\" in the back-and-forth that seems to have taken place here. I'm just throwing in my two cents that what I hear here is very poor in light of what I know this band was capable of on a good night.",

      "review_text": "A sad ending, but beautiful beginning. I was lucky enough to catch the last three Dead shows ever - St. Louis and Chicago.  I was traveling with a tour friend, and we got to share these final moments with Jerry together.  Now over 10 years later, my tour friend is now my wife and we have an incredibly beautiful 14 month old son.  I cannot express how badly I wish my little guy could have seen Jerry, however he definitely loves the music (his favorite song seeems to be Shakedown Street).\n\nAnyways, it's strange how life takes you places you never would have guessed...  So this show, Jerry was absolutely dying in front of our eyes.  My incredible denial kept me from admitting what I knew in my heart/soul that he was leaving soon.  I tried to ignore the lyrical mishaps and sometimes inaudible guitar (he'd turn himself down a lot), but the one thing he never denied us was his soul.  There were those tunes that Jerry just identified with and his brilliance just poured out into all of our souls... His frailty, his humility and willingness to just drop his guard and tell us what his heart had to say.\n\nSo Many Roads was one of those moments, in fact the most powerful soul experience I ever witnessed from Jerry (in my 69 shows).  He was just laying it out there as a gift and affirmation maybe, a resignation to the fact that life is fleeting and so precious that it should be lived in every moment.  At least that's what I take away from it.  \n\nUnbroken Chain was actually pretty well played, and of course was a surprise coming out of space, really sweet.  I was totally bummed in the moment when Jerry was winding down Unbroken Chain and Bob jumped in with Sugar Mag...  If you listen very closely to the end of Unbroken, I swear you can hear Jerry slowly trickle down and wind up on what i swear was the opening chord of Morning Dew, or possibly China Doll.  Imagine if he could have given us just one more final Dew...\n\nThe double encore of Black Muddy River > Box of Rain made up for Jerry getting snubbed.  BMR was the first one i'd ever heard, so it was quite a moment regardless, let alone that he couldn't have picked a more fitting and tragic song.  His last story was about him taking a walk towards death and finally sing himself a song, just like he did for us for so long.  Strange to think of his perspective of the whole Dead experience... very different from ours!  But regardless of our \"point of view\" we were ALL connected directly on a soul level in those deep and magical moments, which gives me consolation and will always remind me of the incredible mystery this \"life/dream\" really is. \n\nPS: I have to rate this show as a 5 for the simple fact that it IS a 5 to me personally.",

However, compared to other shows in general, it is still the Dead, and I'd rather be a one star Dead show, than a Bon Jovi, or Whitesnake, or Kelly Clarkson show.  So it is what it is.

We knew our parents would never let us (at 16 years old!) go to Chicago to see the Dead, so we decided to lie and sneak out and drove 3.5 hours to Chicago.  I had the best time ever.  It was an amazing experience that I will remember and cherish forever. This is actually the first time I have listened to the show since it was played live.  Just sitting here listening to the music and knowing that I was there gave me the chills.  I wish I was able to go to more shows, but I am forever thankful that I atleast made it to one show...the last one...that makes it even more cherishable!

Much like Three Rivers, I think musically.....not so bad, vocally.....not so good (especially Jerry).

      "review_text": "I just don't get it [EDIT again, and I wonders why?]\n\nFor one, Gaybo, lol, that makes me laugh, even though it is not very original.\n\nBut unclesam77, isn't the review suppose to about criticism? That has been one of the points through out this posting mess.  To tell the show how it is.  And yes, there are some songs, that I think I mentioned (not by name), where you can hear Jerry really feeling it.\n\nAll in all, I understand all of your points, and it really isn't worth any of our times to keep flaming back and forth.  I was just trying to convey, that this show isn't really that great to listen to.  And that, besides a couple of songs, it really sounded like the band was going through the motions....which excludes the condition of Jerry, his goes without saying.\n\nI just wonder sometimes, if the fans of such mass gathering would except change as much as the whole idea of seeing their band live, maybe some of these \"jambands\" (sorry I hate that word as well) would still exist.  I mean, with the talent this band had, I think it was a waste to only corner them into a certain catalog or \"package\" of songs.  I agree, the catalog was vast, but I am sure they wanted to live a little a change, but couldn't.\n\nWhy? I don't know, Dylan did it, despite all the \"booing\" and whatnot, and has done it more than once. \n\nAnyway, rambling on. Peace all! And for those of you, don't take my work for a grain of salt. I mean, who the f@#! am I?\n\n[EDIT for those speaking to me]\n\nI really do want to start a war on MY OPINION, so I will try my best.\n\nCT, why the door? What did I say wrong, other than giving my honest opinion of the show? I really didn't think it was all that special, and even stated the obvious, they sounded tired.\n\nHow is that wrong to say? Again I do not understand the mentality of half you people, and your negative responses to someones mind.  I did not come down, negate, nor take away ANYTHING from either one of these musicians. Nor did I EVER say that I could do better.\n\nI did say, that I am sure they were and have been sick and tired of playing the music to all of you, wouldn't you? I mean, don't you think after playing a song for so many years, you would get tired of doing it? I say yes, even if they were blessed with the ability to chaneg it up and never play it the same twice.  Again, you just don't get it.  Musicians are artists, and they need to create. If they don't it gets stale. And I am sure playing DarkStar a million times would get old. Don't you think a painter would become tired of painting the same painting over and over, year after year, even though he changed colors, brushes, and added or subtracted things each time? Again, I would say yes. Why, because I am one myself, and the best feeling in the world, other than having a magic moment on a jam, is creating something new and fresh.\n\nAs for you Dylan, I am sorry I hurt your feelings in regards to Phil.  And FYI, I listen to Phil & Friends quite a bit on this archive, so I have no issues with Mr. Lesh and I absolutley love his bass playing.  Again, I only commented on the vocals, and how bad they sounded in contrast to the music. So, I guess stating my opinion is wrong? Whatever.\n\nAs for listening to this and that, that is not the point of this review. It is to comment on the show. Not to say, compared to this show in the 70s' or that show in the 80s' this song or that song was better.  I do agree however, to point someone to a better show in light of this VERY UNENERGIC UNCARING show. But alas, since most of you are such experts in this matter, I will keep my mouth shut. Besides, the best way to enjoy everything, both good, bad, ugly, and beautiful is to try and listen to as much of these shows as you can.\n[END]\n\nThis is meant to be a review of the show not a whining and bitching session.  \n\nI never have gotten into the \"scene\", and I in ways, I am glad I didn't. As it appears that most of y'all only care about yourselves and whom has seen what and how it was...blah blah blah\n\nI am going to listen to this show, and I will then make my 1st rating based on \"HOW I THOUGHT\" it was.  It will be pure and honest, with nothing weighted due to this or that.\n\nHate to jump into the fire with the rest.  But if you honestly think about it, it was you that made the band go down hill.  You all became greedy, even when with all the tapes in circulation and side projects...you couldn't get enough.\n\nIt is sad, some of these jam bands get around the whole corporation only to still be held down by the scene.  Odd, music is the most beautiful and pure thing, but when it is too good, too special, it almost becomes tainted. People don't want to others in, nor do they want the music to stop.\n\nYou have to understand, these are people, yes people you are watching, listening to. They have lives, feelings, goals.  Let them be, let them do, specially if you love them so much.\n\nPeace\n\n[edit]\nI heard the set and I must say, really was not all that.  However, seems the vocals weren't there, specially for Jerry in some songs, sounded a little low.  Overall, Jerry sings when he wants to, and it does sing and play well when you have him on a song he wants to do.  I guess, you know, after all those years of playing so many of those tunes, he got bored. Do you blame him? Heck, I know I would, even if you were blessed enough to \"supposedly (sp?)\" never play the same song twice.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed listening to this, except when Phil sang. I am sorry Phil, just can't handle your vocal. I realize you have had issues, surgery and all that, but honestly, how can you live with yourself singing over something and killing it as you do?\n\nI am giving this show a 2. Why? There was no energy, they sounded like they were tired, and a bunch of old men...which they kind of are/were.  Also, what were they thinking about when they agreed to the keys player? In the opener, it sounded like someone was playing along with a casio keyboard they got from christmas and it made it on the tape somehow.\n\nAnyway, thanks all for giving me an interesting read about a show. Odd parallel you fans have with phans. It is too bad that Jerry couldn't have done what Trey did, and kill the monster before it killed him. But even if he did, I am sure all the hate that would have come out of it, would have brought him down as well.\n\nEnjoy the music people, please, stop whining about it...you miss the point if you stand around picking it apart.",

Im not sure why I waited. I couldnt be at this show because, well I couldnt be at any show after somewhere in 1992. The scene was just too far gone at that point. \n\nListening to So many Roads and Black Muddy River was very intense.I really cant put into words the emotions that ran through me as I was listening, but im sure that there are many of you out there that dont need an explanation. \n\nOne thing about Jerry being gone though. A lot of you people say how you miss Jerry. Well even though Ive seen so many shows, I never knew Jerry, the person and The Grateful Dead had died some time before he did. I cant really say that I miss Jerry becuase I never knew Jerry, the person. I cant say that I miss Jerry as a musician either because just about every single day of my life, The boys, led by Jerry, take my mind on a journey and make my soul glow. There is no one that will ever be able to take my mind on the explorations that Jerry did with his guitar. No one will ever take my soul to those places that I never knew existed. I cant dwell on what might never happen again though. I choose to just be thankful for what did.\n\nThank you so much Jerry :)",

Sure Jer was great in 1967, but he was great in 1977, and 1989 too. My best friend's life was changed by 8-4-79, not the greatest show by my standards. But the point is this: it's a kind of music where they spoke to us directly in a bizarre kind of social communion (and still do in the recordings). Any Dead show has the magic if you put yourself in the right place. A confession Rob Bertrando once made on Deadnet in the 90s was instructive: he and his taper friends were griping during the June 1974 tour that they wished they were still at those Portchester 70 shows. And as they griped, the Dead were laying down some of the most fabulous music in God's eyes, and they weren't hearing it because they were thinking about being somewhere else. What makes this music precious is always there---it's up to you to hear it. If you're interested, I have more theories about this stuff: http://facpub.stjohns.edu/~ganterg/dead.htm",

A couple of reasons I suppose. These shows arent exactly dreamed up a week before they happen...It's called the 1995 tour because the band makes a yearlong commitment to the tour and the fans a year in advance.\n\nI know the free-sprirted nature of deadheads prevents a lot of them from understanding this kind of commitment, but it is probably the main reason Jerry kept on truckin' despite his ailing health. \n\nI think we should be even more grateful for the nights he had to struggle through a performance. He may have had no idea how grave his health situation had become. (even if he did know, he may have decided he was going to keep playing till his last breath.)\n\nAfter all, he crawled off what seemed to be his death-bed in 1986, learned to play again, and gave us another nine years.",

I will say I would have rather been there than seeing some shit MTV band. These guys rocked it for a long long time and sadly this was the end. I can relate to Jerry now that I've been through Opiate addiction, it is not a fun time being sick! I really enjoyed Dylan opening the show on 6.15.95. That was great. Ok show, not as good as the 1994 show here in VT @ Highgate but I obviously had a blast. Then Jerry dies and I had nowhere to go but Phishing!

I thought the 8th was better than the 9th mostly...the 9th seemed a little sluggish, you could tell with all the vibes on tour that jerry didn't feel well, and no doubt according to phil's book, there were serious death threats against jerry garcia.  crazy wacky world...there was no doubt that everybody sensed a hiatus with the hopeful prospect of a great studio album of all the tunes.  I really thought that album was going to be good, the drums really tightened up like 1977.\n\nIf I remember there were beeps over the PA and it's on the both sources SBD and AUD at the end of the show probably to signify curfew maybe, also there were fireworks after the show with hendrix's star spangled banner, a nice treat to end the end...only a second encore of johnny b goode could be more fitting! I must say the PA sound was excellent at the show, I was on the phil's side in the stands, and it was clean and clear sound out the PA.  Probably the best large concert I  had heard then and mostly now too!\n\nI definately remember gazing back on the crowd thinking how long could this last?  I felt this way even before the show after witnessing the debacle of deer creek riot.  That was a real low, and fans didn't get the next night's performance, we went to bed without dinner, and recieved a poignant rebuke by letter from the band.  I don't know why fans would do this with all the police presence at deer creek, there were k-9 cops at least 5 -7 guarding the hill in the back of the ampitheatre and yet still fans stormed the back of the place.  This was the only time I felt threated at a rock concert, like zebra in the serengetti while a lion is on the prowl.  Also, the deck collapse in Mo. before the last shows was terrible although the GD not responsible, it hurt the whole scene.\n\nAnyway, the show is what it is...and there will never be another grateful dead\n\nbill graham said it best about the dead...\n\n\"there not the best at what they do; they are the only ones that do what they do\"\n\nDonnie L.",

No.  That was the essence of the music, trial and experimentation.  So, firstly...thank you MGOSHEY.  Your comment was beautiful and I am looking forward to running into you at a show somehow in the future.  Putting Jerry's lyrics to work in our life is all the creators could ask for.  \n\nTo a dude like AcousticPob...you stopped feeling magic after Brent died?  God pal, you really suck.  \n\nMagic happened all over after Brent god blessedly rest his soul..and....there is no single decision I'm more proud of then jumping in the car and driving from Upstate New York to Chicago for these last two shows.  This set list is killer.  No show was ever without flaws.  NOt with our boys but did you really want to listen to an album or see a show?  Appreciation happens from within.  Don't click off everyshow if you hear the crew miss a note or lyric.  \n\nShakedown street is awful.  They sound like they'd just as soon stop singing.  Listen to how Bobby, not Jerry...Bobby drops the line in Promise Land and they fall about till the magic re occurs.  They put on a mean Samson when they just naturally (out of creating it) never needing to doubt it, pull all types of magic together in that Jam.  People who discredit they're shows really have to examine why they think the Dead played and made their music...to jam till you die.\n\nGo Ratdog, Phil and Friends, The other Ones and the like....peace again MGOSHEY...I hope to catch you at another great show somewhere some time.  \n\nTo AcousticPob one question...do you play acoustic music by chance?  And if so, do you play so people will sit home and listen to your album or record so they'll come out to see you perform?

Music is about 90% opinion (no right or wrong), I can't remember the last time someone won a debate based on opinion.  Just express how you feel and read how others feel, that's all.\n\nIMHO, considering the circumstances, this show could not have been any better or worse.  They performed how they performed, that is what they always did.\n\nDid they play well that night?  I think most can agree the answer is no.  There were both highlights and low lights.  However, is that what the Dead were all about?  Playing a great show every night?  It is what they attempted, but rarely achieved.\n\nI feel that this concert is the embodiment of a dying artist.  His voice withering, his guitar crying, and his frame just standing there, hunched over.  It was the end of this man's life, how dear we expect anything more from one who gave us so much for so long?\n\nHis performance on July 9th was reflective of his state, a true artist...giving us what he had, no more and no less.\n\nLet's be thankful he gave at all.\n\nI for one am thankful because I was a sophmore in '94 when I first got exposed to the Dead, and this turned out to be only my second show (and obviously my last).  So I'm happy I got to see them while I could.  Thanks to the archive, I haven't missed a beat!!!\n\npeace",

It's just a little more complex than that. But if I have to, than 2 I guess. The recording is great. You know, when I last saw them in Pittsburgh the week before on the Jumbotron, I thought Jerry looked like he could barely move. His face looked so different than it did not that long before. He had on a light blue t-shirt and I think his pants were maroon. He had granny glasses and his guitar was different. It really was odd seeing so many differences with him. Listening to this show made me feel tired. There isn't much energy. The rest of the band can't sound lively if their lead guitarist doesn't, so they all sound dull. I noticed that Jerry often turned his guitar down so we couldn't hear is weak playing. I know some people might feel I'm being too critical on this show, but it really doesn't do much for me. I feel the sentiments that Acousticpob expressed. I heard Phil say on VH1 that the last 4 or 5 years of the band didn't give him many memorable nights and Jerry didn't have that spark like he had before those. I have to agree. This show doesn't have a spark in it. The recording is excellent though.",

As I learned about his life, I realized how many people depended on him, and he was a yes guy. He always was willing to help others through his music. A benefit here, another show here, he felt personally responsible for the entire GD family. He was seen like a work horse, Playing sets for the purple sage opening act then playing all night for the dead in the early 70's. He's been quoted many times saying he loves making money at something he LOVES to do. It wasn't a chore for him. They really didn't make the big bucks till the '80's so for many years he did it for the music. As the Grateful Dead became a global empire, so much was expected of him, at meetings everyone wanted to gear up and he felt like it was time to gear down, maybe go to rehab or have a life with his kids. The deadly sin of Greed is cunning, he may have not been worried about the money, but the empire was and without him it was nothing. In the end, a year he should have been resting or kicking dope, he made that \" One more tour this summer, then you can do what you need for yourself\". I would hate to be the guy that proposed this. Jerry was quoted saying,\" There's always one more tour, one more show, one more benefit.\" laughing it off as if its life, he pressed on because we needed him and he knew that. Also being off heroin myself for over 12 yrs., I understand his health. He was too unhealthy to be running like he did. It seemed like there was never any time for him to become well again, to ensure a future of music for his most important people in his career, his fans. The band, being in much better health then him, wanted to capitalize on the always sold out \"madison square garden's\" around the country. They were ranked in FORBES as a huge money maker, They never thought Jerry couldn't make it. He always worked harder and longer then most. The band always turned a blind eye to his sickness. All of this is such a tragedy, maybe even destiny. What a run and a myriad of shows to enjoy. Jerry truly changed the world and not many men can say they did that in their lifetime. \nAs his present wife makes millions off his neck ties, we mourn a man with a true sense of giving. Its too bad he couldn't give to himself in return. I rate this show high not out of comparison to 1974 but to 1995 and all he gave us this year. We should have boycotted his shows until he went to treatment (out of love). I doubt that would work, but maybe he and the others would have listened to that. RIP Jerome Garcia.",

I blew off the 1st Chicago show to see Luther Allison @ Buddy Guy's, should have gone again. At least those Blues dudes played with a fire that Jerry lost in the early 90's.

As a recovering addict myself, I knew the pain and suffering Jerry was going through. Too bad his heart gave out before he could get clean. I have many fond memories of my years going to see the Grateful Dead and still keep in touch with some of my old Touring buds. I listen to shows all the time and even do a Dead/Zappa radio show in Jackson Hole, but this show, as in the case of much of the 90's shows, is proof that drugs destroy lives and talent.

Now that I have found this incredible archive of events, I can cherish with greater fondness the amazing legacy of live shows left behind!!!

They miss the entire point of the Dead experience.  Yes, a certain musical perfectionism was part of that, and it was rarely on display in some of the later shows (though this last show was actually quite decent and Jerry pulled something out of a hat on SMR and BMR).  But above all, the Dead are about community, and it didn't matter whether the show on any given day was great or not.  It was ALWAYS great to be there, to be part of the crowd, to dance, to sing and do whatever else turned you on.  Nitpicking individual performances is fine for those who are looking for great shows to download, but beyond that, spare us your crap, you clueless imbeciles.",

If someone noticed it and asked who it was, or commented on the playing, I knew it was a winner.  If they said \"what's this dreary, out-of-tune junk you have on?\" I knew it was...well, dreary out-of-tune junk.  I found the Dead got noticed and applauded by these non-Deads through the '77 shows (mostly '69-'72).  I got the most complaints whenever I played something from the post-Mydland era.\n\nThis show, I know without even testing, would get a universal thumbs down...  Old Jerry's vocals and guitar are distracting in their spectacular ruin; it truly is a heartbreak that transcends words to describe it.\n\nThe Black Muddy River/Box of Rain ending is about as well-scripted for an ending as possible, and their poignancy sends shivers up my spine.\n\nBut, let's face it, the music is a wreck, even there.  It is utterly painful and spirit-quashing to hear; Garcia sounds so utterly defeated, which indeed he was...  There's no way to justify the music on this at all, and it is unplayable to all except the most diehard Head...\n\nI downloaded it for its documentary value, as ghoulish as it is, because with all artists I collect, I want each stage of their music represented.  But I can't imagine listening to it again except when it makes its way through my shuffle function...  And when it does, I'll feel that same sting I felt so suddenly in 1995, and mourn the passing of a great musician who had already died except in corporeal form by that point.\n\nSuch a waste.  And I hate the \"he gave his life to music\" arguments.  He did not.  He gave his life to drugs.  As Lesh said at the time, in the end, the drugs meant more to him than the music did.\n\nAnd the rot had set in as early as the coke days of 1978; I could never slip a '78 show across in my non-Deadhead litmus tests, people asked me to put something else on...\n\nIt's hard to see that when your world was or is the Dead; and yes, there was more to the \"experience\" than just the music, something outsiders can never quite know.\n\nBut if it is music that interests you, this show isn't the place to look for it.  Pay your respects, by all means.  But there is no music here.",

I started seeing the Dead in the late 70's, I saw shows in the 80's that were nothing less than breath taking, but as the 90's wore on, great nights became less frequent and far in between.  \n\nThe drugs, smoking, over weight and diabetes took its toll on Jerry.  And as much as I loved him, still more than any other musician, the music, Phil and Bobby were given new life after Jerry's death.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to see just one more mid 80's show from Madison Square Garden.",

I just thought I'd tell some of you about a show that happened at Soldier Field 2 days after the Dead's final show. Pearl Jam played on July 11, 1995 - and the Dead let PJ borrow their actual stage. I've read that this was far from the Dead's best show, but in Pearl Jam lore, PJ's 7/11 show indisputably lands in their top 5 of all time. Eddie Vedder said on the stage, \"I don't think we should play another note until we thank the Grateful Dead for letting us use their stage. They left it for us...there were still joints left on it from Saturday...So we only think its right for us to play as long as they do.\" They wound up playing over 2 1/2 hours.

How many of you would see jerry on stage mid song and he was resting both hands on his guitar? Did you notice that you could barely hear him play? The only music that garcia got off on was when he would go out on the road with his band and what was weak about that was jerry was having fun and the music had energy but then a dead tour would follow and we thought \"wow jerry had fun he was happy and most of all the music was really goo\" then it was such a let down when he would come out on stage no smile's and most of all NO ENERGY AT ALL. We would be leaving after the show's tinking where we would eat instead of trying to talk about the show only because there was nothing to talk about they were usually way lame .If he was not responsible for peoples health insurance many jobs in the dead enterprise there is not a doubt in my mind the band would have stopped touring after brent passed . I wish i would have stopped going to shows but with already having been to 411 shows  you always had that hope that all of a sudden jerry would start having fun again ,but that was not to be. I get by on the memories of the 380 shows i saw before vince welnick came on the scene because after vince joined that was the end of the Grateful Dead as i knew it.The absolute last straw that did it for me was when in the middle of the music never stopped weir took the band into easy answers at that moment that was the end of the band.PERIOD",

Bruce on grand piano and Jeff on the keyboards rock and Trey can play his ass off. These shows will be wonderful. I'm praying they do a simulcast.

I went to my first dead show almost 23 yrs ago will be 32 years in 3 days 4-988 worcester centrum. the bus came by I  got  on that's where it all begalthough not the best show I seen but an. I spent from that day until 7-9-95 touring just east coast shows. I told mt best friend I wanted to save money for a show away from the east coast. We chose 7-9-95 chicago as the show. that whole tour seemed different for some reason we arrived in chicago on the 7th went to the lot on the 8th tied to score tickets but no go so just enjoyed the scene outside. 7-9-95 arrived at soldier field early afternoon partied all afternoon dosed and hour before the show.  not the best show I've seen but not the worst either. When jerry sand so many roads a feeling of emptiness came over me and tears flowed I tod my friend after he finished this is it it's the end of the road. then fast forward to black muddy river and jerry missing the lyrics for a minute I knew it was good bye. my friend asked me after the show what was going on and I told him my feelings he said it was the doses. little did we realize one short month later it was the end of the road. I miss you jerry and leroy thanks for the memories thanks for the golden road I give my love with unlimited devotion.",

As I take my life's inventory I find that my cup is overflowing because of you Jerry.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  \n\nThe rating is for the entirety of my 15 years of experiences on the road with the GD.  And this So Many Roads does a magnificent job of encapsulating it all in one song.  \n\nPeace, stay healthy in these crazy times.  \n\nRon",

This was the end of the Grateful Dead a band that left so much music we have volumes of material to enjoy. ---The copycat supposed \"jam\" bands are an outright disrespect to the legacy. Jerry was authentic he played from the heart every show. Like Jim Morrison said \"why don't you go write something?\" ",
