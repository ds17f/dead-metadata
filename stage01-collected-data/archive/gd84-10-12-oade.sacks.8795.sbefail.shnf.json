      "review_text": "my lucky night Every so often, when you can't go to all the shows on any tour, you pick one of several, and voila. I'd say this was the best show I ever saw out of 100 or so. Once they broke into On the Road Again, I knew it would be a good one. Little did I know that would be the last time they'd do it. Then came Jack a Roe, my first, and hmmm, Roses,On,Jack A Roe, that was three in a row off Reckoning. Interesting. Then It's All Over Now, which I always thought ok. But to close with Cumberland and Music Never Stopped...now that 7 song set was better then some 11 song sets (see next night 10/14 for instance) Second set begins with a nice Cold Rain, followed by always welcome Lost/St., then Brent's Don't Need Love, a very personal song for Brent, but....what a bummer. Talk about a mood killer (sorry Brent, RIP) and quickly saved by Uncle John's and a rousing sing-along for this 7,000 or so grateful Heads. After an energetic drums and thoughtful space came, what I've come to find out per Dead base, is what they refer to as first Playin reprise, which in this case refers to finishing the song by playing the reprise this night, after having played up to  that point the night before. The crowd caught this, and was stoked, but now in fitting fashion they tidily finished Uncle Johns from pre-drums, all nicely segued. This crowd is all cheshire grins, in unison singing come hear uncle john's band.....pure delight running rampant as it winds down, and then, whoa.....Dew. As much contrast between these two songs, the emotional intensity did not subside, but got more intense with a very poignant delivery by Jerry. When he sang the final guess it doesn't matter anyway this crowd erupted into thunderous applause, as with one mind we realized we'd just witnessed one for the record books. I was immediately reminded of this sequence from shows circa '74 where this combinaiton was done. Good Lovin' as an encore was certainly appropeau, and we proceded to boogie. Unless say Pigpen had walked out onstage to sing this one, I think my brothers and sisters in attendance couldn't have been more elated. I guess for all the miles I traveled to see shows, and never witnessed a Dark Star, this was a big  chunk of my payoff. Thanks to all who were there that helped make this such a good time. Thanks for allowing me to elaborate on this, because this is what it was all about, boys and girls. Didn't listen to this copy yet, my five stars are for a five star show.",

It all flows together incredibly well, with the peaks really nailed.  Listening to the whole show for the first time I'm really struck by the difference between the first and second set.  First isn't very interesting, the second is full of energy, creativity and surprises.  Still love it, and the jam out of UJB into drums is primo GD.",

It seemed you could see his aura clearly, and the climax of the tune caused my hair to stand on end.\n\nI helped make this very recording in my own small way. I was travelling with my good friend Doug Oade on this portion of the tour, and I helped carry gear and also since I was the tallest taper in this group I stood behind the stand and helped protect the 'pile' of equipment as we were FOB way close to the stage and it was really intense down there.\n\nI also had my sony D5 plugged into his rig, and still have my master tapes of charlotte - augusta on this fall 84 run.\n\nI disagree with the reviewer ragging on the first set. Some of these were rarities when played here and the whole set had the wonderful feel of this being a 'special' show where songs normally only played acoustic in the past could be pulled out.\n\nThis show is a treasured memory in my Dead listening career and this recording is equally a treasure. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nmountain jim\n\n11/20/07 update. Reading here and the other reviews, some mention lack of bass/hall ambience in this particular Oade recording. I can say that we got an FOB spot that Doug decided later was perhaps too close to the stage and somewhat inside of the stacks, so this show has a higher component of stage sound relative to system and hall sound, I believe. Since this was where I stood, it sounds just like the show I heard. But keeping the equipment and stand protected and steady down front like that in that joyous mob was not easy. I am so thankfull I made it all the up from Georgia for this run.",

One of my top 5 shows of all time (Out of hundreds). Seems most of the show is so well and accuratley captured by the other reviewers that I can't add much. Never forget the total joy that broke for the Good Lovin encore. It was like the crowd \"Popped like a cork\" with joy.

While I did not attend this show, I did catch the Meadowlands and Syracuse shows at the end of the tour with friends. they were great shows as well, but in hind sight, I wish I had been able to attend the Augusta shows as well. Hinx, if you're out there somewhere, I'd love to hear from you.\n Any way, I want to add to the long list of great reviews for this show. My take is mainly on the first set. Back in the mid-80s when I started trading shows, I had what I think now was a copy of either this aud or the other one that is posted of the first set only. It was easily one of my 3 favorite tapes. I think it eventually just disintegrated due to over play. The song selection is awesome IMHO. A kickin Stranger to get things started. On the Road Again, Jack-A-Roe. Both are sweet. I have always loved All Over Now, and this version smokes. Cumberland (a very underated song in my estimation) just jams, And MNS to close the set just brings the house down. I can't give enough superlatives to this rockin first set, and I haven't even listened to the 2nd set yet. Based on previous reviews, that seems as if it will be tasty as well. I can't wait. So happy that I found this posted here. It can now resume it's place in my collection as one of my all time favorites. 4.5 for recording and 5.5 for show = 5 STARS.",

This is a quality recording and yes you can hear the crowd - It is an AUDIENCE RECORDING (there are some issues with levels).... From the start of 15 min Stranger this show kicks total ass (never a bad show I am aware of ever played in Maine) The All over now is off the charts as is the cumberland and music. At first glance this is short but set I sizzles.\n\nSet II is legendary and I forget why I missed these 2 shows (I made some of the others) running into friends afterwards they just gave you this 'you have no idea' look when you asked... I got the tape right away and was blown away especially by the Dew. 84 was inconsisent but man when they were on like that last night at the Greek when they encored with Dark Star they were on - This equals that show.",

As you approach, a small wooden dais topped by a very large book will appear. Behind it will be standing a very impressive angel, patiently awaiting your arrival.\n He will ask you a few, quick informational questions. There may be some additional queries posed of a more searching and personal nature. Eventually, he will ask if you either attended or have listened to the Grateful Dead 1984-10-12.\nIf you say yes, you will be promptly admitted into\nParadise with no further delay. If you say no, or merely looked baffled, there will be a prolonged, awkward silence while St. Peter regards you with pity and exasperation over the top of his glasses.\nAfter a few seconds, he will utter a sigh, shake his head sadly, the clouds will part beneath you until you fall all the way back to Earth, where you will be forced to relive your life until you finally listen to this show.\n Yeah, it's that important.",

These two shows were the Magical nights you want to be in the audience experiencing what the Grateful Dead gave us on any given night. who knows what you will get, but all I know I was treated to the Magic and Spirit of that whole entity known as The Grateful Dead. I remember being in the parking loton the first before the show and there were these Heads from Florida who's micro bus's trans axle had broken, they were parked right next to us and I remember them asking us if we would help them roll the bus on it's side, we did then went into the show, when we came out they were still working on the bus. It was such a bummer that we gave them some kind party favors and I had four extra tickets for the next night and I MIRACLED them. The next day we all pulled together and fixed the bus, went into the show, raged, and had our minds blown with in My opinion, the Best Dead show I experienced.

It was the 6th show of the tour and the only song previously played on this tour was Feel Like A Stranger and even that was the *closer* to the 1st set in Charlotte. \n\nOther notes: the P.A. speakers were so low to the ground in this tiny gym you could almost reach up and touch them. The Morning Dew was pin-drop quiet at points but eventually inspired the crowd to clap in unison during part of the solo. I know that sounds obnoxious but i think it worked. I swear I thought the whole place was going to life off the ground during the end of Good Lovin' and I get goosebumps typing this. Once they left the stage it was a simple rainbow of lights above the stage and I remember thinking \"maybe they come out and play Dark Star\" like they did in Berkeley almost three months prior. Yeah right...\n\nThis recording does this show justice",

I did the Worcester shows that week and had no plans to go to Maine until a buddy told me at lunch on Friday that he was going up, so I tagged along. No ticket, small venue, but in those days persistence generally paid off and I had mine well before show time. There are no words to adequately describe this night. Those that were there just know. The hook was in me for life and this remains, after more than 100 shows, my all time favorite for the combination of music, venue and scene. I just saw that they are finally releasing this one as part of their million show box set for $700. Too bad, because I've been waiting for it for years but my archive download and a first generation audience tape still serve me well.",

They always treated Maine well, playing in other backwater places like the Lewiston Fairgrounds, Alfond Arena ( a weird little hockey rink), Oxford Plains and a bunch of killer shows at the Cumberland Civic Center. \n\nThe Augusta Civic Center is so small that the normal stage setup couldn't fit so not a lot of flown equipment. It gave everybody an intimate view of the band. There is some video of the show on youtube.\n\nJerry was a mountain... huge... the heaviest I ever saw him. And his hair was long and stringy. The poor man was downright unhealthy looking. But OMG did he pour it out at these shows. As I think back on these killer shows... I think Jerr Bear was sober... at least more so than usual. \n\nEverybody rightly raves about the Dew but there are also other jewels - the Uncle John's/drums/Playing/Uncle John's is some other the best playing I've seen. Jerry and Bob were picking and grinning, digging their craft, digging the crowd. Maybe they flubbed the words a bit but that always happens. Don't miss the Jack-A-Roe & Music Never Stopped.\n\nI miss those days",
