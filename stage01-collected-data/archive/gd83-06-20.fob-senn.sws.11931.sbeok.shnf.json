During warf rat there was a huge crack of thunder and a lightning bolt split the sky behind the stage (on the tape you can hear the PA got out for a second). Phil must have heard the thunder because he tries in vain to equal what God sent down.Definatly add this show to your collection as it is amazing and I wont go into the outragous Sugar Mag except to say you have to hear it to beleive it!

When the lightning came down it would short out the power for a moment.  You could not have timed it better.  As for the show....  Although the second set is legendary for the Sugar Mag, the first set is just as great.  This show is, in my opinion the finest example of a unique era for the band.  The band was playing without te bells and whistles that were to come in 85.  Every song is stripped to its basics and played ferociously.  Brent stepped out and gave us a taste of what we would see from him in the years to follow.  Phil was dropping bombs with reckless abandon, Bobby was HAMMERED (but not sloppy), Mickey and Billy were relentless, and Jerry kept taking things to another level.  Two notes:  At the end of SSDD Bobby was banging his guitar on the stage.  But in perfect Bobby fasion he could not break it.  The lightning strike during Wharf Rat was the single most intense moment I have ever experienced at any of the hundereds of shows by any band that I have experienced.  GET THIS SHOW",

The moment of lore and mythology, the one in rat where heaven sends down a bolt and Phil responds without missing a beat with the bomb, probably would have sent me into a place where I very well wouldn't have gotten out from...so maybe it's a good thing I wasn't old enough to have been there.  Then that Sugar... and then that SSDD, and those final furious, monstrous screams that are with me whenever I need them.  Finally, Garcia drops one of the heaviest Baby Blues I've ever heard.  What a show, what a set, what a post space.   Unimaginable power.  Inconceivable intensity.    The most brutal attack of the decade and one that changed some lives.  The fact that there is no board of this show (or spac) is one of the great shames of Western Civilization, but at least Silberman (thanks Steve) was able to capture this the way it was.  This feat, in and of itself, should get him to heaven.\nDstone5553@aol.com",

That's right, someone at Ticketron fucked-up and the tickets started spewing out of the printer!!  We were flabbergasted.  And these just weren't any old tickets, they were 8th row CENTER - the first 7 rows were reserved for the Dead's entourage.  Ho-lee Shit, what a SCORE!\n\nCome the day of the show, my buddy informs me that he just scored some *bonus* mushrooms, woo-fuckin'-hoo!!

As the music started, a light drizzle began and the rain intensity mirrored the music intensity. They were completely in synch and the cloud just sat on the venue until the end of the show. When the music stopped, so did the rain. The lightning would strike behind the stage (you could see it through the sectional background) and when Jerry would hit a power chord the lightning came in sheets. The sound system went out a couple of times and kind of bubbled back to life as the speakers regained power... The storm was synched to the band and the lightning strikes came with power chords!! The lawn was a mudslide and at the end of the night you couldn't see the bridge over the creek because it was completely underwater, railing and all! All that was in evidence of the harleys parked near the creek were the tops of the handle bars.soaked to the bone fun!!",

I remember the rain starting and getting us all wet, but then the sun came out and dried us off.  I felt intensely good and now I was washed and dried.  Man I was ready to go off.  I remember thinking of a kind of baptism.  All kinds of things were going off in my head this night.  Anyway, the rain came back with a vengeance and there would be no drying off for those of us on the field.  China-Rider, Samson He's gone and trucking were beautiful.  I danced my wet and muddy ass off.  Fun stuff.  After the drums and into space I was in a kind of trance.  I don't think I had blinked since Trucking.  If you listen to the spooky jam prior to the Bob Star you will hear a sharp and brief feedback from Bobby.  I swear it was like he personally popped me right between the eyes.  I blinked.  The lightning seemed special ordered by God and I thought God was sitting in with the Grateful Dead.  Coooool.  Bob star and Phil kick us into The Other One and we are off.  Way off.  During Wharf Rat when they sing \"I'll get up and fly away\", The lightning hit the stage right on que(is that how you spell que?)?  I told you God was sitting in with the band.  Well of course Sugar Magnolia and Sunshine Daydream were rockin' in a most large way.  And Bobby with the \"Do know the people they call the Aborigines?\"  \"They think this side is the dream side.\"  The copy I have of this show has some girl I think screaming just as he finishes saying it.  Perfect.  And Baby Blue is always a favorite.  Good times at Merriweather.  They played the next night to and I was there.  But this night(which was the summer solstice if you didn't know) was a highlite in my Grateful Dead show career.  Bobby hit me right between the eyes.  Gone are the days.....",

      "review_text": "Parking lot Harleys This show was a blast.  We just got in from Saratoga Springs two nights before, and the weather looked ominous.  The place was electric, and the band did not let down.  The sound was perfect, and the band was on.  Other than Jerry's one botch of the bridge transition in China Cat it was just about exactly perfect.  The lightning strikes were practically choreographed...I still don't know how Jerry arranged that.  I think this was the show when Bobby fell over the drum set during Sugar Magnolia, but I can't be sure.  I remember walking up a mud hill after the show because  the bridge was out to the parking lot, and everyone started mooing like cattle.  Classic Dead moment.  When we got to the parking lot after walking in knee-deep water, my buddy looks over at the Harley's parked in about 5'feet of water and says \"it looked like such a nice shady spot this afternoon!\".  \n\nBottom line, fantastic show, definitely worth the download, and watch the volume in Wharf Rat when they get ready for \"I'LL GET UP AND FLY AWAY\".  Phil will destroy your speakers.  Enjoy.",

      "review_text": "from the lawn i've read most of the reviews. i was 23 at the time of this show and had seen many shows. this show was incredible. i was in the lawn, with a new girfriend who wasnt a deadhead. it rained so fuking hard the whole time that even stuff deep inside of my wallet was wet.  we left during sug mag- bless her heart, she was shaking from being drenched to the bone. the most memeorable part of the show, for me, was Music never stopped- phil and bob were spooning and rocking back and forth as one unit on center stage -just jammimg their ass off. just incredible. maybe one day a SBD will surface (pssst, charlie miller, are you out there) or even a video.",

      "review_text": "Ears Still Ringing! Oh what a show, the most memorable ever for me. I lived accross Rt. 29 and walked to this show, and swam home. \n\nI was in high school and had been to a few shows in DC and Baltimore, maybe Hampton too. Then the word came - MERRIWEATHER. Getting chills now even. Somehow me and my buddies scored pit tickets at the Hecht Company in the mall - ticktron I guess.\n\nAll the reviews are right on. Floods, mud, lightning and more. I broke free and had a space all the way up near phil's side speaker. I know the guard thought I was insane dancing like a fool. Unreal, unreal, unreal - I love this show. \n\nIf there's a video please I'd love to see it.",

      "review_text": "What a night Had so much fun at this show, the girl I went with had never seen a dead show and the mud slide absolutley amazed her. The thing I remember after finally getting to where you could exit the lot was the river that flowed through. I gunned my engine and floored it, sent about a 7 ft wave up and hit all the people leaving and was lucky enough that forward momentum caried me to the other side. Have never driven through water on a road again. Had so many great times at Merriweather up to Dear Jerry.",

      "review_text": "cross country watermelon man ok so this was the most surreal dead show (outta 75 or so) i ever did see! the second set was so over the top with the lightning and the band playing off each other, but that's all been said. my lasting memory was, after the show, as the creeks were rampaging over their banks, i sawed a hippiezoid with both feet inserted into watermelons propelling himself through the deluge as if cross country skiing! seemed to make perfect sense at the time. no really i sawed it. on our way home we determined that police officers should be relegated to dispensing orange juice at roadside stands and they would direct us to the next show. the next morning we called merriweather and axt if the 6/21 show was still on or if they were mad about the sod. i am so grateful that the dead are part of my life!!!",

Everyone has talked about the rain, mud, and fun but I have to say that the show, both natures and the band was beyond words! Phil's bass in the second set could take the top of your head off. All players were in the groove. In the almost 50 shows I had seen this still ranks as my personal top dog. Grateful for the experience and vivid memory!",
