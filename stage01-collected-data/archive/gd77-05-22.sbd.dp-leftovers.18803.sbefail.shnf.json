This particular series will take your breath away.  However, there are many more gems to be found throughout this show.\n  The opening Music Never Stopped is tight and comes complete with a near perfect mini-jam at the end.  The Sugaree is nothing less than brilliant; of all the versions of this special song, this one ranks second only to the slightly more blissful and longer version played two shows previously at the Fox Theater in Atlanta.\n  The second set is sweet as hell also.  Check out the segue from an abbreviated Terrapin right into Morning Dew.  This Dew is also quite remarkable, with a long, spiraling jam that starts out very quite and mellow and progresses into a full-out assault on the auditory senses.  This show deserves a listen, and another, and another.  It wasn't by coincidence that Dick picked this show as the first '77 offering to the public.",

While there are some minor vocal flubs in the 5/8 show, this show is absolutely flawless.  \nShow starts out with Phil thundering on the bass during Music, and the Sugaree is by far the best ever.  The peaks Jerry hits will knock you on the floor.  No other version comes close.  I'd put this Dancin' up against Cornell any day, and the Help>Slipknot!>Franklin's is one of the best of 77, with  5/9 and 6/9.  \nJerry is masterful in the second set.  His tender fluttering along the frets at the end of Eyes, with a little help from Billy and Mickey, bring the band flawlessly into Wharf Rat. The Wharf>Terrapin>Morning is a perfect end to a phenomenal show.  Buy this Dick's Picks, if for no other reason than a monster Sugaree",

      "review_text": "Brilliance !!!  Perfection !!!  Nirvana !!!  Happiness !!! And frankly, that is an understatement.  Not only is this Florida show inspired and technically - flawless - in both its singing and playing (which is rarer than hen's teeth,) it has got to be the finest soundboard recording of the band ever done. I have been listening closely (with the volume way up) for years, and I haven't heard The Boyz misplace one single note.  For five musicians to not misplace a single note for an entire show, well, I would have said that was absolutely impossible. But they did it!  Moreover, like throughout the whole month, they are completely relaxed and totally focused tonight... Like Ali at his best.\n\nAnd the audio goes far beyond anything I have yet to hear from any other recording.  Well balanced vocals and instruments with just the slightest touch of reverb. Sweet and mellow comes to mind.  Put them all together, and you have pure magic.  I have so many favorites in this show (Sugaree included...and yes, it is the best ever done), I'd just be boring you.  Well, maybe I'll add that this show turned me completely around on Lazy-Supplication.  And now that I'm thinking about it, after having this review up all these year, I rearranged the first set by putting H-S-F as the 1st set opener with Sugaree following it.  God, what a start to achieving perfect bliss.  I definitely agree with Dick for his first '77 pick.   \n\nOf the two thousand three hundred something shows The Boyz ever did ..... 5.22.77 is my - Numero Uno - #1 favorite show with 5.8.77, 9.2.80, and 8.19.80 right behind it.",

Lots of other standouts, too; MNS, HELP/SLIP/FRANKLIN'S, LL/SUPP, and an INCREDIBLE second set that is like one big flowing river. extraordinary EYES and WHARF RAT, and capped off with a great AM DEW. seek out this pick and get these leftovers for another complete show to add to your '77 collection.",

Last Post said: \"Keith teases what one day became Foolish Heart during Franklin's which is pretty cool.\"\n\nI'm sorry to rag but this is a totally ridiculous statement. Both tunes (Franklin's and Foolish Heart)are based around an A maj chord to D maj, except Franklins throws in G maj inbetween A & D. So obviously jams in etiher tunes will sound very similar. But that doesn't mean anything Keith played in '77 became Foolish Heart 12 or so years later. Keith wasn't teasing anything, he was just jamming in 'A'. There are only so many combinations you can come up with when you just jam around one tonal center (A). \n\nPlus Foolish Heart sucked and Jerry was in no position by the time Foolsih Heart was written to clearly remember anything from '77!",

      "review_text": "Underrated ... Look at the Set List ... Listen!!! Maybe this show doesn't get so much love because it was chopped and a super early DP.  If you take these leftovers and your DP and burn the whole show to 3 CD's with everything in the right order, this show is absolutely amazing, maybe the best of the month (yeah, that's right).  Music-Sugaree...Cornell doesn't open like that kids.  Lazy-Supp, Dancin'...Cornell same, Cornell Dancin' better but not much, this Lazy-Supp better.  And don't forget, now we're talking about a 1st set with Peggy-O, Friend of the Devil and Ramble On Rose.  It's electric.\n\n2nd set.  Just an all-time Help-Slip-Frank outta the box, Cornell gives up the immortal Scarlet-Fire.  Touche.  Cornell goes right to Estimated-Stephen-NFA-Stephen-Dew, yep that Dew.  Excellent stuff, but a bit short, no?  After the H-S-F here we get a cooking Samson, not 1 of my personal fav songs, but this version sizzles.  Then a nice little Brown-Eyed/Good Lovin' sequence.  I usually don't love Good Lovin' post-Pigpen but this is really good.  Then Sunrise, very sweet, and you can see the diversity of this 2nd set compared to Cornell.  Then we get the monumental Estimated-Eyes (great 77 Eyes w/ nice soft jam into...)-Wharf Rat-Terrapin-Dew, not 5-8 I grant you but it's close, this Dew is superb.  Up at Cornell we get a Saturday encore, here it's Sugar Mag, a longer, better song.\n\nConclusion:  I'm not going to take a definitive stance.  Both 5-8 and 5-22 are great, great 77 Dead shows.  My point is that it is entirely possible to suggest that 5-22 is the better all-around show and should therefore be in the \"Best Ever\" discussion for those that think 77 is in that discussion.  Ya follow?",

But this is better than Barton, whose reputation rests just as much on its long-time availability as the tape everyone had. \n\nYou want proof? Listen to the almost one-hour run on the third DP3 CD from Estimated > Eyes > Wharf Rat > Terrapin > Morning Dew. \n\nAin't nothin' like on it on this green Earth. Even on 5/8/77. \n\nIf my word's not good enough, even Dick himself said that this show \"tears apart Barton. It rips it to shreds.\"\n\nI, too, have taken the 8 songs here and placed them in the appropriate order in a DP3 playlist to get the complete show. And what a show it is. \n\nThe name SPORTO should be writ larger -- much larger -- than Barton.",

One of the reasons I don't play DP3 very much is because it is not the complete show. I'm fussy that way. Frankly, I can't even lay my hands on it after a brief search for it,  being so long since I've listened to it.\n\nLook at all these Jerry songs that didn't make the cut...Peggy-O, Freind of the Devil, Ramble On Rose, Brown-Eyed Women...WTF?\n\nSo, during this month of May 2012, I am downloading every Spring '77 show that I can and am kicking myself for not owning the shows that made it to official release. It is nice that GDP or whomever else is in charge (GDP doesn't exist any more, IIRC) has allowed these songs to remain available on the Archive. \n\nOnce I do find DP3, I look forward to assembling the show in its proper sequence. Then, and only then, can I make a fair comparison to other Spring '77 shows.\n\n5 stars. Duh.",
