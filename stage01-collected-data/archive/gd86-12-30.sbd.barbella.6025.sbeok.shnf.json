      "review_text": "5 stars get thrown around like this is hollywood. A poignant Bucket opener for a show no one could have imagined would happen months earlier. Those first notes of Althea never fail to get me in the mood for deep listening. I also really dig Bob\u00c2s tone on this version. It is a touching version. There are a few C.C. Riders that blow down doors. This really isn\u00c2t one of them. Not a waste of time to listen to either. Just eh. Cumberland on the other hand. Not that it matters b/c the song is so awesome. But this one is very bouncy and Jer is thumping around with a very tightly wound tone. I am personally a huge fan of When Push comes to shove. And this is a very nice version. Nothing great, just nice. BIODTL moves into Greatest Story seamlessly and Jerry kicks in the mu-tron with a little extra thwamp. By the time Jer comes into TMNS he is really flying over the fret board. This version is sped up a good bit. The first set is not what this show was about though. It was strong, but nothing otherworldly. \nThe China>Rider is average but interesting all the same. The Saint/Sailor is awesome. But the Estimated is incredible. It\u00c2s the spaces ya know\u00c2not the songs. The Prophet is a prefect example of this idea, they leave the song behind and start hearing each other and playing off each other. The show up to hear is up and down and over all average imo. But the prophet is 99.9% perfect. The eyes following is strong as well. Nice crisp drums and some nice fills from brent. The drums section gets way out there, it may as well be referred to as \"sprums.\" H. el Din takes the listener to the Serengeti for a walk and maybe alittle pipe sharing. Ollin Arrageed is very capable of producing totally dumbfounded looks on my face. And it rolls right along into a Phil heavy Iko. Suddenly the band sounds 10 years younger. It starts with the E.Prophet>Eyes and now they are spitting acid fire. Brent is really adding some great licks. The Neville brothers get in on things and you know its just a mad house. The enthusiasm in Jerry\u00c2s playing makes everything so fresh, not to mention Phil bombs. Hey now, hey now, IKO iko\u00c2.great version, jer really digs in now and they flow absolutely effortlessly into Men smart that rocked. If you are not a big fan of this tune give this one a try. Huge energy that just melts into Stella Blue. How Garcia managed to create so much power with quiet I will never fully grasp. It\u00c2s the test of great musicianship vs. legendary. Great composers, live performers, writers must have the ability to use less to make more, less words, notes, instruments etc\u00c2Plenty of rock acts have been able to see the concept and apply it but no one even came close to Garcia. No one. What an amazingly powerful song. And this solo, in complete contrast to the solos played in 1973 ends up achieving the same sensation. And then, quiet. (due praise to hunter) Brent adds a synth organ, then acoustic piano, the electric\u00c2. and magic happens. Had I been there I don\u00c2t know if I could have handled more at this point. Stella Blue is still resonating when the whole band jumps into throwing stones. Jerry\u00c2s tone is thick and thin, metallic and smooth all at the same time at this show. Nice seque into a popping NFA.\nThis show gets a 4.5 for sound quality.\n6/10",

I drove out to CA in a 240Z from Texas and threw a tent out front of the Kaiser and slept there for two nights. Bill Graham told me Good Morning. Inside the show this night, in the back of the floor area was a volleyball net and a game was going on for an ur or two prior to kickoff. I had a blast. Folks had their babies in there, was a total family scene. The Neville Bros did a great show, I loved them. Yeah, Jerry was diggin the guitarists help at the end of the second set, but I don't recall hearing him at all, but he looked like Sammy Hagar. I remember very well the way Jerry accented hid \"T\" in Ship of Fools, \" It was later than I thoughTTTTT\" which in my state resonated well. Superb China>Rider and Saint. I remember this show seeming great but very mellow at the time, not frenzied and mind bending like a Red Rocks show. Oh well, great memories. Does anyone remember the guy on Rollerskets with the Pignose amp on his back playing electric guitar and skating around playing twisted guitar licks and singing in strange languages??",

This was a surprise night.\nB)The night before NYE is always the better show.",

He had it going on and wow, he could really play guitar. I saw him in the parking lots at Kaiser and also down in Irvine. Funny thing, I saw him in 2006 at Speedway Meadow at Power to the Peaceful (Spearhead). He looked exactly the same!!!",

      "review_text": "Harry Perry & questionably 30th > 31st? Well I don't often respond to some of the, with all do respect, gibberish that some folks write (especially to those who obviously weren't even there) but since these two other folks were obviously there I guess it's worth it! That is, they were wondering about the guy on the roller skates playing guitar in the audience. Most likely this is Harry Perry from Venice Beach, Ca. I do remember from time to time seeing him at shows and I used to live in Venice up through shortly after this time! Harry was famous in L.A. for skating in Venice while playing his guitar (like I myself used to do from Torrance Beach (southern end of Redondo Beach) to El Segundo and back again playing my guitar while riding my bicycle and never crashing even when it was very crowded)! In souvenir shops in Venice they used to sell post cards with Harry pictured on them. (I can't say as far as I know, anyone every made a post card of me).\n     Also I have to thank the guy who provided the Neville Brothers set list; now the question is to him since he apparently knows, is where is the tape of them? Like him I share his enthusiasm for good opening bands! Yet they very rarely are mentioned and sometimes not even mentioned by others when they guest or conversely, when Jerry or other Grateful Dead members have jammed with opening bands which happened at at least seven shows that I can think of that I attended!\n     Now as far as this thing about whether or not the night before New Year's Eve was better or not, yes this did often turn out to be the case but not in any sort of predictive sense. That is back, I think it was a few years before this I had mentioned to a woman that so far the 28th show of the five (but in '86 there were only four) had turned out to be the best over all, but I didn't intend for her to expect this to be the case, yet she did and chose to only go to the 28th or at least skip the 26th & 27th or something like but that year it turned out that the 27th was best or at least better than the 28th. So it wasn't so much that the 30th was so great, rather it was just that New Year's itself progressively started to suck so much more each year after '81-'82, but ever the 30th in '79 was better than that New Year's and that New Year's was way better than this year!\n      What I remember most distinctly about this show was the 30 beat intro for \"Beat it on Down the Line\" and \"The Music Never Stopped\" with Weir adding the improvised words during the 4/4 part of the jam! Even though I always liked Hamza El Din, I guess I was spoiled in the sense that I saw his best performances with Grateful Dead which most definitely were the earliest ones namely, at Winterland (which were the only times where he played his Oud and played other tunes as well) and the best of all (speaking of a very great 30th) was 78-12-30 at U.C.L.A. -> St. Stephen! But that wasn't because of St. Stephen rather it was because not only did it have several other unknown folks involved, but most especially because it was long and developed with Grateful Dead participating with him as well! So again I still liked Hamza El Din but \"Olin Arageed\" progressively just wasn't what it used to be, unfortunately it got gradually more and more boring!\n \n     Augy\n     San Diego",

      "review_text": "IGNORE ALL BUT FIVE STAR REVIEWS Okay, so maybe you hate dogs, or you don't like ice cream. Everyone has their opinion, right?\n Here is an opinion...anyone who speaks negatively about the Dead in the eighties doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground.\n I am sorry for those who are still mourning Kieth. If you couldn't let him go and were (and still are)always comparing Brent to Kieth, then sure, the eighties may suck for you. \n I guess I'm getting it now that I write this- It ended in a way for a lot of people when Kieth died. Sad. \n So have pity on an eighties hater. By not ever opening their hearts to Brent they missed 3 of the best years ('87-'89) of music the planet will ever hear.\n Everyone else is just high. If you were a head in the eighties, it's sort of an unspoken joke about how some call them weak years.\n For people looking for the best sounding recordings on this site- this is one of them. Everyone has opinions about show quality, but there are some things that go a bit beyond opinion when it comes to recording quality. We can debate wheather the eighties sucked or not, but there is NO DEBATE as to wheather a recording sounds like crap or not. TRUE? Phil is either up front filling that sound field or he's not folks. The cymbals sound like seperate entities or they don't folks. Why don't we use the stars to help each other find the good RECORDINGS and tell stories about our favorite shows.\n This is a five star RECORDING. If you like good RECORDINGS regardless of year, here are some suggestions; listen to all the seventies soundboards especially Betty boards and Matix re-mixes, search for highly rated Aud recordings for early eighties(soundboards are usually keyboard heavy and/or vocal heavy), sink deep into all of the great later eighties boards. That's where you'l find the best stuff.Recording quality wise that is.",
