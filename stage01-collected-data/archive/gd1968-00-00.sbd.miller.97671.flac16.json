Obviously, it's not from 2/14/70. You can tell by the mix that it is from 1968.\" \n\nThis is mistaken. It sounds little like 1968 (the guitar sound is quite different); and Tom Constanten is on organ, not Pigpen. Late '69 would've been my guess.\n(If you'd like to hear Pigpen play organ in Midnight Hour, try 8/21/68 or 6/4/70 - he plays much more simply.)\n\nIn fact, this Midnight Hour is the encore from the Family Dog, 9/6/69. David Lemieux has included this a couple times on the dead.net Taper's Section. \n(The Archive just has the first 40 minutes of the show. The Vault just has the last two songs, Casey Jones & Midnight Hour. Jefferson Airplane played after the Dead - in fact, on the Taper's Section clip you can hear Garcia saying after MH, \"Jefferson Airplane, coming up next.\")\n\nThis is a poor performance. Despite its length, there's almost no jamming (Garcia in particular is disappointing), and half the time is taken up by Pigpen telling the audience to stand up while the band just piddles around.",
