This is definitely the real thing as far as music is concerned from this era and so forth ! The song list should speak for itself, besides this definitive, performance of the Same Thing etc. (I don't use that word lightly).\n     Even though it's a cover, that's part of my point. ie. how not only in this case but later on throughout the span of Grateful Dead; how they could take a cover and make it their own, and sometimes dare I say better than the original, yet obviously not to deminish the composer. I shouldn't have to cite examples, but to name a few : Around and Around, Not Fade Away, Cold Rain and Snow, Morning Dew, Turn on Your Lovelight, Sittin' on top of the World, Dancin' in the Streets, etc.",

      "review_text": "Pre Summer of Love Dead! I found this to be a very interesting show. The band changes imensely by the years end. So, it's well worth giving this a listen to hear the metamorphasis. One big reason for their sound at this point was Jerry's choice of guitar. He's using a Guild hollowbody. The sound is very clear and articulate (similar to the sound he'd get later with Fender Stratocasters). By the years end he's using a Gibson Les Paul. Thick tone aided by the fact that he was probably playing much louder to keep up with the second drummer!\n  Anyway, at certian points in the recording Jerry's guitar is way too loud and glaring. There are a number of volume adjustments that are pretty annoying. It's very true about the great choice of covers the Dead would choose to do. Unfortunately, Friend of Mine wasn't one of them. (Sorry if I might have offened any \"Friend of Mine\" fans, it's just IMHO).\n  Despite some faults, this is still highly recommendable. It's historically important and has was a pretty good show to boot! Four stars: check it out.",

Although it runs a little fast and jerry's guitar is too loud in some spots, I think that if the cd's pitch was corrected and the \"Same Thing\" was added from the box set, this show would get the respect it deserves.  On the original, it all sounds like the one song on the box set, with none of the hiss and muddyness that is present here.  Any opinions?  I don't have the tech to slow it down, but I will glady burn a copy for anyone who will correct it and bounce me back a corected version.",

As someone who remembers when you were grateful to find anything remotely listenable from before 1969, I feel the sound is certainly above average, though far from pristine (God knows I've heard worse). There certainly is nothing wrong with the pitch. I wouldn't recommend this to a newbie by any means, but I've actually been suprised at to find myself reaching for this one several times a year.

The guitar playing is sublime throughout and this show contains what I consider the finest Dancing in The Streets I've ever heard, Bobbys' awful vocals notwithstanding. For most of this show Bobby's vocals are pretty warbly and out of tune unfortunately, not a good show for him. But the other tunes and playing make up for his vocal indiscretions. The Same Thing is outstanding. It's not just Jerry whose hitting creative heights, Pigs vocals on The Same Thing and Next Time You See Me and It Hurts Me Too are some of the most soulful I've ever heard him do. His organ playing is quite good too. Really you owe it to yourself to hear this show, it's amazing. The only complaints are that the sound isn't the best, s'okay for 1967 though and several songs are cut and patched from different source. Unfortunately the end of Death Don't is completely missing. This is a must have show warts and all.",

      "review_text": "Last Cream Puff War,  Hot Same Thing, Viola Lee! A great setlist, combining the best of the 1966 material and is really the last show before they started playing songs that would end up on Anthem of the Sun. \n\nThis is the last known performance of Cream Puff War, which, amazingly, they only played 7 times, according to Deadbase. This is one of the best.\n\nThis show has the first performance of The Golden Road, from the Dead's recently released first album. It's a good song, but they only played it 3 times.\n\nI love these early Dancing in the Streets, which start out Motown and quickly go psychedelic. \n\nPigpen is the Dead's best singer of this era, and this show has lots of PigPen blues, featuring Smokestack Lightning and It Hurts Me Too, bit in particular, The Same Thing. A rarity, but one of PigPen's best blues songs. Starts out slow and steamy, and builds into a frenzy. Pigpen and Jerry in sync. Jerry is hot. The Same Thing is a show highlight.\n\nThis is followed a fast Rain and Snow, typical for the period, and a treat. This one is tight.\n\nViola Lee Blues is another highlight. Jerry and  Phil dueling it out in psychedelic hyperspeed, ever accelerating. Amazing to hear; must have been amazing to see live. (Viola fans, check out also 7/29/66.) Jerry continues his fiery hot streak on Death Don't Have No Mercy, which is not the slow ballad that it is on 1969's Live Dead. It is unfortunately cut off at the end.\n\nI love the Dead of '69, '72-74, late '70's, early '80's -- but this is a side of the Grateful Dead that soon disappeared. We are lucky to have it.\n\nOne disappointment in the recording is that Pigpen's organ is not audible many of the songs. Not only does this leave gaps, but Pigpen's keyboard playing was a central driving force and an important part of the early Dead sound in these 1966 and early 1967 shows. Fortunately, the keyboard becomes more audible in during the second set.\n\nThe Me and My Uncle is painful (they had only been playing it a few months) -- historical interest only.",

Of the 2000 there that night easily 20 percent of the audience was black and this was quite unusual to a 17 year old teenager from white suburbia, but it was okay.

Every time I listen to \u201966 or \u201967 I think it sounds like Surf music and it is mostly due to the Starfire he was playing at the time. That twangy hollow body sound is awesome. The sound he gets reminds me of a cross between Dick Dale and Freddie King. Jerry\u2019s furious earth scorching soloing during almost every song is unreal. The show kicks off with a double time MAMU which has Bobby\u2019s young voice straining and yelling. Immediately you can hear Jerry \u2018s treble solo which fast and ferocious. Pig comes on strong with Next Time You See Me with great vocals and accents from Jerry. No harp solo from Pig on this one, which I found a little odd. Next it\u2019s Jerry\u2019s turn to sing the super cowboy ballad He was a Friend. Well executed and somewhat reminiscent of the acoustic sets to come a few years down the road. Next is Smokestack and it f'ing rules. That riff sounds soo good with the extra twang provided by the Guild. Pig\u2019s hot, and so is this tune. Outstanding. Dew is next and incredible. What a great early version of this song \u2013 emotional as hell and furious playin by Jerry. Great little jam out with Jerry screamin the lyrics at the end. Hurts Me Too sounds fantastic on the Starfire as well. This version sounds closer to Elmore James\u2019 version than any other I have heard from the band. Nice. BIODTL made me chuckle at the beginning because its soo goddam fast\u2026I mean triple time for the 12 year old Bobby Weir on the mic\u2026Speedball from hell right here. After that we close with another Bobby tune, Dancin\u2019. I hate latter era Dancin\u2019 and love early ones. This is a perfect example of why. The tempo, Bobby\u2019s little kid voice coupled with Jerry\u2019s furious playing. Wow, that jam out to close the first set was a thing of beauty. First set done and I am awestruck again by the intensity the band had in 1967. \n\nSecond set starts with Golden Road and I am in heaven. Jerry says something to the effect of \u2018Welcome to the post Chuck Berry Set\u201d and proceeds to rip shit up. Unreal. Next is Cream Puff War, and I was once again amazed at Jerry\u2019s soloing. I mean, it has been great so far but this is from another planet. Furious out of mind blistering treble soloing that left me speechless. Pig comes back up next with Same Thing and they have this one down. Great placement after the barnburning Cream puff War..Slowing it down before the big finish. Next is the surf medley CRS. This one is very, very quick and sounds just like it should be played in one of those old surf movies right after someone yells \u201cOutside\u201d meaning an outside set. All the surfers go nuts and fast surf music plays in the background as they battle the rouge waves\u2026Old surf movie shit right there. Love it. And then they proceed to blow the roof clean off with a killer Viola and cut Death Don\u2019t. \n\nThe things that standout are the cohesiveness that they already have \u2013 playing off each other and sounding very tight for playing so freakin fast(most of the time). Also, Jerry\u2019s earthscorching soloing on almost every tune. The fast, ferocious sound out of that Guild Starfire is awesome. A+ show that gets my very highest recommendation. You will be hard pressed to find a tighter, more important show from 1967. It showcases exactly what they were already capable of way back when. Talent galore with a remarkable edge about them. They take no prisoners and burn the place down on the way out\u2026.All Hail 3/18/67, All Hail Psychedelic Surf Blues",

They are fast and tight, and Cream Puff War and Golden Road are rare treats which sound terrific.  Love PigPen's Hammond work.  This is as good as early Dead gets.",

The track that is most like how the band would be sounding by 1970 is 'Dancin in the Streets'.\nPigpen is the most polished front man here as Bobby and Jerry are still learning their craft.\nJerry sounds much better vocally on Death Don't as opposed to Cream Puff.\nSome of the jams get pretty wild and primal.\nSURFS Up!!",

      "review_text": "A survivor  We're quite lucky that this show has survived with such decent sound quality. This show was the 2nd night of two they did at Winterland, the day after their 1st album came out. The actual album release party was held at some place called Fugazi Hall (in the City) on the 20th. While I agree with may others here that this is a great show for it's time, I'm not as enamored with Garcia's Guild Starfire sound as some others posting below. But you have to appreciate the show on it's own terms. It's great to hear how far they had evolved since '65...their chops, the jams, etc. This show really opened my ears to how skilled Phil had become this early in the game. Just amazing, he's brilliantly all over the place. Viola Lee here is really excellent. But my fave passage in the show is the unexpected long jam in The Same Thing. Jerry goes into some really creative places here, bending the music in a beautiful way. \n   Oh, and Chuck Berry played there both nights as well...(re: Deadbase). Oh, to be a fly on the wall to hear THOSE backstage conversations!   ",

If you\u2019ve been through some 66 shows, you\u2019ll see what I mean. If your a 72-82 guy this will break up your sets. Thanks to the long thread below, you can put together quite the history on this one. and the album they released which a lot of people underestimate, i think? is a great listen and killer album cover as well!
