Which isn't a bad thing necessarily. The struggle is most likely brought about by the fact that they were really pushing. That said, the parts of the 30 minutes where they are all together are really spectacular. For my money its the Eleven and Death that I really turn to this show for. There are many better DS in 72-74 that aren't halted by pig. That may seem abit harsh but I believe it. What makes the DS so incredible is that this is 1969!!!!!!!!Unreal. Its dripped so much psychodelic sweat we could start a community swimming pool. 4.5 for sound. These great pre 70s recording always blow me away. Death Don't does too. 7.5/10",

      "review_text": "1969 must have!! Although I think the Spring 69 period was their high point of the year in general, there are some Fall 69 shows that really stand out, and this is one of them, along with of course 11/8/69, which is Dick's Picks #16.\nToo bad this is only a partial show, but you takes what you can gets in this crazy hobby! Even with the missings songs that are listed above, this would still be a much shorter show than the night before, also at the Family Dog. So I wonder if there is another set that is missing??\nAnyway, as has been well noted by my esteemed reviewer mates below, this Dark Star alone makes this worth the download. When you think of the truly great 1969 Dark Stars - 3/1 and 4/5 and 4/21 and 4/27 - this one is on the same shelf. 30 minutes of\nCapt. Trips and Company taking your mind back to its senses and beyond the 4th dimension. \nWhat you get here is focused, crafted playing within every moment, creating a moving sound collage that rises, fades and spins colors in ever-changing hues and moods. This is what artful improvisation is all about. They listen, they blend, they play off each other in a seamless flow of inspired moments.\nFirst we get a jam for about 10 minutes, just to get in the mood before the first verse. They it's off to Edgar Varese land - don't know who he is?? The Dead sure did. Any fellow music majors out there?? Win a free show - who is Varese??\nBut I digress - the middle territory is a jungle full of strange sounds and entities. Whirring organ, whoosing cymbals, bird-like chirping from Jerry's guitar, water sounds from Bobby. Don't get lost folks! This morphs into a fast MLB-type, or Feelin Groovy, whichever you prefer jam, followed by a rocked-out Know You Rider-ish jam before turning on a dime into -  a fast 2 chord jazz riff that REALLY sounds a lot like Eyes of the World. Did the Dead suddenly jump forwards in time?? You decide.\nThis jam is as smooth as cream cheese on a toasted bagel.\nThen they land you back into the 2nd verse with soaring blazing guitars, before gently fading away as the bells chime. A near perfect version. If 1968 can be said to be the year when they mastered The Other One, then 1969 was certainly the year that Dark Star came into its own. And what we celebrate here is a matured, late 69 version that shows all the signs of a band in its full jam potential, and they prove it for half an hour!\nThis Dark Star needs your full attention - take some special time to get magical, light the incense, light the candles and prepare to be enchanted.\nThe rest of the show is no slouch either. A strong St. Stephen is followed by an amazing, rolling, tumbling wheel on fire that is The Eleven. Phil and the drummers steal the show here - how many ways can they turn those 11 beats inside out? And finally, the Dead get back to their blues roots with a soul-wrenching version of Death Don't that sounds like Jerry's singing his last song on earth. A real spiritual experience.\nWere it complete, this could almost be a top ten show for me. As it is, it's a landmark show that belongs in your 1969 collection. Enjoy!!\nDr. Flashback :-)",

We had all the momentum, we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.\" \n\n-- Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nThis is one of the last few of the pure 60's \"psychedelic\" shows. Within a month the band abandoned many of these songs for the ones they introduced with American Beauty and Workingman's Dead -- fine songs but the 70's were a very different era.  \n\nThey sure went out with a bang! This Dark Star is certainly one of the top 5 of all time in my view -- along with other greats like 2/27/69/ 3/1/69, and 4/08/72 -- it's not just melodic it's utterly inventive and unlike any other version I've heard. \n\nDon't miss this show.",

Then again, its like comparing apples and oranges. Here's a description of Dark star's as I see it: 1969: Rough, ragged, primal, intense, saturated, immature, electric, raw, dense\n1970: same as 1969, but add delicate, deliberate, and structured\n1972: cosmic, chaotic, psychedelic, transcendent, sequential, complex, esoteric, apocalyptic, unpredictable, cathartic, climatic, unrelenting, kaleidoscopic , layered, intuitive, breathtaking, soaring\n1973: jazzy, loose, airy, spacey, minimalist, dark, dreamy, waltz, free flowing, diluted, weird, looming, diverse (from mellow to scary)",

Amazing. \nQuestion: Which do you prefer: St. Stephen>The Eleven or St. Stephen>Not Fade Away.\n\nI prefer the former because I thing it segues better. I feel that the later seguing is too abrupt.

The \"feelin groovy\" jam and the \"tighten up\" jam are awesome, but feel contrived to me, like the band lost the thread of their own creativity and then jammed the shit out of other people's musical themes.  Instead of an organic, flowing DS, it seems more like 3 chunks of a song sitting side by side on a shelf.  Regardless, it's this many years later and I'm listening with intent.  Great music, excellent sound quality for the era: all other analyses are irrelevant.",

      "review_text": "The Family Dog gets a bone. \"Family Dog\" shows tend to be a bit more laid back as a general rule, but this particular night sounds like a bit of an anomaly, as many numbers exhibit a slightly higher level of octane at this venue.  The somewhat rare \"Seasons\" is executed well enough (if you can dig that kind of thing), and the \"Mama Tried\" is a solid reading. But these little ditties are just warm-ups, of course.  The Good Lovin'->Drums->Good Lovin' is superlative, and the best of the year, imho.  Things would only get better with that number, though (READ: 5/2/70).  The Dark Star->Feelin'Groovy Jam->Tightin' Up Jam->Dark Star->St. Stephen->The Eleven->Death Don't is the obvious highlight of the evening. I could hardly write anything worthy of properly singing its praises, but I will offer that that segue of musical merit rivals anything the boys were doing back in February, March, & April of the year.  This show holds its own indeed, and it's really a shining star in a period that's otherwise somewhat overlooked by the fantastic stretch they had earlier in the year, and by the year they were soon to embark upon. I recommend this show without reservation.  \n\nBTW, the last line of \u201cSt. Stephen\u201d that reads:  \u201cWilliam Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch no furthermore and it may require a change that hasn't come\nbefore\u201d is brilliant in that Jerry charges full speed ahead with his vocal, accentuating the \u201cBefore\u201d by sustaining it in a long and robust way that I\u2019ve never heard on another other version.  He then kicks right into \u201cThe Eleven\u201d. I agree with reviewer mikemet that that moment is one for the ages, worthy of repeated listens.",
