Jerry is on home base in SF and batting 100. He starts both sets with US Blues and  Cumberland (which blazes BTW)and that should tell us something. Great versions of many favorite songs like Candyman, Loser and BE Women. And the second time for Roses! Let it Grow growls, leaps and sails. Now take a break, get ready for Set 2. Are you sitting down? The Dark Star>Morning Dew combo is always a show stopper (see 1972 and also 9/10/74) - this one is my favorite of all and the next best 74 Star after 5/14. And just when NFA is still ringing in your ears, they pull out Baby Blue!! Not since 9/26/72. Should have been a Dick's Picks. The 2 other nights are worth getting, but this outshines them both. One of the last great Dark Stars of the 1970's. Heartily recommended.\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

I've had this show on tape for years and Set 2 is all you really need.........except for the China>Rider and Playin'.  \nThe Dark Star>Dew is epic and clocks in at about 45 minutes.  It takes a full 19 minutes until Jerry finds the 1st verse and then after a serious meltdown it's time for your \"mind to leave your body\".  Indeed Billy is driving this entire jam and might be his best ever performance. I'd rank this in my top 5 Dark Star's ever.\nI also really like the rare Baby Blue encore.  A great 2cd package!",

A sweet Morning Dew that slowly builds to a climax not once, but twice. (The 6-18-74 Dew is also great. The best Dews are in 1974.) After that, the rest of the gig is non-stop high energy.

Of all the UJB-like segues from China>Rider from late 1973-1974, this is my favorite, with 5-26-73's premature version as runner up.  5-26-73 was such a unique jam...all heads should check it out if you haven't already.  Anyway this one is just a roller coaster....Jerry nails it!!!!!!!   The rest of the show is cookin'.  Playin' is out of this world!  Dark Star>Dew is spectacular!  This is the best sound quality for any 1974 show on this archive!  Get it!!!\n\nDamn I forgot...check out Jerry's brilliance on Jack Straw.  This is in my top 5 Jack Straws...his licks are so f-ing smooth!\n\nOK, now on the topic of the beautiful UJB-like segue jam from Chin>Rider.  I can not believe so many people do not know about this jam...and also how many people think it is Mind Left Body jam.  It is not MLB jam.  MLB jam is completely unrelated to this segue jam.  If you want a MLB jam, listen to 10/17/74 - Spanish Jam > MLB jam.     \n\nThe UJB-like segue from China>Rider made its debut in a spring 1973 show (5/26/73 is really cool)...and survived through the 5 night Winterland run in 10/74.  Although it is in a totally different key than UJB, it has that sort of groove to it.  IMO, the best ever UJB-like segue jam is this 2/24/74 Winterland!  Damn! Jerry's tone is just crystal clear and in your face...he really nails it with a special touch this night!  The one on the bonus disc from the movie does not touch 2/24/74.",

      "review_text": "The Best Dew Ever Let me tell you about my experience with this show. Back in the mid-1980's I got my hands on a sdbd cassette copy of this show. I carried it with me everywhere I went and played it all the time. Through the years it wore down and I lost the tape. This entire show is not only magical but IMHO has some sort of Divine intervention. This recording is crystal clear and it's mind boggling to imagine how human beings can make music like this. Since I've gotten my hands on this soundboard copy I've listened to it A LOT. The Morning Dew is the best ever!!! (Augusta MN. 1984 is a close 2nd). When I catch a buzz and turn off the lights, light a candle, and listen to this Dew, it's beyond description. Many times I've had an out of body experience where (during the Dew) my spirit and soul is litterally transported back to 1974 and I'm in the Winterland Arena. I can feel the energy and feel what the band (esp. Jerry) is experiencing at that moment in time. I've tried this with other shows and songs but never had the powerful transformation in time like this Morning Dew. This is all without LSD. The last jam in AM Dew I can feel A presence guiding Jerry, that jam is not only the band but SOMETHING else too. The end of the show is soooooo sweet. The end of Not Fade Bobby is litterally shredding his vocal chords, Not Fade AWAAAAAAAAAAAY. The best and sweetest Baby Blue ever!!! Make sure that when you listen to the Dew you have it turned up loud. Jerry and the band bring this to a whisper and he fizzles the notes away. If anyone knows of other shows out there that they have had this type of experience please email me and let me know: scottlacey2000@msn.com",

Their live sound would start to change slightly after these Winterland shows; more rocking, with a somewhat heavier distortion in Jerry's guitar. I'm sure this has something to do with the Wall of Sound being unveiled at the very next show on 3/23. Not a bad thing, at all, just the next step in the Dead's evolution. Most of the songs from Nov. '73 thru Feb. '74, however, sound like Jerry is plugged straight into the amp, with hardly any distortion pedals being used at all, except during the interstellar freak-out jams.\n\nSo basically this show is the last of \"The Honey Year,\" imo. Just an all-around killer show. One of the last truly otherworldly Dark Stars, though not quite on the level of 11/11/73, but you can hardly fault it for that. Also, one of the best China Cat>Riders of the year, up there with 6/26, imo.\n\nThis whole run is great, and I would go so far as to say the previous night equals this, if not surpasses.

I love the GD, and there's no doubt in my mind that even a flawed Dead show is better than almost anything else I can think of. And this show does not have any major flaws. In fact, this show is well-played, technically sound, and really a very good 1974 show (much better than the official Steal Your Face).\n\nHowever, I'm not a huge fan on 1974 shows in general. 1973 was a giant year for the Dead. They experimented and grew in many different ways. Their energy was phenomenal. 1974, on the other hand, found the boys polishing rough edges more than blazing new trails. It is more subdued and less unpredictable, and therein lies my troubles with 1974. Predictability is not one of my favorite attributes of the GD.\n\nIf you are into really polished, well played shows, you can probably reverse my thinking 180 degrees... but if like me, you enjoy spontaneity and chaos, you are better off with a great 1973 show.\n\nWith all that said, the China/Rider here is a keeper... very tasty. And the Playin' and WRS are really good too.\n\nTechnically, this recording takes about 3 or 4 songs before the mix settles in (Mexicali sounds almost like Billy and a monitor feed of Bobby's voice), but after that it gets quite good. By the 2nd set it is stellar. The transfer is perfect.\n\nOverall, well worth adding to your collection!",

Were things getting too laid back that they started getting \"lazy\" in their playing? I think this becomes most evident in the typical \"first set\" songs. Even going back into '73, compare typical first set tunes (Bertha, Jack Straw, Ramble On Rose, Mexicali, Tenn. Jed, etc...) to how all this stuff got played on the Europe 72 tour. Every tune on those nights was played with snap, with inspiration, crisp and tight as if their lives depended on it. As we move through 73 and into 74, all lot of these tunes just start to sound sluggish. \n\nThis period still has its moments of course: the improvisational jams throughout Playing in the Band, or He's Gone>Truckin'>Other One, Eyes of the World, WRS, the exploratory Dark Stars. These still capture the Dead at what they do best -- they are like Impressionist paintings. So, it's 4 stars for \"very good.\"",

For myself this was the high point for the Band. 72's crisp experimentation was a perfect Segway into 73's voyage into improvisational space jazz turned into a rounding off to smoother spaces of 74. As the seventies went on they still had their moments but never would they be what they were, in 73 & 74 they could do no wrong. By the eighties my days of attending live shows was over. To my ears 73 & 74 are all 5 star shows.....",

      "review_text": "Spoiled For Choice! I would describe this show as I would Jerry`s playing style: fluid. I have noticed that some individuals have remarked that the pace is too restrained here. \nAt the time this was recorded, in the early 70`s, there were many musical technicians at work who were all too eager to display there speedy runs and aggressive playing. This is not to knock bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath Santana and so forth. It is only to say that this is why Jerry has been irreplaceable, because his playing was fluid and generally more restrained. All the credit to him and the rest of the GD for not getting caught up in the whole Rocking Blues Band Trip. They were that, but of course so much more. Really, the more that I listen to shows from 70 to 77, the more that I realize it is a feeble attempt to get carried away with comparisons as each one of these years are golden! If you don`t understand why this show is great now, and in fact you dig the GD. then chances are you`ll come back to it later and have a light bulb moment. Otherwise, there is not much more to add to the other substantially good reviews given to this show.",

      "review_text": "Best EVER ????? calling any version of something and for this post I'll stick to DEAD songs 'the best ever.' ITs basically a 'fool's errand.'\n\nas an example, 'Morning Dew.' When I critique' a version I look at a number of things. Garcia's vocal phrasing/singing on the different verses. He might nail 'heard a baby cry' (this version is nice but the version from the show opening version at Boston Music Hall in Nov 73 is  up there as a GREAT, emotional reading etc. Then there is the 'young man.' verse again this is a nice version, 'best ever??\" probably not.Then you have the 1st 'guitar break, ' this version Garcia does well where Phil is somewhat reserved compared to other versions.Then there's the 2nd final guitar break, this one Garcia does well but there are better versions Phil's contribution, bass playing on this is also in my opinion NOT his best. Again check out the 1st Dew from Boston in Nov phil stands out as well as Garcia on the 2nd , final guitar break. Im not saying that that Boston version is the 'best ever' either. But it does have certain attributes that put it 'up there.'To elaborate further regarding that Boston version from 11/73  Garcia's phrasing/singing etc on the 'Young man' verse is good but not up there with best ever versions as the earlier 'baby cry' verse is in my opinion up there in the 'best ever' territory perhaps NOT 'best ever' but it is 'up there.' \n\nThese are not the only aspects I 'evaluate' when I try and critique a Morning Dew either. I havent even mentioned Weir's contributions, Bil's etc or the recording quality.\n\nIf the recording quality is bad it makes it hard to evaluate Garcia's tone,play, ditto for Phil and the rest of the band. etc, etc\n\nBottom line: my point is that rarely if ever do you have a version of a song where they nail EVERY aspect of the song where it is the 'BEST EVER.' Some parts/aspects are great, best ever material but other aspects are not.",
