This show is a classic for many reasons most notably Eyes and Playin', but the overall groove of this '74 gem is felt everywhere.  \nScarlet has a good Jerry jam, the Black-Throated really soars and Straw>China>Rider>Around closes out a really good 1st set.   \nA few songs into Set 2 it's Eyes of the World!  This particular version of Eyes is absolutely incredible.  If you are an Eyes of the World fan, you must download this version.  Jerry's interplay with Bobby and Phil is ridiculous and Keith busts out some nice chops himself.  This segues invisibly into a rippin' Big River.  Then they finsish Set 2 with a mind blowing Playing in the Band .  This is one of Keith's finest performances ever.  Notice him feeding off Jerry throughout on this epic version. .....but there's still Set 3!  \nThe 3rd set highlights include a wonderful Greatest, a power jam out of Truckin and a show stopping GDTRFB closer.  The Casey  Jones encore must only be described as an afterthought.",

And other than some minor sound glitches, a pristine recording.\n\nI most remember the moment that Round N Round modulates up in mid-solo - sent an electric surge through the crowd. Also remember the moment Eyes began to transition to River, Playin', Scarlet and Phil coming out to say, 'We're not going to play all night, but we are going to play all day ...' (or something like that) And they did, 12:30 to about 5:30.\n\nSitting up in the grandstand bar the night before, watching the crew assemble the wall of sound -I had no idea what was in store - \n\nDownload this - it's a three set gem.\n\nUnbelieveable to hear this 31 years later.",

I think this show has really been overlooked based on the other shows from '74 that get all the attention. From top to bottom, it is definately in the top 3 for me. We all know that Jerry was at his best this year, but Bobby, Phil and Keith really do some amazing stuff in this show, at least I notice it more in this recording that any other.

The band had these amazing tents set up behind the stage and any of the campers could go in there to partake of apparently amazing delicacies. I remember how much of the equipment in front of the Wall of Sound were illuminated with these little green lights on the meters and such that seemed to be producing energy in something other than the normal visual spectrum, much like the speakers transcended the customary aural range.\n\nThe banter right after Bertha is great: time is only a subjective experience. Scarlet Begonias is utterly amazing, Jack Straw is hot, China Cat/Rider is to die for, and this is only the first set! (Wait until you hear U.S. Blues.)\n\nAnd as others have commented Eyes is perfect and Band is great and so is everything else. The gleam is absolutely amazing; and so is it's pain. It's 100% pure Grateful Dead with very few taping errors.",

The band demonstrates a capability to compose on stage, and works through now well tested body of material, yet spins it out uniquely 74.

Not to mention the board and sound problems. The dead where Magical on many nights, but this night will not see heavy rotation in my player.",

The Eyes is underrated and is one of the best I have ever heard. Jazzy, upbeat, and clean. The transition into Big River is as good as it gets, it has to be heard to be believed. For that reason I prefer it over the Eyes > China Doll from 6-18-74, which I think is a better show overall, but not in every sense.",

The stage was set up in the center of the track with the \"wall\" pointed at the grandstands. Bill Graham was there. I got a great pic of him kneeling at the front of the stage. Phil had a beard, Jerry didn't. The crowd was very relaxed and friendly. Absolutely the best show I ever saw. What you can't hear on any tape is Phil moving the sound of his bass from side to side, up, down and around in the wall of sound during the long jams. It was piss-your-pants exciting.",

The jam at the end (into Big River) has two things I love that haven't been touched on, a beautiful Phil solo (sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't) & awesome, stunning drumming from Bill K. I had to actually check the date to make sure it was from the 'one-drummer' era, because he sounds like several people at some points. The fact that the drums are loud in the mix helped me notice that he is almost leading the band during this jam,dictating changes, even without a 'melody' instrument. Amazing rolls, over-the-bar fills, Billy is a JAZZ drummer folks (as well as a rock and country drummer), and he proves it here in spades.",

The spacey Playin' is one of my favs, especially the jam leading you down the rabbit hole, Phil takes you to DARK places.  Also check out the nobody's fault jam. Classic '74, strange tangents and interesting segues. They were so nimble this era, i think the single-drummer was freeing in this respect.",

What this sound places upon you will forever cement the grace and beauty of such music. This concert is very well played *duh!*. There is so much more... but not much to say. I am faltering on words because I so very recently began to awake to a sense of understanding the transcendental... thus these concerts leave fleeting imprints upon me that arrive with truth alongside each song. True beauty is played in each song. We are the song the mornign brings. We are one. We are beauty, and truth, and the sound harmonious with that. Let it ring in all ears! Let the Dead ring in all ears! Let them ring as we are- and ring as one with the most beautiful and passionate sound ever conceived by mortals! Divine beauty in the sound, poetic truth within the lyrics... something amazing here that moves fully in completely-achieved unison throughout 74. Keith plays a tremendous part. They all do. They all do as one. We all do as one. All beauty all life all synonymous all as one. All songs all grace. All of this! THe music... that's what its about on this website. That's the extent of my rambling... this is quite an amazing concert though, and alongside just about every concert, should be heard in chornological order with the rest of this month becuase they had arrived at such a wonderful place with the sound and setlists here",

      "review_text": "As Doug said, skip first several songs Bertha suffers from poor balance in the SBD, and poor playing. There are also cuts.\nMexicali, SQ is better here, and the energy is awesome. Jerry does some interesting trills with his guitar. He's basically rapidly throwing down double notes. The SQ then shits the bed again, and the drums and vox are all we get up front. Was this a Wall of Sound issue perhaps? Too many moving pieces theory?\nRow Jimmy has Keith on the organ. Can't hear Phil & Bob well, by the end of the song we seem to have gained full SQ. \nBIODTL\nScarlet Begonias has a nice mellow tempo. Donna flow moans during the jam. The outro jam that will one day go into FOTM is nice.\nBTW... ugh, Bob's voice is low in the mix. They just can't get it right! They do fix that before the song ends, and it ends off nicely.\nSugaree... ARGH! The sound drops out again. Then a cut.\nEl Paso, the piano needs tuning and Phil has a fit because the crowd won't be quiet so they can tune it. Ummmm. Anyhow, the song is fine, though Jerry misses a few points of noodle. I like Bob's distressed sounding singing.\nMust Have Been the Roses hits the spot, finally the SQ is good.\nJack Straw gets to some Jerry fanning. Keith is on the organ.\nChina>Rider, ah, finally to some official release SQ. First jam builds up energy nicely. By the 8 minute mark we get into X-Factor as it switches gears into Rider with force. The Rider is a bit less than I would like.\nAround x2 closes us out with force.\n\nUS Blues opens the 2nd with force.\nRace is On, one of the best renditions of this song out there.\nEyes>Big River\nEyes is super groovy, nice and long. The final jam before heading into the Mississippi is jazzy as it gets. In Big River Keith assumes the organ where he'd normally be on piano... not the best choice. Jerry and the rest of the gang make up the difference decently.\nPITB starts strong, with Keith taking some really strange tone... not even classical artists would have touched the harpsichord tone he takes. By the 4 minute mark we're already in a gorgeous jam. Melodic and exploratory right out of the gate. Phil putting down some strong bass helps. That strange harpsichord is now awesomely creepy. The song turns toward space for several minutes, but gains more energy around the 15 minute mark, with the Tiger tone being assumed. At 16 the Tiger does leap out of the bushes and tear your face off. Just after the 22 minute mark we hit a short lived but awesome jam, this gets recalibrated back to the PITB them and this will lengthily return us to the reprise. Pretty good PITB, though pre-Tiger it did start getting a little snoozy for me. The crazed Tiger made it worth it!\n\nTN Jed is back to the SBD source, sound issues are gone now. Keith should not use the organ on this one. Makes it sound like circus music. It does work well in the fantastic final jam!\nMAMU\nDeal is great, sans the circus tone keys. Jerry is on fire. Strong finish.\nGSET is raucus.\nShip of Fools features the Keith signature funeral home tone, perfect. Great stuff here.\nTruckin>Nobody's Jam>Wharf Rat>GDTRFB\nThe meat sequence starts with a juicy Truckin, the explosion is great. Keith's tone is somewhat psychedelic, still, but he kind of misplays it a bit during the explosion, as though he were still playing piano. After the explosion this heads right into Nobody's Fault But Mine Jam. Around the 9 minute mark we get an interesting jam, with the MLB theme clearly in there. Wharf Rat finds its roots coming out of that jam in a great way. A powerful Wharf Rat with an extremely climactic ending washes up on the sodden shores of Goin' Down the Road. I mean, the song actually sounds drunk during the intro. This is in large part due to Bob's rhythm playing. It builds up energy nicely as well, very bluesy Jerry throughout. This meat sequence will entertain you, unless you are deaf.\n\nEncore: Casey Jones = Fun times!\n\n______________________________________\n\nPerformance Summary\nThe first set... I can't get past the terrible sound issues that plague 1/2 the set. It was very frustrating, and not the band's fault. Once the SQ gets fixed, it's a pretty good set.\n\n\nSound Quality\nOfficial release = A+\nSBD starts off really rough. It doesn't get better until El Paso really, so maybe start the show there... definitely tune in to Phil freaking out before El Paso.",

Not a conventional keyboard sound at all...particularly if you are talking about Keith playing on this song. You can hear him on the organ but in playing you start to hear some beeps and squeals and otherworldly sounds coming from the keyboard. If it was not Ned then it sounds like Keith sat down at Ned's keyboard and made some strange sounds. Listen and let me know what you think. Either Ned without credit or Keith or \"somebody\" making Ned like sounds. Anybody have any color on this? Feedback?",
