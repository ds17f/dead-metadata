He then ran back to his Isuzu Trooper (Iron Maiden \\m/ (><) \\m/) and produced a tape of the second set of this show.  I still love listening to this tape.  It's a wonderful AUD and you really feel like you are there.\n\nScarlet is powerful and the clap along on Fire, as well as one of the solo's, is wonderful.  I'm happy for LL Rain, and I'm sure that LL Rain is happy that I'm happy for it.  Eyes is fast and has wonderful beat, and it flows into drumz nicely.  This is one of the only drums that I'll listen to. (OMG!! You don't listen to drumz every time!!!! it's ok, lay off the molley)\n\nPost drums has a Black Peter thats decent, but the best part for me is the Bobby Doubler.(Bob fans are people too)  Around > Good <3'n.  Bobby really gets yelpin during these two.  Definately worth a listen.",

Yes, 87 is oft-neglected for the brevity of the jams and the blase setlists (the 9-18-87 Dew excepted, of course), but the energy at these show (particularly these spring shows, which was Jerry's welcome back for the East Coast) was just awesome.  This is personally my favorite show of all time, despite the confusion engendered by a little too much Dupree's in the first set ;-).  I've turned many a non-Head on with the tape of the Set 2.\n\nThe Centrum is in such a hole, and of course my ride that evening was impounded, but what a night!  This very very nice AUD (much better than the FM AUD that I ran into the ground over the last 17 years--has it really been that long?!?) makes abundantly clear the level of the crowd energy, particularly in set 2, where it starts from the first strains of Scarlet and doesn't really let up.  It was just a wonderful first night of a wonderful run of shows.\n\nWas this the night Walton showed up on-stage?",

      "review_text": "A well-performed show that too rarely effortlessly catches fire. 1st Set: Brrrrr... \"Cold Rain\" resonates with spiteful feeling. \"Minglewood\" grooves, Mydland's active with his Hammond but we're still awaiting Jerry's guitar to shine its omnipotent light. \"Stagger\" nicely conveys the yearning for that 'sweet jelly roll' but musically, just standard. \"Far From Me\" is fine, a tad sloppy drunk, which actually helps. \"Uncle\"'s got a keen skiffle beat goin'...\"Mexicali\"'s a tad mellow and lazy for my tastes tho Jerry's guitar is nicely linear. \"Push\" continues the 'blahland' streak. Well, the middle slightly soars cause I'm imagining swaying with a pretty lass. \"BIODTL\" features nice tinkering Hart percussive work. \"Bird Song\" works well considering the delicate tone of the music so far, but those orinthological sounds are cheesy. The show fierily comes alive during the jammy mid-section. \"Music\" is decent but epitomized the slightly slagging energy that repped this set. \n\n2nd Set: \"Scarlet\" is a step in a positive direction. Again, it's professional playing; however, it's not exactly burnin the rubber off my shoes. However, \"Fire\" is exceptionally well played; it's not bristling with 'fire,' although it's quite fluid. \"LLR\" is fine, but it's \"Eyes\" that this show was thematically made for. It's well-played but a bit feathery and 'take it or leave it' for my tates. \"Drums\" passes without mention, @ 4:15 of \"Space\" it sounds eerily similiar to the segue music Smolin uses on \"The Music Never Stopped.\" (LA Radio Dead Show)\"Gimme\" opens like a beautiful dawning. The version's fine, segues right into the birth of \"The Wheel.\" Solid version, that strolls into good ol \"Black Peter.\" Standard version leads to a delightful \"Around\" punctuated by Brent's pokeyness. \"Good Lovin\" is a good-natured Bobby cheesefest. \nAn especially poignant, wizened (for some reason, it hit me) \"Black Muddy\" closes this opening night @ the Centurm.",

People always talk about '89, or the latter '70s, which were great as well, but I think people forget about these Springtime '87 gems. I saw all three of these Centrum shows, and they were smokin'. Not quite as good as the Spectrum shows right before these, but they were still amazing. The \"super\" highlights were Scarlet/Fire on night one, and Morning Dew on night three. But every song the played was a highlight at these shows really. The GSL/Wheel and the GL closer on night one were probably the best all-time versions of those tunes. The Bird Song/MNS was stellar on the same night were top-notch. The OMSN on night three shook the place so much I thought that POS venue was going to collapse. Up until '95 I was hoping to see the energy of the '87 Spring Tour return, but it never did.",

      "review_text": "My first show and my first review      I knew nothing about the Dead when I was brought to this show by a good friend, I was a senior in high school shy of my 18th birthday. The only songs I knew were Gimme Some Lovin' and Good Lovin', and thus began my lifelong love affair with this music. \n     Cold Rain could have been louder but this was the first night of three in Worcester. Worcester is nicknamed \"wormtown\" by the locals. I guess its because its a dirty city, I'm from Boston, for that reason I still get a kick out of Bobby singing \"its T right here in Worcester...\" Duprees (a rare one) was long and fun, by this point in the show all worries about Jerry's overall (post coma) health were gone. Brent threw in an exceptional Far From Me that was extremely well received by this enthusiastic crowd. Me and My Uncle>Mexicali came next, I particularly love Garcia's playing during Me and My Uncle. At this point the band was really feeling great, you can feel it in the music. Push Comes to Shove mellowed us out for a few minutes then BANG! BIODTL. Next was a really beautiful Bird Song, Jerry was having fun with the singing audience, with a deliberate pause before the first \"Snow and Rain.\" Song came complete with bird chirping sounds (really). Music Never Stopped, forget about it. the set was exceptional.\n     The Scarlet to open the second set seemed like the boys were being deliberately slow and methodical, smoke em if ya got em. Fire is the same way, kinda like putting on your favorite old pair of pajamas, comfortable and relaxing. Then came an upbeat L.L.Rain with Garcia whipping lighning bolts around, paced much quicker than most versions I remember, lyrically Weir sounds like a total pro. Then a quick and sweaty Eyes takes us to drums. I remember sitting down during drums, stoned out my mind. I did no drugs at this show, my contact high was that good. Besides at 17 I had no tolerance to speak of. I guess I was second-hand stoned.\n     I don't know how to review drums and space other than saying drum duet followed by the rest of the band making strange noises. (Smoke more if ya got more.)\n     Phil got lyrically involved with Gimme Lovin', if you listen closely you can tell he was really having a great time. Then came Wheel, which usually came before Gimme Lovin', but not on this night. I've never been a huge fan of audience tapes. I'm a soundboard guy, but I must admit I really like hearing the crowd singing along with The Wheel, everyone in the building is having a blast, great stuff. Break out the feety pajamas again for Black Peter. This song took on a new meaning for deadheads after Jerry's coma, (just wanna have a little peace to die, and a friend or two I love at hand)I was brand new to the scene and I felt it that night. The feeling was one of genuine concern and it was palpable. Nonetheless Black Peter is superbly perfomed by all members of the band. Seriously, give this one a listen, its really a killer version! Then its off with the PJs and throw on your dancing shoes, since Jerry took two in a row, Bobby ended with two show stoppers, Around and Around and Good Lovin'.\n    The boys had to be tired by then, So we got a Black Muddy Encore. I always loved that friggin' song, I must admit I was kinda heartbroken when they stopped playing it. All in all 21 songs, and another head with a sticker on my back bumper that  read, \"Who are the Grateful Dead and why do they keep following me?\" Later that year I went to California for New Years, it was the first time I mail ordered, as luck would have it, I got 'em. Thanks Rosie! I'm still lovin' and listenin', this show truly altered my existence.",
