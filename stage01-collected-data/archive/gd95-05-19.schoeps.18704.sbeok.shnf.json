We took a vacation to Las Vegas and knowing the Dead were gonna be there on the same given dates, I miraculously handed them their first tickets. They have never ever been to a Dead show in thier life and I felt it was indeed something to do for them.  \n My mother being a high class woman did leave her 2pt diamond braclet on  and being so sunny, wherever I roamed the UNLV stands, I knew where my parents were. They truly enjoyed the show mainly the encore. \nSo the way I look at this show:\n\n3 GD Tickets: $325\n3 NW Airfare: $350\nHotel: beats me, parents took care of that.\nCar Rental: $200\n3 bottle Water: $300\nThe Dead/Parents/Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds: PRICELESS!",

I thought the show on the 19th was the worst of the 3, with an absolute throw away 1st set. Even the lame 6 song set on the 20th was slightly redeemed by the Race is On. The 2nd set on the 19th had a couple highlights including Standing on the Moon, but is clearly surpassed on the following 2 nights. If you are looking to download a 95 Vegas show start with 05/21 and work your way backwards.\nWhile I certainly don't approve of the damaging of peoples personally property I can't help but laugh when I read that somebody keyed a Yugo in one of the reviews below. Heck they could of cut the door off with a Ginsu knife. Also a good way to avoid smelling like urine is to open your fly before peeing.",

I don't remember If we talked or what, but by the time we saw the strip, she was to be my new girlfriend.Had SO MUCH FUN taking over Las Vegas with my brothers and sisters, it felt like utopia. Walked into circus circus with 5 bucks and walked out with a bottle of Jack Daniels and 30 dollars for some other things. We slept in the parking garage around some other wayward travelers. The next day, Jay Leno walked right by us and said,\" They look like they're here for the Grateful Dead Shows,\" while we were loitering outside the Caesar's Palace. He was with his pals going to his limo, he was cool. He said hi and didn't make trouble for us. Didn't know he was that short though. The Shows were OK considering the HEAT and my new girlfriend dehydrating due to the mushrooms she ate on her pizza earlier. She must have forgot to drink!! We were dancing, then THUMP! fell over the row in front of us, luckily someone there to break her fall a little. Good AUD recording, the best i've heard on here.",
