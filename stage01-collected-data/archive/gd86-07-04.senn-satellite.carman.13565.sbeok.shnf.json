We literally pitched our tent in his front yard, (a smelly old 4 man Army tent from the 60's). \nWhile we were trying to get some shut eye it seems a gentleman that had parked his car right next to our tent had locked his keys in the truck of his sedan and thought it would be a good idea at about 2:00am in the morning to begin pounding holes in the back of his cruiser's quite solid truck with a hammer and chisel. He completed destroying his truck lid at about 4:45 or so. Needless to say, the guy must not have gotten any sleep! We weren't harsh on him. In hind sight, my thinking might have been flawed. :) kidding...\n\nAnyway, we were not going to get much sleep anyway and it certainly made for an interesting part of this story.\n\nBack to the homeowner... That morning he invited everyone to use his outside water hose to take a shower. I got naked and everything. I had not been in front of a naked mature woman that I didn't know who was also naked but not interested in anything but getting clean. Being a Dead Head has allowed me to shed some of my shyness. The gentleman whose name escapes me was very kind to all that he met and I saw his mood change from somewhat depressed about his situation to ecstatic about all the friends he made and directions to go from there. The show was great! Got really sunburned. Jerry wore a red T-Shirt what does it mean? It was video taped live satelite broadcasted. I turned a Dead Head hitch-hiker onto Yes with the long verion of America. :) \n\nJust a little background. \n\nHEY SPIKE WAT-A-YA LIKE!?",

I've watched the 2nd set on video and Jerry looks great throughout most of the show. Though it may have been, it doesn't look like his health is failing. Not even close compared to how he looked in '95.  He's having a great time during the Cold Rain>Fire 2nd set opener and looks fine through most of the set. \n\nAnd about the rain, the sky was a bit cloudy, but there didn't appear to be any rain during the 2nd set.\n\nSounds and to me like this is one of the best during summer of '86.",

St Helens and this song.",

Went home to Toronto that night feeling NO PAIN...Sound quality even @ the top of Rich Stadium was a little muffled but it otherwise a nice sounding show, unlike Dylan's show.",

Me and my buddy Ron got damp but not wet. A sprinkle would be the term.  I am so close to Jerry I could have spit on him, literally.  Despite the 4 doses it seems like yesterday.  A dude next to next to me at one point says they should play Cold Rain and they do. The drizzle stops and this guy looks at me and says a Fire would warm the crowd like nothing else could. Guess what, it happened. Then the dude says Sampson and Delilah will be next and nails it.\n  Don't care what others say about this show sound wise I gotta love it, turned a true friend onto the Dead this day and he has not looked back.",

      "review_text": "Not as bad as you might think Overall: Knowing that this was just a week or so before Jerry's coma, this show is not as bad as you'd think. The recording is not great (neither of the recordings currently on Archive are great), but it will certainly suffice if you want to hear a show you attended many moons ago. \n\nThe scene: I went to this show with Brian R, his older brother Chris, and Pat M., and maybe a few others. We then met up with a bunch of other kids from our high school in Pittsford NY once we were inside. This was my second show. Dylan/Petty opened and my memory is that it wasn't that memorable. Then again, I ate two sugar cubes. Weird vibe for the show. Saw a big fight break out on the floor. Then our friend Tim H got lost on the way in and by the time he found us, he was deep into a bad trip. Sun, then rain, then a pretty cool sunset and a nice summer night. \n\nThe music: not as bad as you'd think. Phil makes some strong appearances. Bobby and Brent also try to bring up the energy that Jerry is definitely lacking. Jerry flubs a lot of lyrics and his guitar playing is strong at times, but not so much at others. The front section of the second set was broadcast for Farm Aid (hence, Bobby's remark about this being a agrarian nation before Wheel). But overall, this is really only to be listened to for nostalgia's sake.",

The rain remembered by the Heads close to the stage was from firehoses used to keep us all hydrated. Thanks to the good folks from Buffalo for being prepared.

      "review_text": "Had To Be There This was my first Dead show ever, so it'll always be special for me. I was high as hell, too, so that and never having seen a show before made it impossible to judge. When I listen to it now, though, I'd have to say this is on the shortlist for the worst Dead show I personally attended. The band in generall, and Jerry in particular, are sluggish and tired-sounding. The Cold Rain and Fire in set two have some nice moments, but other than that, pretty listless and uninspired playing from the boys. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a crappy Dead show over many bands' best, but if you're thinking about streaming or downloading, I wouldn't recommend it unless you were there and want it for nostalgia's sake, because this show is a pretty weak example of 80's Dead.",

As Rich Stadium thumped Cold Rain->Fire, I felt the icy cool sweat beads collect on my sunburned shoulders and i danced with 60K strong in the July sun, Jerry's rapid, twangy lightning-spun riffs filling everyone up, quenching the thirsty masses. 18 yrs. old, declaring my own independence with every noodly gyration. What a time, what a time!!",

And if you had a good trip - that don't mean jack about the show. \n\nPeople , Jerry looked like death - and was darn near it. Check out the footage - not sure if it is YouTube or what. Farm Aid Broadcast.\n\n38 minute first set. I will never say I regret attending a GD show - but this one was pretty much off the charts ( not in a good way).\nYou could tell the band wanted to get the heck outta there. \n\nCold Rain>Fire on paper looks fabulous - but too bad Jer waited too long to try it. \n\nFor those who gave this five stars, I am assuming it was out of 10.\n\nSorry for the \"soapbox\" rant, but really knowing how ill Jerry was (even in hindsight) how could this show garnish more than a star (not Dark).\n\nGod Bless - apoplogies to those who are convinced this was a great show.",
