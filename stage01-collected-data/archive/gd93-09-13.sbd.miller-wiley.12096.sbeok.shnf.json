Yes, the Scarlet-Fire-Playin-Dark Star-Terrapin was not only some of the tightest playing the band offered during this time period, BUT, and this is a big BUT, Vince actually managed to give me the chills with his wordless ballad that he played coming out of terrapin-*its actually at the beginning of the Drumz file*-the band gets kind of quiet around him, and lets him go--its nothing too fancy, but nice, touching even. Vince makes a nice contribution here. Give it a listen.  Jerry and Bob chip in, too, toward the end before Drumz kicks in.  Wow did they LOVE to play the Spectrum. \n\nIts one thing to have a nice looking setlist its another when they actually deliver on one.  5 stars.",

The show is in the correct order if you are streaming it as I just did. The jam in scarlet sends chills down my spine. I liked the twangy sound of the \"lightning bolt\" in the fall 93 run. If my memory serves me, Jerry broke it out at the Autzen stadium run in august. The easy answers out of space really turned me off along with the IFTL encore. Other than that, this was one of the best shows of the fall run. Dark Star is very short. I remember some head in the lot with a large sign that counted the days/years and shows since the last Philly Dark Star in 1973.(which is also a good show) The first set is respectable and contains the first of three Dire Wolves of this tour. The Terrapin is very nice, but the one in Boston on the 29th has a better jam the goes off the hook.(That show shuold not be overlooked. The boys were like a swiss watch that night.)All in all, this is one of the better shows of the 90's. The set list is great and the playing holds up throughout. Definetly worth the DL. BTW, the spectrum is still there and is still known as the rectum. The worst place to meet your friends is still the rocky statue. Recently at a Jimmy Buffet show Rocky was wearing a grass skirt and a Lei.",

I remember seeing the same sign Jason recounts; regarding so many years, months, days, min.s since the last Philly Dark Star. I spent a very cold miserable night sleeping out for tickets (Kennett Sq.), and had missed the last tour altogether, so I was quite ready for this night. I sat way up in the nosebleed section behind the stage (Phil Zone). This gave me the rare opportunity to see the band \"warm up\". Through a black cloth draped over the stage, I saw a glowing cherry go around n' round, making six stops along the way. I have a freind who claims to have met Jerry that night.\nThe music speaks for itself so I don't feel it necessary to comment much on the setlist. I do, however, dispute that the 1st set was bland. This was my first (long awaited) show so I was enthralled. The second set changed my entire existence! It was almost a week later when I finally landed. Our seats pretty well sucked both for veiw and acoustics, but looking back, I wouldn't have been anywhere else on the planet that night.",

Jerry's guitar almost sounds acoustic for much of this show (other shows in '93 too) and there's a very nice delicacy to it in that every note is clear. Nice midi work on space or jam and a good drums. Everybody seems to be dialed in for this show tho Phil could be a bit louder for my tastes. Good Terrapin and Playing as well and a surprise Dark Star that is short but sweet. I even liked Easy Answers and Days Between and I know I'm probably in the minority in that opinion at least among my Deadhead friends. Weirdly though the set seems out of sequence: jam should happen before drums I believe? In any case a very nice show from late in the game. I haven't heard that many shows from '93 and I have to say I'm finding some really good ones such as Boston Garden from 9/24. Time tripping on the Archive is a hell of a lot of fun.",

As a look at the setlist would seem to indicate, it is the second set that will blow your mind. Short-but-sweet renditions of some of the band's most classic songs and then a Terrapin for the ages... followed by some of the more decent \"new\" songs (just to remind you that this isn't from March 1990 or anything, in case you forgot) after a rousing Drums/Space. What more could you want from a 1993 show? I'm not all that fammiliar with Vince-era stuff, mostly because the setlists and actual playing were much better in previous eras, but this just might be one of the best shows in my collection. \n\nDefinately recommended, just for the amazing second set. This general time period has a lot of amazing-looking setlists that simply aren't matched by the actual playing, but here, the band definately steps up to the plate. I would be very happy if this were officially released.",

I'd loved the dead's music for years before this (thanks to the good tastes of my older brother), but of course the show blew my mind. What an experience - in the lot, a friend and i stopped to down a few brews. Our other friends went in, not wanting to wait. Unfortunately, the guy i was with's wallet, with ticket inside, was in one of the OTHER friends pocket. BUMMER! After a long and fruitless search in the lot, shouting our bro's name, we gave up. I gave him almost all my cash ($4!) so he could catch the train home. I distinctly remember a guy dressed as the grim reaper, with a sign saying \"There hasn't been a Dark Star in Philly in 21 years\". I went inside, having missed a few tunes, and things have never been the same... A tribe of dreddies sitting in front of me got me stoned to the gills, adding to the powerful contact high of the whole scene. The show was incredible. Etched in my mind forever. All my favorite tunes, and dark star to boot. Afterwards, not knowing where to find my ride home, I went up to a nitrous tank  with my last dollar, and was given the biggest balloon i've ever seen. On my last gasp of gas, I turned my head to see my friends climbing into the car in the distance. serendipity, but i was sad to have to leave...I felt like running away from home. 15 years later, I'm looking forward to the Spectrum shows on 5/1, 5/2. Hopefully, i'll feel like a 14 year old again!",

Check the lineage - it's still from Charlie...\n\nTwo comments: Listened to this show because of the reviews, especially about the second set; but the first set is RED HOT too.  Whenever Jerry pulled out the \"Lightning Bolt\" guitar and deliberately planned to play semi-acoustic - stand by for music!\n\nSecond, the big problem with Easy Answers is that it uses the same chord progressing on the chorus as VOTC, and the Band tends to slip into the same riffs...  Yes, it's a problem.  OTOH, I really like Easy Answers, and on this recording you can tell that Bobby likes it too.\n\nBoth Jerry and Bobby were in rare form, both vocally and instrumentally.  From the first song it was clear that this was going to be a concert to remember.  Wish I had been able to be there...\n\nSpeaking of wishes, I wish there was a good MTX of this show - the audience was in rare form - and I'm pretty sure I know why, considering the date... ;)",

      "review_text": "For late 1993...... I hate starting off with \"For 1993....\".  Or \"For a 95 show....\". But after listening to this one on Sirius today, the only way to sell myself on the show is to say that \"For a 1993 show, they boys were on....\".    Kills me to say this, but by the end of 1993, a good show for Jerry was a mere shadow of his former self.   Yes, he stepped it up on Fire On the Mountain.  And Dark Star, even if short and a bit laid back rather than searing with intensity, is a treat.   But between the \"thin, twangy, almost acoustic\" sound he was generating with the MIDI, and the jams stopping a step or two below where they went in the 70's and early 80's, I cannot call this one for the ages.   Rather, a very good show for the time.  Which means a country mile better than any other band out there at the time.    And a band I tried to catch whenever humanly possible in the hope of catching a glimpse of their former magic.  The magic that was there more often than not during the early years of my \"voyages\" to see the band [started in '74].\n\nAnyway, I'm calling this a three star show.   Take away the Easy Answers and I might go 3&1/2.   Played well.   Other than Dark Star, a very familiar song selection.  Just doesn't have the intensity and \"thick sound\" to go higher than three when rating as a show in a vacuum rather than a show performed in late 1993.\n\nLooking forward to Dead & Company next week.  Will never be the same, but grateful we can keep going furthur :-)",
