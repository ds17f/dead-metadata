O.k., where to start with this one...\n\nA SMOKING show throughout:\n \nA long show with 30+ tunes/jams, it includes one of only three performances of Money Money.  Most of the performances are absolutely terrific, especially China>Rider, Greatest Story Ever Told (check out the jam in the middle), and the disc #3 jams into GTRFB.  Donna's wailing is hysterical (literally) on Scarlet and GSET.  And Bobby tries to outdo her on One More Saturday Night.  You'll be smiling throughout...\n\nOverall sound is great, and the only major negative is the drop-out of the vocals from mid-Sugaree through El Paso.  If you don't mind a bit of GD karaoke, then ignore it and sing along.\n\nDon't hesitate to add this one to your collection! \n\nAnd yes, Donna's a bit overbaked at times, but it just adds to the overall fun; how could you not be laughing along with the band and audience when she lets it all hang out... :)",

      "review_text": "great jams I'm not the biggest '74 fan, but I really like this show.  First off though, when I say this show, I really mean set 2.  Maybe it's just me, but the vocals seem too low in the mix for about half the 1st set (starting in the middle of Sugaree I think).  The rest of the mix is pretty good, but I have a hard time with the 1st set because I couldn't really hear the vocals.  Other than the excellent China > Rider though, set 1 doesn't really compare to set 2 anyway, which is where the real magic of this show is.\nThe band sounds great here, though like I said, I really prefer the 2nd set.  Great set, not a single botched song.  The Truckin/Mind Left Body jam is awesome, not to be missed.  Also a set 2 Peggy-O strikes me as pretty rare, that song is almost always set 1, and really shines in its contrast to such a rousing version of Truckin.  For the most part I think the band is playing very well--no sleeping at the keys from Keith in this one, though Donna does sound a bit rough at times.  Oh and I think this period is one of the best for Bobby's guitar playing, especially the intricate riffs he plays while Jerry sings his lead vocals.  Bobby seems overall very on-top-of-things in this show, doing a good Weather Report Suite too.\nBottom line, this is a very enjoyable show and the only reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5 are because the vocals were low in set 1, and also because there are some real \"warmup set\" moments in set 1.  If you want to know what '74 Dead is about though, check out China Cat through the end of the show and you won't be disappointed.",

You owe it to yourself to listen to it, it's so \"amazing.\" Makes you wonder what the other musicians were thinking.\n\nSecond set is fantastic (Donna actually sounds good on WRS), but first set ain't bad, with some choice moments -- Tennesee Jed bounces. Unfortunately, the vocals almost drop out midway through Sugaree and for several songs. The vocal audio returns with a tight Loose Lucy, another first set highlight, but goes into Money Money, not one of Bob's best compositions, \"enhanced\" by Donna. \n\nThe gig gets a 4 because of the mixed first set.

This is the most melancholy Wharfrat I've ever heard. Jerr's voice floats like wind during hte verses, and he lets loose the best solo at the end of any version I've heard. W-Report - simply beautiful. They actually pull off the vocal harmonization for a change (Incl. Donna). This version of Peggy~O~ still gives me goose-bumps 15 years after I first heard it.\n\nThis show has a very warm, cozy feel to it. It could easily serve as a soundtrack to all the damp, gray days of my life. My hissy, over-trebled, no-vocals tape gets a 5+. This Dl sounds great, so it gets a 7!",

But we ALL hear something different, don't we?\nNow, can we put the Donna bashing to rest?   Let's put her caterwalling in perspective.   NOBODY can honestly say the Bob Weir's \"singing\" is in ANY way better or worse than Donna's.   Are any of you listening to Bob at the end of Not Fade Away, OMSN, Sunshine Daydream, or many other songs where he's screaming unintelligibly?   NOT FADE AWAAAAAY!!!   Listen to Tomorrow Is Forever on the GD Movie Soundtrack & tell me she can't sing.   Every band member had off nights in their performances, where their voice or instrument/playing was not what it could be.   Yes, (BLASPHEMY) even Jerry fucked things up---nodding off on stage leaves you open to flubbed lyrics or sub-par playing, especially in the later years.\nAnyway, I have NOTHING BUT LOVE for ALL of the Grateful Dead members, regardless of their short-comings.   Sometimes they were ON, and other times they were OFF.   Donna added something important to the band, and I can't imagine her NOT being part of one of, if not THE GREATEST musical groups of ALL TIME!!!   Yep, she was off key more often than we'd like, but we're talking about mere seconds of chalk board scraping along with hours of MAGIC. \nI'd love to be the last person to weigh in on Donna's contribution, but I'm sure I won't be.

And second, as all die hard Donna lovers would agree, her contributions to the band weren't always in key harmonies or background vocals. But her solos and phrasing were quite good and very beautiful most of the time. Now as for the screeching, it's an acquired taste. Remember no Donna = no Keith.

      "review_text": "So funny... Having finally completed a nearly 10-year exploration of the GD archives, I've at last settled on my favorite year (for now ;) -- mainly because of Keith's absolutely brilliant, jazzy, funky keys throughout '74, and how sparkling Jerry's playing is, how inspired he is. \n\nI've also often plugged my ears listening to Donna's caterwauling on this site, so given the amount of abuse heaped on her in the comments here I hesitated to listen to this one at first...but this is one of her better efforts! I love the scream in Scarlet, and she's spot-on in BIODTL, which I honestly think is one of the nicest things I've ever heard from her so far.\n\nLook, fact is--without bashing her--monitors or not, Donna had intonation issues. She doesn't just miss notes but can't hold onto them when she does get on-key. Bob and Jer could flub tons of notes (and how come they could hear themselves if she couldn't?) but they don't have the same intonation problem she does--but ironically I think Donna is really FINE in this performance overall, and I'm generally pretty harsh on her. \n\nI'm giving this 5 for performance but 3 for recording--and yes, I know the music's the thing but having been spoiled by so many brilliant Matrixes and AUDs and whatnot, I really find the SBD problems are so significant that they inhibit my ability to properly rate this obviously incredible show--so I'm settling on 4 stars...which I'll probably regret, but there it is.",

In fact, I'd highly recommend you give a listen to all three shows from this beautiful, high energy Pacific Northwest run (P.N.E. 1974-05-17, U of Washington 1974-05-21).\n\nI'm about to sit down and compile my very own multi disc set combining my favorite tunes from this run.\n\nQuick question for all of you Heads, does anyone know why they played the shows in such a strange order? I mean, they went to Vancouver first, then Portland, then Seattle. Seems strange to me that they didn't just tour each city in the order they came (Vancouver, Seattle, Portland or Portland, Seattle, Vancouver).\n\nAnyone know what the deal was?",

      "review_text": "best jam ever In the early or mid nineties I had a partial recording of the second set of this show. I taped the show over the radio from a college radio program based at Hofstra University. This program was called the Dead Zone. It was on every tuesday from eight to ten. At the beginning of each show they would take the time to inform you of what length of tape to use and where the apropriate time to flip the tape was.The jam after Truckin was what they would use for background music. I would get goosepimples just from hearing that little tidbit. When they got around to playing the whole set it was even better than I imagined. As the bluesy jam after Truckin winds down you can hear Phil and Billy try to begin the faster paced jam that follows but Jerry is not quite ready.IMO this jam is something that they must have touched upon during a rehearsal or soundcheck or perhaps another show. Im curious to know if anyone has heard a similar theme during previous jams. I think this all to brief jam that precedes MLB jam is the greatest couple of minutes of music I have ever heard. I would give it twenty stars if possible.P.S. the rest of the show is no slouch either even with Donna's screeching. Top 3 of 1974",
