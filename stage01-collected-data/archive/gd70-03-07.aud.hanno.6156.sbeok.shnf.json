Thing of it is, that for most of 1970 the dead were forging forward full speed ahead and playing with unbelievable ferocity everynight. This show is a good example of that. The Lovelight is big. 1970 was the best year for lovelight, hands down. And to the 3/9 poster, if you think GDP has money lying around, I have an invitation for you. It's a one week pass, to take your head out of your a** and learn a thing or two about why they did this. Did you hear Ramrod died yesterday? Did you know they had to fire him a few months back b/c they were out of money? Didn't think so. \nSound - 5.75/10\nPlaying - 9/10\nShow - 7.5/10",

I really can't say enough about how heavy this all gets... you get dropped right in the middle of an absolutely BLISTERING \"not fade away\", jerry and phil combining into one vicious, jamming,  freaked-out freakatoid. mickey and billy stomp into \"drums\" like a zulu tribe drunk on wild boar's blood... mr. lesh machine-guns' the intro into \"good lovin'\", and you can tell the crowd is fucking ELECTRIC... this is real shit. well, our favorite band is time-travelling by this point & they slam warp-speed into \"the other one\"... garcia's lines are mind-numbingly fast and pissed off sounding... just fucking crazy!... back into \"not fade away\" once more just because it HAS to happen this way (pre-ordained or something...), galloping like the 5 ton wild horse that they are, and then.... one of theee most ball-shredding \"lovelight\"'s that these ears have ever had the pleasure of hearing (keep in mind folks, i'm still listening to an AUD!!!(shocking but true...)... pigpen delivers like a MAN on this night, and the rest of the guys are playing like f'in studs.... a classic ending to what should be a classic show... take some time and enjoy this one. you deserve it.\n\nshow - five stars (easily...)\nsound - 3.5 stars (not the best, but not even close to \"unbearable\" or \"unlistenable\")",

That said, you CAN get there from here but it may take more than a bottle of budweiser.  Some of the audience reactions themselves have merit.  In particular, there is a moment after the first verse of The Other One where the band hits a peak (the ascent starts around 3:55 into the track) and Garcia, at the plateau, riffs out this howling note that a dude in the audience emulates more or less exactly, invoking similar reactions among his \"friends\" nearby.\n\nClassic.\n\nDeadheads were and always will be freaks of the highest order.",

The openning act was Cold Blood with Lydia Pense and the blues that she belted out set the stage nicely for The Dead. By the time The Grateful Dead had come on stage I was well on my way to electric psychedelia as we had eaten our LSD on the way to the concert. I remember Garcia playing on the left side of the stage and when he sang Black Peter, the emotion and passion was incredible. I remember Bobby had some trouble with his monitor and ended up putting his boot through the speaker and then they brought out a new one for him.

      "review_text": "Les Dudek, Lydia Pense, and Stratocasters Well Heck, I was 15 and it was my first Dead Concert too. Jaarthur deserves credit for mentioning Lydia Pense & Cold Blood.  They impressed me & although I could not find any documentation about this, I remember Ms. Pense introducing Les Dudek playing lead using a black Les Paul.  He's one of the almost greats who never took off.  Since I cannot find him listed on her album credits, I think he must have been sitting in for her regular lead player.  If anybody else remembers Les Dudek being there, I would like to know for sure.  A few years ago, I was able to talk to Ms. Pense in Ukiah at the City's Summer in the Park concerts--which I highly recommend.  She said this show really helped put her on the map. I distinctly remember Casey Jones and Truckin being played.  It's not on this tape, but I checked other set lists and Casey Jones is on previous and subsequent sets, but not Truckin until much later.  I think it is possible that Casey Jones got left off this recording.  Maybe I remember another Working Man's Dead song instead of American Beauty's Truckin.  Also, I remember Garcia playing a standard Strat which was very similar to a '64 Strat that I had just bought.  I think I am correct because I felt very lucky to be 15 and being able to score this Stratocaster, so I was paying close attention.  I checked the history of his guitars and I think I am correct because what I read was that he received a Strat as a gift from Graham Nash.  That Strat evolved over time into his Alligator guitar.  Another possibility is the strat I saw was the same strat that Garcia uses in the Veneta, Oregon video.  I still have my Stratocaster--although it has a lot of history--I don't think it matches up to Garcia's.  Last, I had just started smoking weed and I thought I was very cool.  That was until I looked around the crowd and noticed some very spacey folks around me.",

Would I use this show to introduce or summarize the Grateful Dead to a new listener like you might with Veneta \u201872 or Cornell \u201877? Probably not, but for conditioned fans with well-trained ears, Santa Monica \u201870 offers a headspace that the afore-mentioned shows simply can\u2019t provide.\n\nThere are different schools of thought when it comes to audience tapes, and when it comes to ones like this, there are as many opinions as there are deadheads who\u2019ve listened to the show. From a general standpoint, you\u2019ll find old school cats who love, and sometimes even prefer AUDs, whether because of a lack of SBD alternatives for a specific performance/era (especially \u201867-\u201970 and \u201880-\u201983) or a soft spot for the tapers and their signature put-you-right-in-the-room effect. These folks swear by Jim Wise and the Oade brothers of early 80\u2019s fame, as well as Keith Litzenberger\u2019s admirable work from the 90\u2019s. You\u2019ve also got soundboard snobs who seldom stray from the incredible purity of what Bear, Bob Matthews, and Betty Cantor-Jackson captured in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, preferring the professional touch of official releases over anything snagged from the taper\u2019s section.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a little snobby in that if one is available, I usually go with soundboards for anything from \u201865-\u201995. Still, with AUDs, there\u2019s a clear correlation between my willingness to listen and how early in the band\u2019s career the show in question occurred. 9/15/67, 5/18/68, and 10/24/69 are damn well in my collection. Going in the forward-facing chronological direction from \u201895, with the right sound and lineup I also greatly enjoy AUDs from the post-Garcia projects as well. Modernized equipment and more experience under the tapers\u2019 belts have made for some excellent captures. I\u2019ll probably pass on a tinny \u201897 RatDog tape, but a rich, fat AUD of Derek Trucks sitting in with the Phil Lesh Quintet at Virginia Beach in August 2001? Sign me the fuck up.\n\nAudience tapes from 1970 are nothing short of an absolute blessing.\n\nBear\u2019s arrest and brief absence from the scene in 1970 meant that we don\u2019t have SBD recordings of a lot of the shows from that year, and in some cases, no recordings at all. To that end, in my book the fact that this is the only recording of 3/7/70 (or is it 3/9/70, as one attendee insists on dead.net?) means that it shouldn\u2019t automatically lose a star just for being an AUD, especially considering that it\u2019s a very serviceable one. Sure, there\u2019s some hiss, intermittent crowd chatter, splicing, a couple pops, and a cut or two, but each of the instrumentalists stand out, and although muddy, it\u2019s very enjoyable. 11/22/68 is a challenge, but this one is more like 4/24/70 or 8/18/70.\n\nPerformance-wise, it\u2019s cracking.\n\nAn attendee has mentioned that they opened with Hard to Handle, which is apparently missing. Multiple accounts suggest that there was a decent amount of LSD at play in the audience. I like what a previous reviewer pointed out about the Workingman\u2019s Dead songs - these numbers were still brand new at the time, and the crowd is dead silent during that howling Black Peter guitar solo. Any SoCal tripsters who couldn\u2019t make the Thelma Theater run a few months prior had probably never heard anything like this before. The China > Rider > High Time is equally impressive, with some burning guitar work from Bob Weir lighting up the road to Rider. High Time is one of those Garcia songs that\u2019s difficult to pull off, but beautiful when properly performed. Tunes like Bertha, Friend of the Devil, or Eyes of the World are tough to find a bad version of, just because of their fairly simple and straightforward pace, melodies, and improv-friendly chords. But slow ballads with a lot of vocal range like China Doll, and especially High Time, can be hit or miss, because Jerry and everyone else on stage would have to be locked in, in tune, and committed to the delicacy of the music, intricate crescendos and decrescendos, and poignant lyrics. As with many of the early versions, this High Time is perfectly captivating. The late \u201869/early \u201870 takes on backwoodsy Workingman\u2019s Dead material and twangy covers always seem to hit the mark, which is why it\u2019s such a shame we have just a brief snippet of what must\u2019ve been a great Dire Wolf.\n\nBlack Peter, China > Rider > High Time, and Dire Wolf // make up one distinct section of the show, and the // NFA > Drums > Good Lovin\u2019 > The Other One > NFA > Lovelight // sequence makes up the other. That first NFA jam really zips along and definitely hints at something like The Other One, Caution, or a similar vehicle. The way they step into each song of the sequence is incredibly natural and seamless. In every case, the next song\u2019s notes are plucked out of thin air; it\u2019s Phil who punches right through the wall between a rattling Drums and a booming Good Lovin\u2019, and Jerry who rolls Good Lovin\u2019 into a combustible The Other One, without any hesitation (or Cryptical Envelopment). Then it\u2019s back into NFA, and from that into Lovelight. You might not get any organ solos out of Pig in this show, but his vocal showmanship is as apparent as ever. The Lovelight is strong, with plenty of stops, starts, and showboating from McKernan. The tape cuts out at 24+ minutes in - they were still going!\n\nTaped by deadheads for deadheads. Fans of this era who don\u2019t mind cuts and claps will find this blue-collar recording very enjoyable. It\u2019s not a crystal clear Betty Board, but perhaps that\u2019s what makes it special. Very much worth at least a listen, and maybe even its own spot in the stash for when you need a brief 1970 recording that has some real attitude.",
