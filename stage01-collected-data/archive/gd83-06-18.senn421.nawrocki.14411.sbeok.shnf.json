Wasn't too sure about this show, but I'm trying to collect as many shows as possible by the Grateful Dead (for personal use, not to sell) - needless to say it's been taking me forever. But awesome show, really - they do an awesome Althea, one of my favorite songs by them and this is hands down the best I've ever heard of it. Jack Straw, well - I've definitely heard better versions, the vocals are somewhat drowned out by the audience in the beginning, then it takes a faster pace which I did not like. Jack Straw is supposed to be a more slow paced song. Anyways, still an all around excellent show so that's why I gave it 5 stars.\n\nOh, and an excellent version of Fire on the Mountain!\n\nEDIT: Someone said something about this version of Morning Dew being the best they've ever heard - agreed, another reason this show gets five stars.",

While these recordings may not be the best sound quality, the show definitely qualifies as one of the best every played, no doubt. I was at this show and got the tape soon afterwards, these uploads sound pretty much like the tape I got back in 86 - good audience. This show has always been one of my favorites. I have to agree with all of the comments about the Scarlet > Fire, this version could be the best ever.  I recall that during Fire On The Mountain a brief storm rolled overhead and we were treated to a little rain and some very timely lightening.  It was as if the boys were calling Fire from the sky that night. Then the Morning Dew with Phil's bass just blew everything away.  I seem to recall the encore as starting with Touch of Grey, a three song encore but I could be wrong.  This show is worth the download for the energy and quality of the playing, don't miss it.",

I remember a Saratoga that was 2 days, I see only one here, I definitely remember a decent DEW (always seeking the DEW), but most of all I remember some gawd awful pooring ass rain that turned the entire place into a mud bowl and the whole crowd into a soggy hotdog bun covered with mustard. Or at least that's what I thought happened. I blame the guy who said he brought tons of blotter because it seemed that the whole place was way more tripped out than usual. And funny someone mentioned radioactive whippets, too, because my other memory of that place was going into a local grocery store downtown and seeing someone rolling in the dairy aisle giggling with about 2 dozen spent cannisters of whip cream rolling around with him. so i haven't listened yet, but I'm about to, definitely cannot bestow a rating on an experience that so far all I remember is a crowd of soggy hot dog buns. police seem to come to mind, too, but I might be mixing that up with the carrier dome, which I'm going to hunt fir next to see if I can straighten out my upstte NY memories. If anyone remembers pouring rain and 2 days, help me out, because I was there grossing out wooried about you growing mold.\n\nok well now it won't let me post without rating, therefore I will give it a four. Since I can't remember it as clear as other East Coast shows, like Ithaca, Lewiston ME, spectrum 4/82 (greatest shakedown ever, and a blessed DEw) and the radioactive music hall was fun.\n\nand oh yeah since I'm actually posting and I'll probably not get around to it again like forever, I wonder about the existance for public consumption of JGB performances. The particular ones that comes to mind from that era (I was in school in Boston at the time) are Ocean State PAC in Providence and the Orpheum. No I don't remember dates, but I remember it was John Kahn and Merle Saunders and Jerry and the girls. I remember cold weather too. And ok, speaking of John Kahn, how about Old and in the Way? These are the questions that I wonder about, any help would be preesciated.\n\nDoes anyone know a guy named Father Bones?",

Sound is average, but far better than the swirly Nakamichi-bred copy I've had for some 24 years.\n\nHigh points:  Nice boppy first set, Good Bertha and Jack Straw.  Scarlet/Fire has some reallynice moments, and Playin' is a nice ethereal jam.\n\nOK, Dew.  Phil can be heard crumbling the pyrimids of Giza with his double and triple-stop bombs that are falling all over the place.  Being about halfway up the grass bowl outside, these notes are still vibrating inside me.  Damn!!!\n\nAfter the mellow bit, when the boys come back up to intensity for the finale, there is a collective \"scrubbing groundswell\" never before or since heard by these ears (except on tape, of course).  Imagine tens of thousands of screaming nuts being simultaneously transported to another planet by five mortal beings.  The ovation at the end of Dew is also just a beauty to behold.\n\nMy favorite GD moment, and one I'll carry with me forever.

      "review_text": "A good time was had by all..... For the most part a very good show...   Bertha was great.  Jack Straw a bit loose but still hot... Good Deal to end the set....  Still one of my favorite Scarlets- -Jerry just keeps taking the lead to the next level.   Always nice to hear the Dew, but there are many, many better.  Obviously Cornell 77 comes to mind, but so does Hartford 3/27/87....   Always preferred the 83 Touch of Grey's to the later years....   Crowd was great.....  Lightning during 2nd set was perfect considering the song selection [Wheel].  Got lost finding the car after the show.  Fortunately we figured it out and found our way back to the campground!!!\n\nIn any event, this is one of many shows that sounds as good years after the fact as it did that night.....  So it stays in my top 15 for combination of musical quality and enjoyment with friends along for the trip....",

The suspenders were killing us at that point :)). But then we stepped through the gate, and it was like being told you could breath again after holding it for for a year.\n\nShortly afterward, as we made our way between the trees towards the PAC, a dwarf with a bota ran up to us, crying \"Drink! Drink!\". So we did :)))\n\nThe PAC was completely alive. I have never seen that kind of energy in anything before or after. It was like a 47,000 headed thing had just danced into the room. At first I went up on the balcony, but after a while I went down front to check things out, and.. it was close :))))\n\nI got completely lost on the way out, but somehow found my way back to the bus, where everybody else had just returned, minutes before. We slept there in the lot, and left the next morning along with a bunch of other sleepy stragglers.\n\nOh, the show? It was freakin' amazin' :)))))",

The grounds were amazing, I ended up dancing in front of a colonial mansion.  The first set is beautifully played, a musical adventure.  The second set is where it really began to gel for me.  Right off the bat smokin', red-hot, like the song says, dancing hot and wild, heat lightning in the air, the Wheel, Playin', then just when you couldn't take it no more, the Dew, with, I swear, a cooling mist that started AFTER the song started (and the band was under a pavillion, and had no real way of knowing what the weather was like at that moment. I swear it was like they were controlling the weather) the epic Dew that wrenched the heart out of you and threw it on the ground...picking it up again, and sending us off another Saturday night...to play in the beautiful wooded grounds where heads laughed, and ran and played for hours on the trails in the woods and by the brookside; where every one loved each other in the magical woods that night, and you could hear snatches of laughter and happy people all around, agreeing that this was the best ever, and it was, and we knew it, and knew how blessed we were to be there that night with no one to chase us away and to be able to play in the dark with the magical fairy children who were us.  We Love You, comes the call through the dark woods, with giggles.  You had to be there.",

      "review_text": "Everything you wanted The other reiewers do a great job talking about this truly wonderful show. This was easily the highlight of the tour...the boys clearly wanted something special; the sound system included second time-synched stacks for those sitting on the grass. While this setup is normal practice now, the boys went all out for this show. It sounded good no matter where you were.\n\nWe arrived early morning after driving all night and the town was already grooving with heads doing their morning routine. By noon I swear the whole town was dosed.The circus had arrive, the train had pulled in, the inmates were in charge of the asylum. \n\nThis isn't the usual reviewer hyperbole \u2014 i've been to a lot of pre-coma shows and this one was special. Some guy took off all his clothes, climbed the pavilion wall and fell off; heads running through woods; big bad police chasing skinny road rats. And lots and lots and lots of blotter, pyramids, lots of everything, everywhere. Damn, it was fun.\n\nEveryone justifiably raves about Scarlet Fire & Wheel & Morning Dew. Somebody else said it \u2014 they called the weather. The Gods provided a light show.\n\nIt was a long show. My favorites: Althea, Scarlet Fire, Wheel, Morning Dew. \n\nMan I miss those days.",

Don't really remember much of the 1st set, when I was really getting off. Quintessential 80s Dead. I can't believe people are really criticizing and picking this show apart. I don't understand how one can be a Deadhead and not like this show. This was it! They were THERE and so were we. At SPAC!",

I spent the day hanging out in the stream with gorgeous girls who I'll never forget.\n\nIt was the quintessential GD show.  Beautiful day, nice people, many minds altered.\n\nIt's more than 40 years ago, but I remember it...wait I can barely remember the details but the impression it left on me was unforgettable...\n\nIt wasn't perfect performed.  But at the same time it was perfect in every way.  What a great weekend.",
