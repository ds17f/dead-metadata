I remember the walk into the fairgrounds being something like the descent into the pit of despair, with all the trash and dust. I remember a huge freak security dude call me a maggot and try to chase me for peeing on the ground. He wrecked my buzz, but it was funny how easily I smoked the dude. Don't bother.

      "review_text": "Thank You, Captain Trips, For A Real Good Time. THE BACKGROUND: Here in Vermont where I live, the 2 Highgate shows are legends in their own time.  There are many old hippies living in these hills, and many of the youngsters saw their 1st show up in that far, otherwise sleepy corner of our beautiful state. I have wanted to hear this show for 9 1/2 years as it was my last.  I drove 6 hrs from Bangor, Maine, where it was 60 degrees and pouring, across the White Mountains of Maine & New Hampshire where it stopped raining and the sky brightened, up I-91 and across northernmost Vermont in order to approach Highgate from the East.  By doing so, I avoided the 30 mile traffic jam on I-89 north of Burlington.  State Highway 58 across northern Vermont turns to dirt for about 15 miles and there is a box spring where the Long Trail crosses!  So, I filled up on sweet VT mountain spring water, continued on my way and passed a sign post reading < EDEN  9 MILES/HIGHGATE 21> !  While I wanted to see what Eden was all about, I was running to the minute to get to the show, so I continued.  Sure enough and in classic Grateful Dead style, in the upper Lake Champlain Basin the sun was shining bright and it was about 82 degrees.  The traffic jam approaching Highgate from the east side was only 5 miles long, so after paying $10 to park my car on someone\u00c3\u00c2s lawn and another $5 for a pickup truck ride to a trail head 3 miles from the stage, I was on my way.  I hadn\u00c3\u00c2t eaten in 6 hrs and, sure enough, the first food I encountered was some goopy hash brownies.  Who needs acid with an empty stomach when eating these?  By the time I arrived at the front gate, it had come down and the folks working it informed me \u00c3\u00c2the concert is now free.\u00c3\u00c2  !! The walk out afterward was epic, replete with powerful ganja gooballs, sunrise, a hitched ride from a local farmer and a drive through Smuggler\u00c3\u00c2s Notch on my way to stay with friends in Montpelier.  I did make it to Eden later that summer and live about 1.5 hrs south of the old airport where the stage was.\n\nTHE SHOW:  At the time, I felt the show was great, especially since several songs were first timers for me. Afterward, folks kept insisting it was totally awful.  Listening to it now brings out a lot of emotions about my relationship with the scene.  I still don\u00c3\u00c2t think it\u00c3\u00c2s all that bad.  Things get off to an inauspicious start as Jerry is barely audible during \u00c3\u00c2Touch Of Grey.\u00c3\u00c2  \u00c3\u00c2Wang Dang Doodle\u00c3\u00c2 is solid though, and \u00c3\u00c2Peggy O\u00c3\u00c2 not too bad either. \u00c3\u00c2Ramble On Rose\u00c3\u00c2 stands out with soaring guitar work generating appreciative applause and most of the words audibly sung with purpose.  These were the days of Jerry\u00c3\u00c2s teleprompter, so the fact that he cannot be heard on many lines is sad indeed :o(.  Nevertheless, Jerry sounds like he\u00c3\u00c2s in alright spirits as he quips \u00c3\u00c2Phil isn\u00c3\u00c2t ready yet.  You\u00c3\u00c2ll have to say something really nice to him\u00c3\u00c2 in between ROR & Black-thr. Wind.  Bobby does a great job on B.Thr. Wind.   Loose Lucy sounds great\u00c3\u00c2Jerry is on for this song, mostly, though about 5:45 into it his voice gets lost behind the instruments a bit.  \u00c3\u00c2Promised Land\u00c3\u00c2 totally rocks out and Vince\u00c3\u00c2s keyboard work is truly superb as well as distinctive from Brent\u00c3\u00c2s, whom I\u00c3\u00c2ve seen.  Set 2\u00c3\u00c2s \u00c3\u00c2Here Comes Sunshine\u00c3\u00c2 is a fun jaunt, but Jerry never really gets revved up in his guitar work (although he does hit most of the lyrics).  It is Vince instead whose playing shines here.  \u00c3\u00c2Truckin\u00c3\u00c2 is so-so, \u00c3\u00c2Rollin\u00c3\u00c2 & Tumblin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 never really gets rolling at all and is a let down.  Rhythm devils rollick however and are worth a download on their own, followed by a trippy, expansive Space.  \u00c3\u00c2Box Of Rain\u00c3\u00c2 is as good as any I\u00c3\u00c2ve heard, as is \u00c3\u00c2Standing On The Moon.\u00c3\u00c2  Jerry finally gets into a groove by this point and it becomes possible to momentarily forget this is a \u00c3\u00c295 show.  \"Samba In The Rain\" is not that great of a tune in my opinion, but the playing at least was solid here. \u00c3\u00c2Sugar Mags>Sunshine Daydream\u00c3\u00c2 perfectly reflects the mood of the day, albeit in a standard rote sort of rendition.  \u00c3\u00c2Liberty\u00c3\u00c2 encore was a bit of a letdown and is still difficult to puzzle out the words.  \n\n3 stars for stellar sound quality and not really that bad of a show, even from one as biased as I.",

Don't believe all of the bad press the late era naysayers write about the shows until you listen for yourself>\n2.) For a handful of shows in 1995, the naysayers are right and Garcia was having problems>\n3.) For most of the 95 shows, the naysayers are dead wrong.\n4.) As for this show, I will now take a listen and see if the naysayers are right..or wrong again and the show is enjoyable.\n\n2 Cents- This show is just fine thank you very much. I think the playing is solid and interesting. Folks don't like Samba, but I do. And, like other summer 95 versions, it is very well played here. HC Sunshine is great.",

As we walked in we were told the concert is free which worked out great as we didn't have any tickets.  I was never a real Deadhead but, even though Jerry wasn't at his best, I was converted for life that night.  It was near the end and I'm just glad I got to see them before it was changed forever.  \n\nI also never forget getting pulled over 2 times on the way home and somehow getting out of both of them as the smoke was wafting out from the backseat!!",

      "review_text": "Was that Jerry? Unfortunately, this was my only show.  I tried for years to get into the Boston Garden shows with no luck.  As someone else mentioned, Dylan was surprisingly good, prob. best part of the night.  \n\nJerry was a wreck.  He forgot the words, but that didn't bother me too much.  Let's be honest, he forgot the words during the best of times.  But there were moments during the show when he was looking down at his guitar like he'd never seen one before.  He was just staring at it.  Drums and Space started out good, but lasted forever (45 Mins!!!) and seemed uninspired after a while.  It became obvious that they were just waiting for Jerry to rest up.\n\nReally, everyone else did a good job, and that's what made it so hard to watch, you could tell that there was a lot of music left in this band.  When I watched the show, I gave Jerry six months - looks like I was too optomistic.\n\nListning to the show now, 10 years later, it's not quite as bad as I remember (Jerry actually sounds kind of into Ramble On Rose), but still nothing like what the Dead could be when they were on.\n\nThe camping was fun, and everyone was ready for an incredible show - it's too bad the boys couldn't keep it going longer.  Lucky we still have 30 years of live Dead to listen too.  I'm more of a 70's fan anyways.",

      "review_text": "Great scene, decent show. So many bad reviews, so I must toss in my two cents.  Jerry was close to the end, and we all knew it, so living in VT we simply wanted to be there.  '95 was more about enjoying one last time in the community and I guess that had to be your attitude going in.  My brother and I played ultimate in the afternoon, spread a blanket in the grass not too close to the stage, and knew that if we passed something one way, it would eventually come back replenished, something you don't see in the younger crowds today.  People were even sharing \"special\" water with anyone interested.  The Abenaki welcomed us to their tribal land with a song or two, and then Dylan stole the show with the best set I've seen him play. I wish you could download these two experiences to get a full sense of how special this night was.  And the Dead. . . were decent.  Phil got goofy at the end of \"He's Gone\" and \"Standing\" made me cry because I knew this was going to be my last show.  I can understand why people who weren't there wouldn't want this show, but if you know what I'm talking about how could this be missing from your collection?!\nP.S. If Jerry sounds down, blame the gate crashers as much as his health.  I mail ordered my ticket, and I was sad when word spread that people were shouting at cops and ripping down fences to get in for free.  You can bet the band  felt that way, too.",

I remember being in the backseat of my buddies VW, anticipating the time I was going to have, meeting up with friends, camping out, wakin' bake and off to another show. Granted Jerry was hurtin for certain but the Other Ones kept the groove going. I thought the show still was a good one, another experiance. Sorry for the first timers or the others that couldn't appreciate everything else in the air that day. It was a hot day man, Nitrice tanks dressed to kill with tye Dyes and hats on their cylindrical, four foot bodies! The smell of the stellar hotdogs, Skunk and the sounds of acoustic strings, bongos and people dancing along side hack circles. Good times. I still check the Other Ones out and I'm psyched I can still get the vibe when I go. Jerry would want everyone to carry on and do what he would have wanted still, smile and spread it!

There were a couple gems mixed in there but this show was bad. So much expectations, I had just graduated high school, all my friends & I had anticipated this one since the year before & left a little disaapointed. Great to hang & party, but the show was uninspired, one of the worst of '95 if not ever. Peggy-O & Ramble on Rose were my highlights, Jerry's solos are still beautiful, thats about it for the show. Everyone dogs the next show for Wharf Rat, but give SOTM a listen, Jerry just flat out gives up. I would rate this one with 1 star, I give it 2 'cause I still had a blast. Oh yeah, hearing Jerry talk to the crowd a little was cool.",

I can say I had the best band for my party and had some approx. 300,000 other guests attending. I saw Dylan and the Dead in 87 in Foxboro, MA. and was gratefully disappointed in that show. Needless to say, I was somewhat skeptical about Dylan again. His band completely rocked the place out! They were explosive!\n    At this show, Jerry Garcia appeared motionless and listless. Looking up at the screens, he did not seem like he had his eyes open during the show. He was really going downhill. The other members seemed to compensate with their musical stregnth. Garcia struggled....\n    It was great to see \"That would be something\". I always enjoyed seeing that done, and \"Ramble on Rose\", strong \"Wang Dang Doodle\" Bobby's vocals were strong and with umph! \n    I feel that the shows were loosing their edge around 93 and later. I was used to seeing the Dead in the mid 80's til the end. I felt that the whole scene was ending soon. I said to my brother as we walked into the show, \"take a good look at what were are doing because this is not going to last much longer I'm afraid\". \n    I could not believe how amazing the sound quality was at the airport. That place was expanse. By far the Dead had the best sound in music, period. They filled every inch of that place with crystal clear sound! I miss seeing the boys. If I had one more show to see again, it would be Knickerbocker Arena, Albany, NY 3/24/90 or Rich Stadium Buffalo, NY 7/90. Killer shows, check em' out!!!  God Bless.....",

He was a new college guy and we sold bagels, coffee (French Roast w/ cream aand sugar) and granola bars or fresh fruit, and water\n we made about 350 and fed a lot of hungry and scary [people who i never could have imagined that they would ever get home.\nBut for $2 for tyour chouice of three items when you are hungry certainly helped us sell fast.\n\nI remember walking the parking lot with these big thermos' tied to our backs selling coffee to people half asleep at the wheel, sitting idle and waiting hours to get out of the parking lot, butwhen they saw me and my nephew, \"Get Your Fresh French Roast Coffee Here!\"  you should have seen the eyes sparkle and a big GD smile and a grateful eye.\n\n\"Get your French roast coffee\" with cream and sugar. Chewy granola bars and apples and oranges, and water.. \"\n\nim kind of curous if anyone out there remembers being delivered coffee at 2o'clock in the morning in the parking lot in a traffic jam?\n\nThere was something very satisfying in those moments.  And we slept in the car for two nights.\n\nWe both got in early enough to hear Here Comes Sunshine practiced 2 tiems and casey jones once for the soundcheck. \n\nThe crowd was very rude and forceful and ran through the gates, it was the worst gate crashing i had ever experienced and it shows the worst in people, esp when we all know what happened at Cinci' and the Who.  \n\nAnyway we stood dead center in front of the board for the whole, sound was awesome!!!\n\nDylan took the night, Jerry did not look well so white and pale, kept getting lost between the teleprompter and i think it was throwing him off big time. You cna hear it in the hesitations in the playing.  I do remeber the moon, the flying man with the ultralight/parachute, a balloon, and an awesome Black Throated Wind.  The first set was good better than the second.  I was happy just to be there in the breezes of summer, and feeling like Jerrys days were few.  S.O.T.M was very somber and reflective of the whole dead scene at the time and poor playing.  I really think Jerry was on his orbit home.\n\nI remember the drums throwing us audibly through the uiniverse and looking at my nephew being blown away in the moment of audio fantasyland and smiling knowing i would never forget that moment,. and was glad to have the time to sharwe with him.\n\nBut I had never quite enjoyed the drums as that night and i had been to shows since 1982.\n\nI think i really was Dead Center in a manner of speaking\n\nThose are my moments I will not ever forget.

This time, taking 3 days off for the show.  Got up there a few days earlier, got a great campsite from a very welcoming farmer.  If I remember, about $25 for 3 days, and to boot, he drove around giving out free firewood, and the day of show, offered hayride shuttles to the show.  The camp was tightly packed w/ bright psychedilic colored dome tents, w/ the exception of my old boyscout style flat green triangle.  I got some great shots for memories looking down from the overpass which gave a great view. \n\nI relaxed at this one & simply chose to sit in the back on the ground.  Sound was very poor, but then again this wasn't no arena.  It was a flat old unused airport open on all sides.  I do remember that sky surfer someone just noted.  It looked like the dude hung up there forever w/ what I think I remember as a blue raft style air kite.\n\nWhat can I say, I feel lucky to have caught one of the last shows, & one of the last TOG, Peggy-O, Ramble On, Truckin, & SOTM's.  If an SBD was to be found, ratings would go a little higher.  An Aud taped on an airport runway sure didn't help.\n\nThank you Jerry & Company for all the happy memories, & Thank you archive for preserving it!",

Although had been a long time fan and had a shitload of tapes, because of school and work never got the chance to see them a ton, so for the 4 of us it was an adventure. Met a ton of cool people on Shakedown Street and walking back and forth from the only gas station intown getting ice and supplies! Once touch came on it was a magical journey for all of us. Although there were problems at the show and maybe time has hit my memory but it was one hell of a 3 day journey, something that the 4 of us talk about all the time! It was also the last summer all of us were single by the next year or so we were either married or engaged. \n\nMy point is that while musically it was not the 70's (personally I am a pigpen, keith fan more so than Brent, Bruce and Vince) the show was a blast and it is cool to read everyone's memories of the show! Something I will never forget in my life. I am getting chills listening to the show right now telling my 7 and 3 year old about Daddy being at this show! Isn't this what is all about, hanging out with your buddies listening to a band we all love and wish were still playing! Thanks for listening and don't believe the haters out there, they were probably not at the show! Enjoy Further, Phil and Friends, and DSO. just gives us another chance to recreate moments that were pretty cool! Peace all!\n\nThe stars are for the show and the memories combined!",

      "review_text": "Worst show I ever attended My last dead show, after seeing this show I pretty much told myself that was it. The scene had been growing increasingly weird to me, not the good kind.\nI was amazed at how many people thought it was a killer show as I walked the long walk to my car. I said then that it was the worst concert I had seen by any band, ever, up till that point. Maybe a bit harsh but man oh man, so many lyrical and other musical flubs, I remember actually wincing. I remember telling my friends that something was seriously wrong with Jerry. I don't understand how people can here this and give it 2 stars let alone 5! Sorry to be so negative but this is a bad bad show and it should be criminalized immediately. :)",

Have to give it 5 for the overall 'experiance' not to mention a sweet Peggy O and Liberty\n\nI remember roling joints for these 2 older guys in their plymouth in Enosburg Falls campground and they wanted to take me on tour with them to be their 'official' joint roller and i;d get paid to do it! Ya! 18 yrs old...why not...of coarse I never saw them later during the show or after......then there was waiting in line while listening to Dylan and then hearing that the gates had been crashed......so....how was Dylan that night? anyone? hmmmm......then there was being waaaaay to far from the stage, but getting to see stuff on the screen and feeling like because i was by myself and high, I wouldnt be able to squirm my way around people without getting lost in there space as i went...hard enough to stand alone in my own space! but that SPACE! WOW!!! THAT alone made the show......I think I remember reading in Phils memoir that he was particularly annoyed with Garcia this night(i think i read that? anyone again?) and it was funny to hear Garcia say \"where just waiting for Phil now\" little love jabs.........just met my doctor who saw the last Chicago show and just by chance mentioned my time at Highgate the same summer, forgetting that today was THAT day 15 yrs ago!!!! I love syncronicity! GOOD OL GRATEFUL DEAD!!!",

It was the first show I actually bought tickets and got in only to see about ten thousand gate crashers come running behind me, bummer.  Jerry looked and sounded terrible but the moment was wonderful because I finally got in.  I remember taking a wrong turn and ended up going over the bridge into Canada.  As my girlfriend and myself were pulling up to speak with customs I heard dogs barking and nearly soiled my shorts thinking it was guard dogs.  Turns out these old hippies behind us brought thier dogs. lol.  We camped in some dudes backyard and had a great time the night before only to witness a pretty crappy scene with too many wannabees and not enough kindness.  Shortly after when Jerry passed I was walking down a street in Nashua, New Hampshire while taking a break from a moving job I was on.  Two girls noticing my tie-dye pulled over to tell me Jerry died.  I didn't want to believe them.  Years later I caught a Ratdog show in Utica, NY and have been trying to catch Bobby and the boys no matter what band they are with but never will forget that weekend in Highgate.  Wish you were here Jerry!!!",

I traveled forward about 50 feet before I touched the ground. I was tired of waiting to get in anyway and I was not harmed, so life goes on. The Dead had their ups and downs over the night but an interesting show,some interesting tunes in the set list, but Jerry was obviously not felling well. I thought this was still a pretty good show. Killer drumz-space> box of rain, in this one hang on to something for balance. \nIt had a huge two tier sound system set up\nwith the gatecrashers there were 100,000 freaks \n- it was a silver star kind of show.\nI do remember that this show made me happy.\n Be Kind \nPeace and Happiness be \nJerry Always gave everything that he had !!!",

God bless him for blessing all of us with his talents. That show and that whole tour was fd up, but thats what society was at that time. Not the band. They were always about it man, for their people.

      "review_text": "Seriously missed opportunity I am a 'reformed Deadhead' who saw the band about 30 times in the 1970s; my younger brother, who must have caught 'the bug' from me, followed the guys around on his vacations (which he took to jive with the summer tours, naturally) in the mid-80s to mid-90s.  I kept buying the Dicks Picks, VttV and so forth CDs and trading 'the tapes' ('ancient,' yes); unfortunately, by that time I was running my own business and had too many hungry kids to feed!  So we never saw a show together.  To his credit my bro' kept banging that tune on the side of his white VW bus with the 'cow' horn (anybody remember it?  It had Jersey plates, ha ha), 'Come on, man, at least come see ONE gig!'  Well, this gig is the one he came closest to convincing me to attend (my family had a summer house in Highgate Springs a couple of decades before).  First, a caveat.  Often when I mention my Dead affliction to people (once I even got the following comment from an ATF agent, square biz), they  say, 'You got to see them when they were good!'  Not so.  Not so at all.  Yeah, the band had a performance template later on.  Well, Rembrandt didn't?  Miles Davis didn't?  The Budapest String Quartet didn't?  Forget all that.  I have a version of 'Dark Star' from the '90s that beats crap out of the take on LIVE DEAD.  Fine, every tune wasn't the best version every time.  So what.  Anyway.  I was within inches of deciding to go, but no, I had become, as Jerry once put it, 'old and in the way' (at 40...) so I said to my bro', 'Next year for sure.'  Yeah, right.  Let this be a lesson to all of us.  Anyway (again), my brother and I had a serious falling out about 8 years ago and we no longer talk, but when I came across this web site and noted that this gig was available, I downloaded it without thinking.  After listening to it, I have to say, yeah, it was not the best.  Jerry was sick and it shows. Phil, Vince, Bobby, Mickey and Bill were doing their best to help him out.  At the end of 'Truckin',' there is a serious 'out-of-sync' moment.  Well, I still wish I'd been there, just to have been there and felt that vibe once more.  To yell when Jerry cracked, 'Phil's not ready yet; you're going to have to think of something nice to say to him...'\n To say nothing of hanging out with my 'bro.  Sorry for all this 'Too Much Info', people.  I miss the band and I miss my bro'.  Take a tip from an ancient headbanger.  If your heart says 'jump,' do it.  Enough already.  (P.S.  My rating is based on hearing the recoding, which of course is very biased).  Peace.",

I attended both Highgate shows as they were close, but we all knew the good days were past. Too bad I missed Dylan, sounds like that was the real ticket that night.

It was a sad day, Jerry's funeral and he mostly played that way because I believe Jerry and the band knew his death was near. I'll still take a half dead Jerry show over no Jerry show anyway of the week. I was young so drinking and mushrooms which we bought fake ones was important to a degree. Also ecstasy...... The music was good to hear one last time live and a good getaway to fine Vermont. The scene was out of control. Wouldn't change myself going for the world.",

      "review_text": "People sure do have odd memories First of all, there was no crashing of the gate. That would imply there was a gate to crash. After the fence fell over, and that is indeed what happened as I was one of the individuals sitting against the fence when it, along with myself and my friends, fell over toward the \u201cinside\u201d. I watched as the man fell from the tree limb; I watched as he was taken away by ambulance. I, along with my friends, had tickets for this show yet at the moment the fence fell were not on the ticket carrying side. I imagine there were others with tickets who were also \u201coutside\u201d the perimeter when the fence fell. Regardless, it was due to the force of our sitting against that particular section of fence that it fell over. I can certainly testify to how flimsily it was pieced together. As to the energy at this show, I\u2019ve experienced bad energy surrounding and inside shows and this was not one of them. In fact, Madison Square Garden, inside and out, is where the worst of the energies emanated. Talk about chaos and frightening scenes. Now that locale was always saddening to witness. Vermont is Vermont. Even in the huge traffic jam on the highway it was easy to find enjoyment. And a huge thank-you to the father and son selling food after the show. It was both needed and delicious.",

Truckin, SOTM & Sugar Mag were all played the year before, made for a disappointing end to a poorly played show.  The year before was so much more fun.  They never should have added Dylan to this date, just assured that waaay to many people showed up.  2 stars only because they played a concert.",

I'll never forget it.\n\nfor one thing, on arrival, I saw out the window of our van, this scraggly hippie dude thrashing flowersticks / devilsticks.  first time I'd ever seen them and was mesmerized.  long story short, I got a set and have been playing with them (not the same set obviously) for almost 25 years now, and they've transformed my life in so many ways.\n\nbut to the show!  just amazing, I remember Bob Dylan being iconic and unintelligible; Touch of Gray stands out especially in my mind; some politician was there too as a guest, but I don't remember who it was - Bernie?  Patrick Leahy?  Someone, but that was neat.\n\nand then there was the fence.  that really stood out.  I had left our crew in the middle of the crowd to go find food or a bathroom or something I don't recall, I think it was food.  found my way over towards the fence where there were a bunch of white easy-ups IIRC along the side, but I was down towards the entrance-end of them.  anyhow, on the other side of the fence was a small hill running parallel to the fence.\n\nall along the side of the fence were people without tickets wanting to get in.  positioned along the outside of the fence at regular intervals were cops with dogs.  everyone was just there all chill... until one guy on the hill stands up, makes some gesture (I think he might've thumped his chest with his hands once), a \"what are you gonna do about it?\" kinda body language, and started walking down the hill towards the fence and cops.\n\nthings started moving very quickly at this point.  first one, then another stand up to join this guy, then all of a sudden everyone on the hill is up and moving quickly towards the fence.  people are climbing the fence, cops are dragging people off it, dogs are jumping and presumably biting, but the cops aren't enough and soon the fence is covered in people, and, well, it just tipped right over.\n\nit was about this time, with what looked to be about a hundred people maybe 20 yards from me now streaming towards me, that I decided to turn tail and run back into the crowd to avoid getting trampled.\n\nso that was fun.  super super memorable highlight to an otherwise crazy amazing experience.",
