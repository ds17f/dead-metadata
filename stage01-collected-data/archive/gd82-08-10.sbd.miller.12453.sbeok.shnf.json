And then, with a kick from Mickey's snare, he's out of the gate like a thoroughbred...every note just keeps flowing from his mind to his hands like it was all thought out before-hand, breakneck yet lyrical, culminating in a beautiful sequence of an escalating arpeggiated figure (classic Jerry trademarks) that just leave your jaw dropping.\n\nActually, if you listen to Eyes from earlier this same tour, you hear the genesis of the ideas for the solos in those versions, but it all came together on 8-10.",

This show was the end of the west/midwest tour.  I had caught about 12 of the 14 or so shows starting in Ventura.  I was going to school at boulder and was heading east after this night to see my rents for a couple of weeks before heading back out west again.  \n\nThe energy in the field house was high and so was I...so for years I have wanted to hear it again to be sure that it wasn't just one of those moments.  I remember out in the parking lot after the show I grabbed a beer out of the cooler and joined a conversation between some friends of mine about the show.  Still heavily dosed I innocently said \"yeah and what about that Stella Blue\" and everyone in our little discussion as well as some close by all answered in unison....\"Yeeaahhhh.  That was something\". \n\nStella can be an unwelcome staple that sucks the life and energy out of the back side of a smokin second set.  However, this one is pure.  Jerry is crying like the wind as he sings like a broken angel from his guitar.  It oooozes!!",

And you just have to listen to Sugar Mags to understand.

We went to a hotel where there were parties the night before the show. the hotel caught on so on the second night they called the cops who came into lobby & said \"everyone go to your rooms\". we were pretty freaked. some head yelled out to me and a friend that we should go to room \"such & such\" - so we went to that room and knocked on the door. Phil Lesh answered the door - we must have looked pretty nervous cause he invited us in, handed us something & said \"here you look like you need this\". everyone was there but Jerry....",

Great show...  Lots of energy.  Especially that Bertha to end the first set.\n\nUpdate on 8//10/82:   Going back and listening to summer 1982 aka my last summer before graduating from law school and having a real life to attend to.  Starting to think this summer tour was much better than I thought when attending a few of the shows, and when listening to audience tapes shortly thereafter.....  maybe it's the crispiness of many of the uploads.... maybe it's not being stoned to the bejesusbelt 24/7....  whatever the case, I'm taking a liking to summer of '82.....  As for this one....well played with boundless energy.... As noted in my original review, that Bertha.... similarly, that Eyes.... and I loved those late 70's early 80's Iko's....  more bluesy that the set openers of the mid-80's through '95....  Much as I loved the NFA's of that era [5/3/79 being a favorite] better than the show ending pop-rock tune..... long story longer and far more tedious.... some amazing memories of my trip to Iowa City....  and, a very fine show as well.....

This version of Baby Blue is magical. I didn't think I would ever say this but I like it even more than when Dylan was doing it in the Rolling Thunder Review back in '75. I always like when people do Dylan covers especially Jerry but hardly ever do I like them more than Dylan's own interpretations of his songs. This one is very, very good. Check it out. Usually, with the encores, I could take them or leave them but not at this show. \n\nOn a side note I just wanted to mention how lucky I feel to stumble upon this one here at the archive. A lot of the reviews here bash this era for reasons that don't make any sense to me. People have to knock Brent, praise Keith, and even put Jerry down. I am glad this show has not been polluted with such ignorant reviews yet. It truly is a gem beyond tangible value and I feel sorry for anyone who is afraid to listen due to preconceived notions about the state of the band during this period.",

When I went into this show, I can honestly say I knew only \"Truckin'\", \"Johnny B. Goode\", and \"On The Road Again', and I only knew it because my friends and I watched an HBO special on the Dead a week earlier and they did that song on it. When my room mate would play the Dead I would ask him how he could listen to them because they sucked. Then I saw this show. I was already hooked by \"Friend Of The Devil\" and the next day I bought 7 Dead albums. We had 10th row seats on the floor, and I was just in awe watching them. The people were cool, I was astounded at the number of tapers, and the Deadheads behind us who moved their chairs so they could sit on the floor. I remember hearing one of them say that they thought the second set on the second night in Chicago was a better show than this one. I remeber thinking \"How can you say that? You aren't even listening to this one\" I also remember them wishing they would play \"Franklin's Tower\". A lot of the banter between songs has been cut out of this show. This was supposed to be the last show in the Field House, as the new Carver-Hawkeye Arena was due to open in a few months. I remember Bobby making a comment about how we needed to build them a new place to play in next time. This show hooked me on the Dead and I've been sharing them with everyone I can ever since. I still have my ticket and my shirt from this show, and in a very strange coincidence, this show opened with \"Feel Like A Stranger\" and \"Friend Of The Devil\", and the other show I saw in CR in 7-4-84 opened with the exact same two songs, in the same order. This is a phenomenal show, and if you want it downloaded, I have two words for you. RECORD IT. There are free programs that you can use for that out there like Audacity.

At first, the distortion is a distraction to the listener, but, the GD are playing well and take a beer barrel break and just left it up to the engineers to mix the sound, and voila'! the whole sizzling omelet eased into an astoundingly raccous \"On The Road Again\" and glided thru Beat It into Stagger. By the first verse of Stagger, the sound is strong and unfettered. Finally! I understand why so many rave about this U. of Iowa show in Iowa City, Iowa. \n\nWhat transpires is everything everybody agreeing that this is such a beautiful recording of a beautifully executed performance from the end of the first set's Miracle into fire-breathing Bertha.\n\nSecond set opens with a meteorite shake China Cat>Rider which breaks free of lead-lined walls. Sailor is a welcome restbit, but Saint is a three minute mile into Eyes, and they just go CRAZY on Eyes. Jerry is just all over it seventh magnitude.\nThe sound is rich and vibrant.

Bobby is going askance throughout the entire process with all these insane sideways chords and fills to what Jerry's so casually and effortlessly laying down. What does it do to a listener? It puts a listener exterior. And then, after all this insane back and forth, Bobby tries to launch into Around but Jerry heads him off at the pass and turns it into Sugar. Pure 151 Rum.\n\nDouble encore. A Baby Blue and their personal acknowledgement of a brilliant performance, Johnny B Goode.\n\nI do not believe I have ever heard a GD concert which features as much striking and riveting interplay between Bobby and Jerry.  \n\nThis show is near perfection.",

I'd only been to one other show before, at the Rosemont in Chicago when I thought Sampson and Delilah was going to cause the roof to collapse and Bill's brother drove the wrong way down the off ramp on the way back to Iowa.\n\nA hoist of our own petarra?

I got married to my high school sweetheart later that summer and have been for 27 years or so. And while that long strange trip may not last much longer, I'll always have 82. Especially now that the Music Never Stops.\n\n Thanks all of you for sharing. Go Hawks! Go Rat Dogs! Go Drums and Space. Go Further and further. We'll be back in a little bit....  chrs,\n\nBanjo Reno82",

      "review_text": "Umm, Phil..... they *did* build a better place to play I was at this one as well as the previous thirteen going back to 7-17-82. Comments previous about the vibe, cops, etc are all spot on. The energy was *there*.\n\nThe music was *there*.\n\nThe comment before the encore is from Phil not Bob, first praising the Heads that had been on tour for the previous month and then indirectly the university and the Iowa City community. Curiously, not far from this decaying old field house they were finishing up the Carver-Hawkeye Arena. There, Phil, your better place to play. Yet the Dead never came back to Iowa City. And only came to Iowa one last time to play in Cedar Rapids in 1984 (another good show, BTW).\n\nI've never lived in Iowa, I never attended the University of Iowa, but from the experience of this show, I have been a Hawkeyes football fan ever since.",

      "review_text": "82?? Iowa??? I plead ignorance... 82-84 is the Dead era of which I've heard the least. I have to say I'm really surprised. this is a tight, energetic performance with some great jams and many standout performances. I would give this a 4 1/2 but that option doesn't exist.\nAll the highlights have been covered below but an honourable mention to a rare electric On The Road Again into Beat It On Down The Line. Just a stellar performance. The Dead at their most fun.\n\n\"C'mon Bobby\"... hilarious. Brent sounds like a children's singer trying to get the kids to sing along.",

I can tell you that..The sound quality in on point with a great song selection..Love the \" Technical Difficulties> On The Road again I'll take that any day..The 1st set ends with pure power with a nice Stagger Lee,I Need A Miracle Bertha..I would need intermission to come back down from that sweet combo..There is a mellow hush before they break into smoking China>Rider and a well played Sailor/Saint with an epic Eyes of The World..Jerry just goes off!! A perfect Iko Iko out of space to get things going again and a continuous flow of good playing music from there..I love the double encore and I'm a big fan of It's All Over Now Baby Blue..so please GIVE IT A WHIRL",

We barely got to St Paul. Bad directions in some backroads. Needed some repairs and had just enough to cover. Alpine was close to home and we were able to switch cars during that show. \nOn to U of Iowa. I was beginning grad school there in 2 weeks time. That field house was old and run down but it provided great sound. At the top of the hill on the river between the dorms and right down the street from where I got my doctorate degree. Would cut through there and it was a true field house. They set up folding chairs that were quickly dispensed with. The entire week + was outstanding and memorable. \n\nThis one was awesome. Great tunes but they were on!! And all week was no/little cops. Good weed and other curriculars. \n\nThey went on to the west coast but I stayed in iowa to study. \n\nFond memories. A good time was had by all. \n\nAlways saw great shows in iowa. I recall a July 4th in Cedar Rapids that was awesome as well. ",
