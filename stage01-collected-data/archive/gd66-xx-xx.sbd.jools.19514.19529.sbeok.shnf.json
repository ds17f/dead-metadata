Jeff Tiedrich: a mutual friend asked Dick Latvala if he could shed any additional light on the above material and Dick answered that this was from a 7\" reel that came out of a box that was only labeled \"Longshoreman's.\" No date or any other information. Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear from 'The taping Compendium': According to Vault archivist Dick Latvala, the material here comes from two different seven-inch reel boxes, the Pigpen rap in an unlabeled one, the other marked \"Longshoreman's #1,\" with no other information. The intriguing thing is that both tapes have identical ambiences, and Bobby's comment has the same ambience and feel as the segment with Pigpen's rap. Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley: the box labeled \"Longshoreman's\" would have been the shows we did with Loading Zone in late April 66, after the return to SF from LA. \"",

Windows Media Player has a 10 band EQ and SRS WOW effects that enhance the sound.\n\nHere's one way to download this show:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer. RealPlayer is a free media player you can download at www.realplayer.com. \n\nUsing RealPlayer to view this webpage, click the VBR M3U link to open the songs in the Playlist. If your Playlist is not open, open it by clicking the Playlist icon at the lower right hand corner of RealPlayer. Once the songs are in the Playlist, double click the song to play it, then click the record button at the lower left hand corner of Realplayer to record it. \n\nWhen the red line reaches the other end click the stop button to download the song. Your song is in the RealPlayer Downloads folder. Repeat these steps for each song.\n\nEat, Drink, Be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nThanks for the LOVE from 1972. \n\nPS: Get em' while you can, get em' while they're free, get em' now or you'll be sorry...the Man giveth and the Man taketh away...WTTW",

      "review_text": "Mystery Reel This snippet circulates in (even) better quality as part of the \"Mystery Reels\" compilation (search for \"81254\"). \n\nAccording to the notes that accompany that source, this reel is labeled \"Longshoreman's Hall 1st Night,\" with no date. If this was recorded at a run at the Longshoreman's Hall, it could be from either the \"Trips Festival\" (January 22 & 23) or the \"Trips 196? Festival\" (April 22, 23, 24). \n\nI agree with the previous guess that is most likely April 22 (if it is from Longshoreman's at all) because BIODTL has beats at beginning. If this is indeed April 22, it is the first recorded BIODTL with beats.",
