There isn't even a hint at the end of Spanish Jam that Born Cross-Eyed is coming up next. For what's here, it's just average. The sound quality is fine, but the jam is for the most part uninspired.

Just as the correct date for the show archived here as 1/22 is in fact 1/26. 1/26-27 are the only dates played in Seattle on this, the Dead's first tour. \nAs for the Spanish Jam, it's worth a listen, as are all Spanish Jams from this period, but not as good as 1/20 or \"1/22\".",

I listened to the SJ archived here at 1.23.68 and the SJ listed here as 1.27.68 and found not one point of similarity.  I leave room for the possibility that the SJ listed here as 1.27.68 is a continuation of the SJ contained on the 1.23.68 page - that is, it may come after the end cut of 1.23.68 (ie Tape flip).  If that were the case, I have no idea how much time is missing.\n\nOn Nemo's other points, regarding the acutal dates of the Eagles Aud. shows, I agree that Deadlists seems to have strong confirmation that there were only Seattle shows on 1/26 and 1/27.",

      "review_text": "1/23 probably belongs with this I like this as well (though 1/20 & 1/22 from this tour are better).  Interesting mix, though, with bass very high up & prominent.\n\nPrimarily interesting because, of course, this may be the end of the show labeled 1/23 (that show was almost certainly mis-dated on the vault reels).  Audio signature is quite different from the beginning of Spanish Jam on the Archive shows dated 1/23 -- but if we assume that these were all taken from 4-track masters, the difference may simply be a function of the manner in which the four tracks were reduced to two.\n\nIf that is actually the case, then between this, the Archive tape dated 1/23, and the hour's worth of material (also dated 1/23) that came out on Road Trips v2n2, then we'd have almost 1:50 worth of music (that might have run something like this)...\n\nSet 1:\nLovelight\nDark Star > China Cat > Eleven\nBIODTL\n\nSet 2:\nViola\nHurts Me Too\nTIFTOO > Clementine > NPC > BCE > Spanish Jam\n\n...which gives us a pretty good feeling for what the shows on this tour were probably like.\n\n\n",
