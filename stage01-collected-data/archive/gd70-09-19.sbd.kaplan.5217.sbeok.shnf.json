On this night, something extra seemed to be in the air.  Was it the fact that Jimi Hendrix had been found dead the night before(with Janis short to follow)?  Something pursueded the dead that night in NY, and the emotions were bold as love.  \nThe Dark Star starts out in a somber mood, and evolves into an electrical thunderstorm of improvisation and pshychedelia.  Tbe spirit of Hendrix lies within the music forever captured here, and was truely a magical Experience.  What the rest of the show had to offer, is maybe lost forever, along with the heart and soul of Jimi Hendrix...Being that only part of the show has surrfaced, This and the life of Hendrix are two masterpieces cut short, and before their time.\nEnjoy",

As it is, the Dark Star is so magical and well played, I have to give it 5 stars. Not too many Dark Stars in 1970 have this kind of luminescence. Worth getting! Now wonder what the Morning Dew opener sounded like? UPDATE - let me add that the band is playing very well on all these tracks, very polished they don't waste a note from St. Stephen on to the end. Plus, I just realized this fantastic 20 minute Lovelight also has the dubious distinction of being the only one I know of where, in the middle of his \"hands in your pockets\" rap, Pigpen instructs the guys on how to pick up the ladies by saying - \"Hey maam, let's FUCK\" - and the crowd goes wild! Definitely not PC, but that's Pig. A high energy show and again, with the entire show this could be one of year's best. Where or where??\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

Jerry is most assuredly playing a Dark Star for Jimi. He opens with a beautiful wistful eulogy for their fallen psychedelic comrade. The lyrics are sung very deliberately with a special emphasis on the \"shall we go, you and I WHILE WE CAN\". A really dark sad \"void\" follows the lyrics before a gorgeous and powerful resurrection finishes it off. An extraordinarily emotional and cohesive Dark Star...better than any of the classics I've heard so far. WOW. The rest of this show is a very joyous wake. Very nice quality taboot. 5++",

Played the day after Jimi Hendrix died, it seems like Bob and Jerry are possessed by his spirit.  They fire into the jam at about the 16th minute and never look back.  The band hits 3 distinctive peaks, before settling back into Dark Star, and transitioning into St. Stephen.  The Not Fade Away absolutely rips, with a great China Cat jam.  Do Not pass this up.",

Great St. Stephen, incredible NFA (with two very interesting jams sandwiched in between), and an unforgettable Lovelight, with the following exchange:\nPigpen: \"Ain't no use in playin' no games. If you're next to some young lady, just say, 'Uh, ma'am, let's fuck.'\"\nBobby: \"Uh Pigpen, did you say 'fuck'?\"\nPigpen: \"I said 'FUCK!!!!!'\"\nClassic. \n\nThe only thing I will quibble about (as much as I can quibble about this fantastic show) is the Dark Star. Yes it's certainly excellent, but is it the greatest ever, like everybody says? No. 12/6/73, 11/2/69, 2/13/70, 2/27/69, 11/11/73, and a few others are considerably better than this one.

      "review_text": "this show is a gem Fantastic set. . . tight all around from start to finish.  This is my dead era . . . \n\nThe Dark Star is exceptional, pure magic.  It has a trippy middle section that goes into a fantastic jam and eventually comes back to the tradtional DS medley.  Some might argue it's not the best one played, but who cares really.  It's right up there with the best of the best.\n\nThe St. Stephen actually is well played note for note, the intro is well done and comes on strong into a slow paced rendition for this era.  After the middle transition they pick it up considerably with the energy to go into one of the best NFA's I've ever heard.\n\nNFA is steller because of the energy, and due to the fact they played two high octane jams during it.  This show has the best of the four darkness jams for sure.  I can listen to this over and over.  Drums and guitar are in perfect match . . . \n\nLovelight is per usual for this era, PigPen going on rants and rolls with the music.  A long one but one that you can make it easily through from start to finish.  (I say this because some of these can go on and on.) Great jams throughout with Jerry hanging onto the theme and just going at it.  \n\nFYI . . . download the matrix mix of this.  80% SBD with the remainder being two AUD mixes I believe.  Amazing quality . . . hats off to the matrixer Chris Chappell.  You can find the BT pretty easily . . . with plenty of seeders usually . . . cough . . . bt.etree.org (Get all your tunes here people! Seed the music!)\n\n\n;)",

      "review_text": "The Fucking Lovelight Hi-lights- Mornings dew, Easy Wind, Dark Star > St. Stephen > Darkness, Darkness jam > Turn On Your Love Light**\n\n\nThis is your classic 70\u2019s show great set-list and a great lovelight. The taper is said to be Marty Weinberg but that is not a fact but just speculation. If it was Marty that in deed record this wasn\u2019t his usual superb work. The show takes patience to listen to but if your a dead head youll tough it out and the music will prevail. I love the easy wind, its a great prelude to what bobby did the following night ripping away at the solo. nothing insane but still a great show in my opinion. I love the loveight,since you can tell pig\u2019s drank a little to much as usual lol. At one point he even gets the audience involved in playing match maker and the jams are great to like most lovelights with that great comeback ending of \u201clet it shine, let it shine, let it shine\u201d. and man what a show and an audience you hear them shouting out the words as loud as the band motivating them as much as the dead were to the audience. sound quality is ok but i didn't let me hold back from listening to it for the first set  but the second set is a must have, trust me.\n  \nBobby- \u201cPig pend did you say fuck\u201d   \nPig-  \u201ci said FUCK! now let me tell yall a dirty story\u201d\n\n\nNOTE: \n*The first part of the show is only available in the AUD version by Marty Weinberg since the dead were facing some equipment trouble. Bu t From The Dark Star to the end its fucking amazing quality!*\n\nThis show is labeled as many others which are wrong!! The True 9-19-1970 set-list\n\nMorning Dew, Me and My uncle, good morning lil school girl,  cold rain and snow, easy wind, Dark Star > St. stephen > NFA > Darkness, Darkness Jam >  Chinacat Sunflower Jam > NFA (Reprise) > Turn On Your Lovelight**\n\nSource- Marty Weinberg and \u201cThe Dead Heads Taping Compendium\u201d\n\nWill Trade Shows - Albarracin@vzw.blackberry.net - you need hem i got e\u2019m no money just for free. Just spread the music and love the dead stood for. And yes i have this one whole set-list including SBD ending thats awesome",

I was at most of the '70's Fillmore E. shows and if I had missed the Youngbloods someone woulda told me by now   :-)  Check the crowd noise, during Get Together. it's consistent with the lights being turned on.

I won't review the music, others have already sung this night's praises wonderfully.  \n\nI give this show a \"five\" with the understanding that this work of art is infinite in its legacy, transcending space and time...so ranking it, really is somewhat meaningless.\n\nGans played this as part of a special extended DeadHour after Jerry's passing.  I remember sitting in my buddy Jumbo's basement in '95, XLIIs ready, with a few choice friends - both young and old...recording everything from that amazing FM broadcast.  It was a night I'll cherish forever because of the friends, the moment in time, and because of the symphonic masterpieces that Jerry inspired.",

You can hear the minds and walls melting!Then to be lifted straight back out by Saint Stephen. Also, the China Cat had wonderful dual guitar tones and interplay. I was like is there another guitar player, other than Bobby, accompanying Garcia? Certainly not. The Get Together, which is not the GD or any other live band is a recording NO DOUBT. We have been to the shows and know the drill! That song really captured that time though and how apprpriate with the audience riding out on a cloud and clapping in unison with the intermittent horn blowing. I can so imagine it I can almost taste it. I have been transported.",

His guitar was truly awesome back then. ",
