I thought the band was peaking in late 1989 into 1990. After this show, I was very impressed at how well the band played and the strong song selection. Big jamming tunes like Birdsong and Playin, said to me that this band was on a mission to take the music to higher level, nothing could stop them.\nVince's synth and vocals was a big departure from Brent, but he fit very well for his first show. For all that, I give them 5 stars. Check it out!!",

It's actually quite interesting to listen to Vince as he is trying hard come up with interesting licks throughout the show, which is something I've never really heard him do before.

The first set is pretty good and the rest of the band steps up, aware that they're a man down, so to speak.\n\nOn the otherside, I always thought they came up with a replacement for Brent a tad fast.

      "review_text": "Yummy I decided to look up the first show they played after Brents passing. I looked at the set list and thought , well thats about a 4 star line up right there (im a sucker for some of those Jerry ballads like Crazy and Peter) plus a reckognized Knockin' encore. I was looking for that , or he's gone. Naturally i found one of the two. After reading a few reviews i thought i would check out a few songs. \nThe master piece with the coco-cola bridge is excellent indeed, and it really seems to drive the song fourth into the final verses. Of course, the show case of the first set is the Bird Song. Its rather chunky , and in sync with what they were doing at the time before Vince joined . Its very enjoyable , and instantly one of my most likeable bird songs. Jerry starts laying into the notes before subtley backing off into a light , lifting lead back into the song. Its wonderful and i recommend a listen .",

It was getting that way before Jerry almost died, then I think they got a reality check and put it together for a couple more years.\n\nThey just toured too much.

Sold alot of GD books that weekend. The sudden death of Brent caught us all off guard,we had no time to grieve, folks had come from far and wide for three nights of our favorite band The Grateful Dead. The loss of yet another keyboard player,and the band still \"trucking on\" inspired all of us.\n    Listening to this show brings back all those memories for me. I think it's a damn good recording with fine selection of the songs of that era. \"I don't know what we were going for\"but we all,the band and the fans were were gonna make it. Gratefull Deadness was in the air,a cosmic life force reflecting the spirit and power of this \"long,strang trip\" we were all on.\nWe all might done things differently in hindsight, but the band did what they did best and that was to play the best they could on this night.",

Obviously, emotions were high after Brent's death. Nothing against Vince personally - I know he was trying, but it was really difficult to get used to his sound.  One of the three 10-song first sets I saw in 1990, which was a bonus, but still just not anywhere near equal to those w/ Brent.  \n\nand though those below who say this was a great Bird Song (for the 90s) are right to a certain extent - look no further than the one I also saw at this same venue a year later (9/6/91) for a version with a truly meltdown closing jam....hey now, I always hesitate to say anything negative, so i'll just state that the post-Brent Dead shows got a lot better once Bruce joined the group.  Vince did his best on his own, but it just didn't cut it after Brent.  That's my humble opinion.",

If you can sort through all the yammering about Vince and just listen to this show you're in for a real treat.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the merits:\n\n* A 10-song first set, including classic GD songs and featuring a sweet Bird Song, nice Ramble on Rose, a rocking cowboy combo, a great version of Masterpiece and hot US Blues to close.\n* Solid pre-drums, with a nice Truckin>Crazy transition and a great PITB -- maybe the best Playin of 1990?\n* A tight band, with something to prove the first night out after Brent\u2019s death. Listen to Weir, he\u2019s very good on this night.\n* An unvarnished look at Vince, before the pairing with Hornsby. Jerry introduces him to the fans after Bird Song.\n* An historic show. Many songs take on powerful meaning in Brent\u2019s absence \u2013 Cold Rain, Bird Song, Know u Rider, Truckin, Crazy Fingers, Black Pete(!), Knockin\n* Crystal clear and beautifully-mixed SBD recording that has just enough of a matrix feel.\n\nYes, Vince is a little tentative, but give the guy a break, it's his first show playing for the Grateful Dead, and I think he pulls it off beautifully.",

The guys absolutely should have taken a break, chose Vince too hastily and then threw him to the wolves by not postponing shows to at least give him some time to get up to speed. I remember him furiously thumbing through a music book as they played these first shows. We had already bought tickets for the first three shows of this tour before Brent died or I wouldn't have gone. The celebratory mood of the crowd seemed odd to me. \n\nThe boys did step it up a notch to compensate, for sure. Long first set and some decent jams. Nothing really stands out except maybe Bird Song. Vince does a great job all things considered. But the importance of Brent was revealed to anyone who didn't already realize it and things went steadily south with a few exceptions. I only went to two more shows after Philly, the last being Deer Creek '92.\n\nI've actually warmed up to Vince over the years, but he was put in an unwinnable situation. The dude was talented. As Donna once said, \"As a whole, in general, the Grateful Dead is not benign.\" I think 3 is generous for this show. Probably above average for the last 10 years of the band and a solid C- compared to the recorded history of the band. The sound quality is really good overall but the keys are too high at the beginning.",

Garcia was monumental perhaps the best guitar player in American history. The entire band seems really happy playing this show what a phenomenal band the Grateful Dead. Here is a Vince story: I met Vince in SF when he was visiting a concert at The Stone where these guys were doing accapela grateful dead which was strange in itself. We were at a Pub across the street. I said \"Hi Vince I just caught you at that performance with The Tubes at the Marin Art Festival\" he replies \"I don't know what your talking about man?\" This was sincere he was being really friendly we talked for awhile, he had no recollection of any whereabouts or memory. Let me explain, he was there obviously because I watched him play about 20 feet from my location on this tiny stage in Marin. That was the \"H\" factor, Vince had a severe drug problem so extreme that he was Hunter S Thompson level spaced out with no memory of where he had been or where he was going. That was a wake up call for me as to the possible extremes of drug use and partying damage. Love The Dead!",
