Jerry was jus , well, pretty awful. Bird song was the same way - he was just off ....both on his guitar and singing. The opening chords are not the vivarant notes you expect when Bird Song comes out of the chute. Its almost as tho Brent needs to take over the leads as Jerry doesnt seem on the ball. Get Back is as terrible as you read about. Its actually humerous to wonder whats goin thru bobbys head trying to sing Mccartney notes. In either case, Healy managed further damage with the sound effects. All in all , its laughably terrible , and if it is within your nature to get a chuckle out of a poorly performed evening , and laugh at how wrong things can go during a live performance...Download this now!!!!!! Mebbe i should go lighter on em , since this was just 8 shows into being back together again after Jerrys coma. Kudos to them for trying something new? lol. They werent slated to kick off spring tour for another month and change so i guess they were a bit rusty this night,lol. \nBut do listen to the Get Back for nostalgic purposes , and you can tell other people *yeah i listened to it ..it was pretty harsh*  Then download something from maybe the Hampton run a few months later during the begining of spring tour. \nI will give this show a 2 star rating cuz the sound quality is actually decent - and i really don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing.",

Even worse than Get Back is Around and Around, which is probably the worse ever. Bob's slurred speech--he can only seem to produce vowels and the letter \"s.\" He squeeks  his traditional screams. The whole band seems to forget how the song begins. Mercifully, they remember how to end it.\n\nLackluster Jerry? He can barely croak out a sound at the beginning of Peggy and Eyes. He recovers somewhat, in that he can produce sound out of his throat. Roses is awesome? Maybe in the sense that Jerry hits most of the notes, something he couldn't do in most of the other songs. The wrong notes on guitar are sad, considering what a phenomenal guitarist he once was. Twenty years of abusing his body may have had something to do with it. \n\nArchive reviewers who give a '77 show a 3 because they liked Barton better should get a grip and listen to this show.",

This version of Peggy-O is possibly the most beautiful of the decade; there is a moment where Jerry reflects on the most solemn and beautiful solo the song has ever seen. I guess ultimately in life you either get it or you don't. I always remember, \"Sometimes you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\"",

      "review_text": "In The Crowd (first entry) Hello, Readers.  \nWelcome to Shiney Mike's \"In The Crowd\" series of Show reviews. Hope I can add to the discussion in an enlightening, informative honest manner you will enjoy...\n\nIn particular - at this show, I was aware of rarity - and that there were very few obstacles to my pursuit of happiness - and such a spirit of togetherness on the part of myself and the people I was with - you know who you are - a few of us went to Sam Wo's and ate at Edsel Fong Ford's \"Table No. 8\" and I rode through Chinatown lying down in the bed of your truck while you tried to locate the restaurant and a spot to park. I can see stars and facades of the oriental architecture festooned for New Year celebration.\n\nBefore the show, I criss crossed the stairs outside with the other ticket holders to the glassed in lobby of Brooks Hall. \n\nI was stunned by the complete lack of interference when I saw some folks w/o tickets standing just outside and casually strolled up to an exit-door. I open the door and casually strolled away while a few Lucky ones made it inside free. But, I felt bad, because then, all of the sudden whoever had been assigned to those doors appeared and felt obligated to make an attempt to catch the few I'd let in. 5 or more blue coats running - funny sight. \n\nA good start - but not a great show. I streamed it yesterday and noticed the missing drumming segment and cuts in \"Eyes\". Also absent here, is the encore, \"U.S. Blues\". \n\nIn some notes, I observed \"Get Back\" in the first set, and called the second set opener \"unknown?\", it was \"When Push Comes To Shove\". I wrote, \"Your Afraid Of Love\". \n\nWhile my notes about the show do not describe any space jams, they do mention \"Olatunji and friend\", and I remember the segment as very lengthy - 20 to 40 minutes.\n\nI noted this \"Sounded Good, 'specially\" along with these titles:\n \nYour Afraid of Love\nBlack Peter\nSampson\nMust Have Been The Roses\nWalkin Blues\nDrums\nSpoonful\nUS Blues\n\nI don't think I was being nice\n\n\nScanning your inputs beneath this one I detect a note of meanness about this show, but while I don't rave about much either, I disagree with the harshest of the critics, even Garcia! \n\nIf one is to believe the remark he is said to have hollered back after the first set, \"It Sucked\", then one can assume he determined to play better, second set.\n\nI don't have a ranking system yet, but I'll give it three stars, knowing what shows might someday be recalled as worse, and that the band did play much better than they did on this night.",

      "review_text": "Don't be shy.... Lots of negative reviews on this one.  I am actually quite fond of this show....I think it is more coherent then a lot of the reviews make it out to be.   Weir definitely has some vocal issues--but it always sounds like the other band members always step it up in those moments---All Over Now is a great example--listen to Jerry and Brent hold it down tight while Weir stumbles---good example of teamwork throughout the show---good effort--good show--first set is just downright fun--they are talking--Jerry cracks some comment about something/someone having AIDS and Weir follows with some comment about \"going queer\"--they are doing a lot of talking between songs---fun listen.",

      "review_text": "Maybe too much too fast Very psychedelic show. The sound was not their usual set up It had a very bright Punch and I recall about four cabinets set on the floor opposite the arena from stage.\nSmarcus your worst is my bing, this show is the epiphany of what a special dead show is. I agree that some stretches are trying but thats what makes it unique. This after a few plays has direction but also is fresh. Mick and Bill were on from the get It was Chinese New year of the Hare. Kung Fat Choy! Jerry cracking back at the fanatic?Thats where your wrong. when was G being negative some dude yelling shit at him all the time. If you wanted him to play a certain song and by yelling out Hey LOOSE LUCY JERRY! never happened ever. The band was drunk and high, why should they apologize?",

      "review_text": "A little to harsh Before I discovered Dozin.com I had to rummage through my boxes of old Dead tapes to find the ones I wanted. Now that's over, so thank you.\n\nAs far as this show, this was always one that I picked. Say what you want about the bands very obvious state of intoxication, (I think in early 87 Old Jerry's favorite was Valium. Someone correct me if I am wrong.)but that is irrelevant. Are shows like this not the reason we love the Dead and loved being at the shows? Would the Dead have been the dead if every show was the same. Same songs, played and sang the same way every time? You never knew what you were going to get with the dead and that's what made them so wonderful. Jerry knowingly or not made the ultimate sacrifice for us every night. \n\nYes we can all look back to the shows that smoked from 70's that IMO are not the best years due to the horrific wailing of dirty barefoot Donna who has put an absolute taint on that whole decade that otherwise would have been hands down the boy's best decade by a mile. Or we can look at the red hot summer tour of 89 or a few shinning moments in the fall 93 tour and say \"now that is the way its done\" Not me guys I pick the dog day's in the mid 80's where years of abuse have really began to catch up with Jerry. His playing in 84,85 and most of 86 is raw,dark and heavy. His voice is cracked, weathered and somber. I have never since Jerry every heard any one's voice take on the changes that Jerry's did. First noticed for me in 80,81 ish. He went from the little kid trying to sing from 65 till about then. After the coma we got the voice of Jerry that is most recognized. The old uncle Jerry voice. \n\nSome of you mentioned that the certain members of the band carried others during this show. That is true and that's what the boys did. Of course Jerry was always the foundation of the band but Brent was the glue that held the whole thing together. Once he was gone that glue began to dry up and as we all know the end was near.\n\nI first saw the dead in 90 so I got 5 years of going to shows and I feel blessed every day to have had those years. I was not and hippie, I never wore birkenstocks and tie-dye's but just the same from the first time I saw and heard Jerry my life was changed forever. My only regret is that Jerry came into my life during a time when I didn't need him like I do today. But I have memories as all of you do. I think about him every day still now as you do. I miss him terribly as all of you do. Has any other person (that you have never actually met) every had as big an impact on your lives than Jerry had? Not for me. I have been playing guitar for 20 years now and none of that would have happened if it weren't for Jerry. The first lick's I ever learned were from Eye's and Mingle wood. \n\nYou could see in Jerry's eyes his soulful heart that was speaking only to you. So listen again to this show and re-think it before you dismiss it as junk. Evey single show had something special to offer, even this one. My last show was on 6-22-95. I left that show with a different feeling than any other. I didn't know what it was. I couldn't put my finger on it. I was sad but I never thought it would end. And when I got the new a little over a month later when my buddy called me and all he said to me was \"It's all over man\" I knew that my life would never be the same. Jerry changed us all and shows like this are the reason. I would not have wanted 1-28-87 to go any other way. \n\nSo for me 5 stars, just like every single show they ever played.  \n\nSorry this was so long. Its only my first review and I promise all my others will be much shorter.  Thanks for reading everyone. \n\nPeace",

      "review_text": "Agreeing & disagreeing forgettable, but I was there! Where to start? I was there but it was so forgettable that I had to use several means of deductive reasoning (since most of my analog tapes are either in storage or for some of these middle period shows are missing from my collection of the ~211 attended shows) to determine that among these Chinese New Year's (Gung Ho Fat Choy) and the following shows at Mardi Gras, if I wasn't not confusing with the previous and subsequent years as to whether I was actually there or not? Well I'm sure I was, but it is very strange to me that I can hardly remember \"Get Back\" since not only will something rare make me appreciate the show! So much so, that much later when I was trying to quit seeing Grateful Dead because they were so stubborn in refusing to play anything but the same stuff until eventually they started to diversify more (even though when one compares to like Pink Floyd for example, who mostly played the exact same songs at most every show, Grateful Dead were very diverse.) I very clearly remember when they played \"Revolution\" at one of those before New Year's (I believe I have to check the date?) shows at the Civic in 83? And upon listening to this, albeit perhaps a bit \"harsh\" vocally as some of you folks said (perhaps the key?) I thought the \"Get Back\" alone was pretty good especially Brent on keyboards. But I do commend the few of you who were actually there, since not only do I rarely ever review a show that I wasn't actually at, unlike these ignorant jokers who not only weren't there but no matter what they do is wonderful! So in my humble opinion it wasn't \"Get Back\" that was so bad about his show rather, mostly the very numerous lyric flubs in many tunes and also the extremely boring short second set song list, even though Olatunji was there!\n     Now I have been known for two things, one back during the shows themselves, to be a very harsh critic yet I distinctly remember one time after a Greek show telling someone who was hard on me for being so, of how I could so greatly acknowledge how absolutely amazing that particular show was, so in this sense it is great to see that some others can see that sometimes the band can suck! On the other hand, I agree with that guy (in principle) who was saying something about how Grateful Dead weren't perfect when we say them! (The way I describe this same concept is as follows) unlike a band like for example again Pink Floyd, E.L.P., or Genesis that is, when one would see them live (all of which I did several times each) that even though they did do some improvisation they were so structured that if they made a mistake one would be hard pressed to notice it, and yet even though Grateful Dead often made mistakes they took the risk such that when it was magic it really was magic, if nowhere else nightly in the Percussion and Improvisation (which as I've said elsewhere I refuse to call \"Space\" since there is no air in space) sections!\n     Secondly, I've also been known to inject from time to time my personal experiences, but unlike some folks here I try to use them in a limited sort of way that has some direct bearing on something about the show in question like historical context or as I do here in relation to other shows I've seen; so in this light as I said above if something slightly unusual happened I usually remember it, be it a song or a guest or something else, so again it is surprising to me that I can hardly remember Olatunji being there? I do remember that I'd seen him more than once with Grateful Dead and this must have been it since I remember for obvious reasons most distinctly, when I saw him open at the New Year's 91-92 show since I had a backstage pass and since he was blind when I was walking along with him and his guide when he was talking to me he held my hand! Nevertheless, I pretty well remember most if not all the times I saw other such guests such as Airto (and sometimes) Flora Purim, Branford Marsalis etc., since not to brag, but I saw nearly every appearance that each of these artists guested with Grateful Dead!\n     Furthermore, I not only firmly agree (even though I wasn't there) that 73-11-11 was one of the all time absolute greatest shows ever, but for those with all due respect, gel brains that think some of these performances were so terrific like with \"Fernario\" (I mean I had to listen to this Fernario over and over again and it still did nothing for me) for example I would kindly and strongly urge them to check out for example 77-6-4 (even though the guy said \"in this decade\"). Moreover, similarly for \"Row Jimmy\" 79-12-28 (and for the entire show of 79-12-28 as well) or in the case of \"Shakedown Street\" how about 79-11-25 or numerous others like perhaps 81-9-12 (and again this entire show)!\n     I hate to be a know it all but trust me I do know what I'm talking about even when it comes to shows like this one for which I can hardly remember! So if it wasn't for my enjoying \"Get Back\" that I can't give this a 1, thus a 2!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

Nobody ever pitch-corrected it. \n\nHealy did plenty of petty vandalism throughout the 1st set, running Bobby's vocals through whatever cheezy processor.
