Undisirregardless of what the unknowing say, this is a beautiful recording from a key year in which not many tapes are available. Is it mildly over-saturated in points? God Yes. Is it absolutely driving, pulsating music? Undoubtably! Is the bass audible? Extremely! Are Pig's vocals right up front? Indubidably! Is Jerry as sweet as sweet can be? Yuppers! Get it. Ignore the doubters and the ignorant. Some of you spoiled kids really need to develop an appreciation for what used to be available out there. How else can you make a value judgement on sound quality when you all doubt something that would have been an A- as a harsh judgement just a few years ago. Know of what you speak or shut the hell up. And who really cares if it is studio or live? It is new 67 Dead kids. You little rats who live with the impression that 86 Dead was the best really shouldn't be allowed to comment.

This was almost 40 years ago, recorded w/equipment that wasn't even on the 'drawing board', yet; this is simply a 'good' tape reproduction of the 'house sound', which is completely different type of sound reinforcement and it always suffers somewhat in a recording.  \nFor what it is, this is NOT a bad reproduction of a show that, in reality, is simply a 'memory' in the 'minds' of those who were at the show.\nI say, 'thank God, we at least have this one; shows going back this far, are few and far between for 'tape memories'.

Smokestack slips into the slower King Bee, which has the feel of Hendrix' Voodoo Child. Man, oh, man.\n\nThere are plenty of other goodies in the 11/19/66 Fillmore show. Could have been a Dick's Pick, IMO. The version I linked to has a great Dancing in the Streets, which is missing in the other 2 versions here at Archive. Do yourself a favor and check out the whole show. \n\nThe sound quality really is quite good, not only for a 42-year-old show, but for shows here at Archive. Certainly beats any audience tape.",
