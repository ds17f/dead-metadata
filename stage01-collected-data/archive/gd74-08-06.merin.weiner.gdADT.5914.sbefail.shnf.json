I always loved it because it's just a great show, vibe wise. A pretty good audience recording that really gives the feel of what it was like to be at a Dead show back then. Perfect example is the Uncle John's band with a little reggae groove at the beginning, the crowd clapping and cheering in time ... My favorite part of the show. Whoever posted this show THANK YOU!",

But this is a pretty awful recording, due to age, whatever the case.  I DON'T recommend downloading this, it's very hissy and poppy and it's just basically very bad.  You can hear the individual instruments pretty well which just goes to show how the Wall of Sound could shine through even the poorest of recordings.  The best of this show was released on DP31.  This was a great show, perhaps not as great as 8/4 or 8/5 so you're really not missing much if you haven't heard what isn't on DP31.  The most interesting part of this recording is listening to all the rowdy Jersey City fans screaming out requests for \"CASEY JONES!\" and \"UNCLE JOHN'S BAND!\"  When you read the liner notes of DP31, this exact syndrome is described and it is said to be a contributing factor in why the band quit touring for almost 2 years.  They only played Jersey City once more after this, almost 2 years to the day after this concert.  The recording of that show is better than this.",

I think the very beginning of the first track is pretty screwy, which may be the cause of some of the confusion, but to say that the rest of this recording is poor is WAY off.  There's some kind of phasing sound, probably from the original tape, but it sounds pretty clear for a AUD.  The circulating SBD is one of the best sounding Dead SBDs ever, so if you can get your hands on it, go for it.  But in the meantime, this recording is pretty good.  Unless you just plain don't like AUD recordings, this is far from a waste of time and plastic.",

It takes me back to the years I spent \"in the business\", as a lighting designer, and yes, kiddies, there was hiss and pop at the shows.

Yes, it made us techies shriek and stamp our haurachi's, gnash at our Space Food Sticks and put wrinkles on our faces. So be it. Trying to conjure digital from analog is a bit schizophrenic, no? Sit back and enjoy your Daddy's ride. It's a rare treat and if your try really hard, or not at all, you can dig the vibe as it was put down. I wouldn't trade these gems for anything. Smoke 'em if you got 'em...\n\nOh yea. This great show was recorded on my 20th birthday and I got to hear it a couple of months, not weeks, later.

      "review_text": "Another '74 marathon 1st Set: \"Bertha\" mid-tempo but Garcia's grinding cutter guitar solo pleases. Nothing special about 'Mexicali' but good time fun...rather Jerry's carrying a strong line of tonal pleasures - at this point the polka wasn't as pointed as 80's arena versions...breezy yet skippable 'Don't Ease' Jerry's instrument is on so far...or it sounds real nice. Band ain't together on a nine or ten beat \"Beat.\" Same commentary as before. Alright, my first 'Sugaree' since listening to the string of 07-31 through tonight. For any pretentious enough to create a lovemaking disc - I recommend the song for those soft, slinky evenings. As for the version, it's the song...nothing else but there on a 3 1/2 star plain so it's good listening. Of course we can't have a night without \"Jack\" it's better than 8/5, not as 8/4. Crowd's clapping along. Oh goodness, it's early for the first \"Eyes\" of the past three nights. And it's twenty minutes - they're breaking the mold tonight. Phil does some lovely work six-seven minutes in (I've got no timer - so it's all approximatin) The last few minutes are quite intricately involving - but it's not a definitive version...in fact I may like 7-31's better. The tune appears to end abruptly - Bobby says something about ??? and they go into a breezy, just fine \"Promised.\" \"Deal's\" arranged well to be a stomper - it's good ol' GD. The second epic of the first set (here's bettin the second's lackluster on that front) \"Playin\" the song's not as strong as 8-4 but the jam quizzically probes...Jerry and Phil are in line with each other. I wish they would have continued to funk shit up around the seventeen minute mark like Jerry did with Restoration near the end of the decade. I'm not certain if 'Playin' remains unfinished or if it genuinely segues into 'Scarlet' If it is indeed the later, kudos as it's something rarified. There's something simplistically friendly/becoming/amiable/swingin about its beat that pleases. Donna's welcomingly active mid-way. Not filled with depth but enjoyable. We're all together enjoyin this novel experience as \"Playin\" (they extend the end by a good fifteen seconds so Dionyseus won't leave the Roosevelt.) returns to wrap up a very satisfying first set. No way they could top this.\n\n2nd Set: People appear overwhelmed with kindness for the \"UJB\" opener. The perfect call - hopefully 'Seastones' didn't disturb the mindset. It wanders out into an uncertain forest - but do stay for the song. The rest of the show was discluded from the the DP #31 release...any reason why - let's see... Shit, some people are as ecstatic as me to hear \"Black Peter.\" Were all the rules thrown out tonight? It's slow-burnin. Steady drummin and Keith's present, but the guitars and Jerr's voice lack energy. \"El Paso\" is nice - Bob then remarks that because the temperature keeps changing they need to tune up - once more. Some obnoxious young men are calling for St. Stephen even if they haven't played it in 18 months. Well, from the wise and well-educated to the slutty, \"Loose Lucy.\" Pretty standard and a little sloppy. The \"Big River\" follows is like the others in the past week - hard-charging rock boogie. It's fine. \"Ship\" is nothing outstanding save some nice harmonies near the end. \"Uncle\" is decent and goes down easily. \"Row's\" a little dull as it develops its playfulness in later years. \"Sugar\" makes the crowd happy - is the show over? It's more contemplative than ecstatic. It's molds together jazzily - rather idisyncratic, hmmm... show ain't ending a repeat of \"He's Gone\" Simple execution equals success - campfire breakdown. Time for \"Truckin\" light and jazzy - in fact the sound of the second set closer resembles '73...Jerry's recovered the strength of his guitar. We're back aboard after unnecessary 'Paso to Jimmy.' It wants to celebrate the nighttime as it loses all drums shortly afterwards. The \"Spanish Jam\" remains compelling but won't fright you out of your socks. It seamlessly blends into \"TOO\" that completes the previous night's tease. One must imagine they're tired as it's not really exploding. Things get a little demented after the first verse...but it feels more concilliatory as the band too quickly blows their load. \"GDTRFB\" stumbles into a mild-mannered clap-along. \"Sunshine\" appropriately ends the set on a high note. Jerry thanks the crowd and strongly asserts that they're too much. The perfunctory cheery US Blues\" follows. \n\nWell, I see why the second set was barely included on the D release as it's lacking steam. \n\n3 1/2 stars",

This whole concert is fantastic, but I really want to say that this eyes of the world is the best I've ever heard, and for once it's NOT because of the jam after the song (in fact, it's a little too long for my taste, especially since it never goes anywhere, it just sort of dies out at the end). The two solos jerry takes in between the three verses are mind-blowing. I have never heard him play like that in ANY eyes ever; so fast, so beautifully phrased, so inspired. The AUD on this one is a treasure because you can hear the crowd freaking out as the solos expand and the tension builds... although it should be noted that the soundboard of this, the playing -> scarlet -> playing and uncle john's band cuts are on dick's picks volume 31, so anyone who likes the version on this AUD ought to check that release out (the whole pick is dynamite from beginning to end and has a lot of the 8/4 and 8/5 shows as well).\n\nENJOY!",

After the show, we found that every third or fourth car had it's window broken and it's tape player missing. A memorable week for a 17-year-old Dead Head.\n\nAbout the quality of this recording: I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Thanks to this archive and the likes of Charlie Miller, we are spoiled. Sound quality wise. Back in the day, when we collected tapes (cassettes), sound quality was important, but getting the performances (relatively) uncut was just as, if not more, important. And MOST important of all was getting songs not available on vinyl - like a live performance of Doin' That Rag into The Seven into Good Lovin' (into Saint Stephen into The Eleven). Of course those of you in the know, know I am referring to the amazing concert right here in New York City, on September 29, 1969 at the Cafe au Go-Go. But there are many more examples. So let's travel back in time 38 years, and then we'll leap even further back.\n\n        It's 1974, you're 17 years old and you've quietly entered the house. It's the wee hours of the morning, and the rest of the family are asleep.

So if that (DP) is the SBD that others are on about, I don't understand them.\n\nThe DP version, like many but not all DP/RT/SBD, is too quiet in the vocals and Bob's guitar.  This AUD has better balance.   But more than that, it is far more FUN.   The crowd really adds to the feel, and in all the right places.   During the great guitar jams and solos you are hardly aware of the crowd, but when it is time to applause ... YeeeHa..",

I usually find that, tho' the later shows are great by the standards of any other band, there is something in the earlier shows that's over and above. It's that excitement of: we don't know what's going to happen - anything could happen and we're open to giving it a chance - and who the hell cares anyway, because we're doing it, we're in it NOW. It's timeless, and other concerns just melt away while you're in the music.\n\nThis show has that. Just listen to \"Eyes of the World\" - that's what it's all about!!\n\nAnd, oh yes, if all the AUD's were like this I'd listen to them more.",

Dick, as good as he was, screwed up again by playing Archive God and meshing three shows three shows together at his whim (August 4,5 & 6, 1974), rather than being the purist he should've been and IMHO providing us with this entire concert.\n\nThis is by any measure a very good to excellent audience tape (the vocal mix is off in a strange way at times, example GDTRFB), although when push comes to shove I prefer one of Healey's Matrix tapes Seriously, who doesn't?? If you don't know what I'm referring to check out Dane County Coliseum, 2/15/73. Also, while Dick can be faulted for combining shows, the quality of his masters cannot be denied.\n\nHigh points of the Wall of Sound show (evidenced by the staggering clarity and definition of Phil's bass) are many, including a classic rendering of Eyes of the World (Jerry's energy and Phil's relentlessness. The band is in perfect synch!); a scintillating combo of Playing-Scarlet-Playing (a 36 min audio orgasm of epic proportions, and the seven song stretch from Sugar Magnolia through Sugar Mad redux is spectacular. Drums and Space are built into The Other One jam and this entire 60 minute segment is quintessential Dead -- a veritable microcosm of who they are and what they stand for. Just so damn good that it defies words, though I have tried...\n\nFinally, this is the official kick ass monumental archive, c'mon guys, break the song lists down by sets. Not to have done so is silly, lay and in my opinion a major oversight by an otherwise dedicated and loyal group of individuals who made it possible in the first place. It has become a major disappointment for me personally for obvious reasons. Still, the positives overshadow any shortcomings in presentation. Kudos to universal access!",

Every single band member is on fire and at the height of their powers.  Jerry seems to give the vocals a little something extra on this night.  I love how he tells the crowd at the end, \"you guys are too much.\"  Classic.\nBy the way, ignore what anyone complaining about the quality of this AUD recording has to say.  This is a fantastic recording with each instrument very evenly balanced and present in the mix.  The matrix of this show is excellent as well, with the best of both SBD and AUD recordings.  I actually prefer the AUD to the SBD due to the superior balance and presence between/among all instruments and vocals that is lacking somewhat on DP31.",

Bobby came out and said the speakers were getting wet and they had to postpone.  A riot ensued.  My 13 year old eyes saw some crazy stuff.. bottles flying, bikers beating, naked guys slithering across my feet in the mud covered with broken glass...Came back on the 6th, but the VW threw a rod on the way and we had to get a new ride, got there just as Bertha was starting.  Bobby informed us all about Nixon's resignation.  Then some great music.  The Eyes was cut short before China Doll due to some idiots climbing the fence right in front of the stage while people flung bottles at them.  The Playin' was sure different from the one in Philly 2 nights earlier.  Ned and Phil was not announced and it just confused some people, i had heard it the day before, but full bore was something!  On and on they played... someone hit Bobby's guitar neck with a glow stick in Truckin (you can hear a little hiccup in his singing).  After the show they set off fireworks that just about set the old place on fire.  The crowd made a quick exit amid the smoke and sparks, the whole place was wood!  I actually wrote to Dick Latvala way back begging for this release, he wrote back telling me that Reel 3 was missing from the vault, apparently they found it, thank god.  This combined with 8/4/74 in Philly are about 8 hours of my favorite GD music for the ages.",

There are so many highlights, but I hear it as consistently inspired from Bertha through Row Jimmy and the best I've heard from 74 so far. What's amazing to me is how tight, creative and juicy songs like Don't Ease Me In are. It's like they could have played Day Job (with aid of a time machine) and I would say this song is killer.\nAs another reviewer mentioned, Big River was played alot during this period, and yet I don't hear it as yet another Big River.

Dick's 31 has the highest of the highlights from Set One and the beginning of Set Two, but every single song in the first set has that extra oomph, that focus, that gets you up dancing and lets you know they came to PLAY!  The second set features more slow songs and some space jamming in Truckin', but the band maintains their energy throughout, as when the faster parts come along, they are right on point.  Jerry especially adds hot licks to every song.  \n\nThis show is another argument for why 11/73 - 10/74 is the single greatest 12-month period in Dead history.  It seems to me the band turned up the urgency in '74 as compared to the more laid-back, patient, and often spacey feel of '73.  There are faster tempos, such as Sugaree which is played at an 80's tempo, and the band delivers some of its most energetic and creative playing, with everyone contributing.  Also, this is the year for audience recordings, with the Wall of Sound fully in effect.  The audience clapping along to Sugar Magnolia and the banter between songs adds to the feeling of being there.  \n\nOnly quibble is that Bob's guitar is a bit low in the mix.  Also, I'm not sure if it's in the recording or just my old speakers not being able to handle full-on Phil, but there is definitely some bass buzz at times.  Otherwise, the sound is pristine.  Definitely download and decode the files for the best sound (someone just turned me on to Trader's Little Helper which is an easy way to decode files in multiple compression formats including FLAC and Shorten).
