They would be the Hartford and Worchester shows and this show. \n\nSadly I feel I went to one show too many that tour, this show. \n\nI won't argue that the set list is not damn good.  And for that matter I'm sure playing was top notch too.\n\nThe thing is, the Meadowlands is just a slightly better venue than Hell for me.  After being on my home turf for Hartford and the pleasant New England vibe of Worchester, the Meadowlands location and Nazi security put me in a bad mood before the show even started. \n\nI was aware of the cool songs being played but my mind was distracted by the drive back to New Haven I knew I had to do and in retrospect the travesty taking place in Las Vegas that night (Ray Leonard \"beating\" Marvin Hagler) added a post-script of ill will to that whole night.\n\nThat being said, I'm looking forward to listening to this show to see what I missed, especially Terrapin>Other One.",

      "review_text": "Decent, but by no means an all-star night. 1st Set: So, it's the final \"Dancin...,\" huh? Undeniably a surprise... this version is good-time chill but the vocals are thin, and the outro jam's ambition is non-existant. \"Franklin\"'s is well-played but again rather abrupt and lacks that dynamic construct. Jerry provides the inspiration for a standard \"Rooster.\" \"Peggy\" has a comforting stroll. \"Uncle\"'s got an assertive backbeat, wish there was more spitfire in the vocals. \"Mexicali\" is professional, tho to Weire' credit, his rhythm is sounding crisp. \"Push\" is 'Push.' Blah. \"Jack\" promises some power and they deliver; Jerry's casacading climactic drive is wonderful. \"Deal\" segues in on a high, but only continues in standard fashion. \n\n2nd Set: \"Stranger,\" uh-oh...I sense a '1st set songs thrown in 2nd set' feel tonight. Ideally these songs would be extended cause they're being reserved for the meat of the gig. Too bad these ideals are rarely realized. \"Stranger\" is muted, \"Cumberland\" is sung without urgency and the music's bland. Yay, \"Tons...\" ehhhh... Wow, a \"Saint\" too... Geez, they are determined to shush up this Meadowlands crowd. Face it, 'Saint' always opens awkwardly when not preceded by a 'Sailor.' There's some tense Jerry work building to the climax that Bobby kills by mistiming most of his yelps. After the requisite \"Drums/Space,\"  we're treated to a weakly sung \"Terrapin,\" tho Mydland injects some intensity with his synths...This \"OO\" is rather jazzy but doesn't deviate far from the theme. \"Stella\"'s quite a fine version. \"Sugar\" is run of the mill, but the residue from \"Stella\" brings me to tears when Jerry chooses to encore with \"Black Muddy.\" Just an incredible reservoir of warmth and humanity in those scracthy pipes of that cherubic man. \n\nMore of a 2 1/2 than three... But I've been told people will like you more if you slightly inflate what their fair grade should be.",

Jerry was dynamic for being in a coma within the last year. Remember it's said that he had to re-learn the strings. Doing it all that fast is F**kin' awesome. I know people that have been playin the dead for 25 years and aren't as good as Capt. Tripps this day. So download it if you like Good music. I really can't stand the negativity people throw in these reviews because they like the Pig-Pen era or the sound of Keith. Both Great but Brent added the thunder behind the storm and if you pay attention to the music he did a great job.

Was it his best show of the year?   No,any head w/ half a brain and some taste knows that the best show of 87 was msg 9-18-87, by a landslide.   But the jack straw axe work in this show is proof that jerry still had it well into the 80's - and the deal that followed was sick as well.  Unfortunately, their momentum was not sustained going into the second set, and they had to re-build, and did catch heat out of space w/ a pretty tight terrapin>other one.   Overall, a very solid show, with a few amazing highlights.  it wasnt one of those smoking shows from start to finish, but if they smoked every night, we wouldnt appreciate the band as much.   I always appreciated nights when jerry stunk but was trying.",

The dead are what they are- if you choose to just like one year of music then fine- why are you even on the 1987 area anyway? \n\nComments like yours insult the very cerebral discussion of music and the evolution of the dead, like other bands over time- thankfully we had time to enjoy it-soundd like you wasted yoru time and never 'got' it and now have an axe to grind.

It seems like we all have had similar experiences and that any night could have held special meaning to us. What is it about the Dead, even on a bad night, there was a moment that struck a nerve ? The silence between notes, a simple riff, maybe the lights.\n    One of my most memorable was an 87 MSG show. I'd had the worst day of my young life, dragged my wife to Chinatown and bitched for the first set, subjecting her to an hours worth of pity, ignoring the time. When I fully vented, we cabbed it up and got in during second set.  the first few notes of Fire on the Mountain. Second level, the dancers were ringing the walkway and the whole arena was lit in an indigo. It was warm, September, I felt the sweat and excitement.  Like being in the womb. Nothing mattered, no cares. How frivolous it is to dwell on my own little misery, I thought, how selfish. And this is as close to heaven as I will come in a crowd. Everyone was of the same mind, with that deep blue neon light bathing us, and those SOUNDS. It can't be described, especially by a semi literate like myself, but there was feeling that soaked into us, that soothed, a state of grace. All is human, every flaw and misdeed forgiven, what we share far exceeds our differences. Love. \n    I'm interested to know your stories. Have you all felt this at one time or another, with or without psychedelics?",

I remember watching them start Terrapin out of nowhere after Space and just enjoyed the hell out of it. Listen guys, I grew up in Paterson ten miles away from the Byrne Arena, and the trick to dealing with Jersey Meathead security is you gotta tell them TO FUCK OFF, with authority, and they will. Learn to box, be ready to throw down and they fold like a tent every time. These bullies prey on the weak, and they smell blood. Security does not mean obedience .
