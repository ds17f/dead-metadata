She even admitted - and everyone in the band knew this - she cannot sing on stage.  She was passable in the studio but had severe pitch problems live, Garcia said so, Weir said so, Lesh said so, even Donna said so.  We had to suffer through that era as fans, I saw only 30 or 40 shows when Donna was in the band out of the 330-plus shows I saw, most were between '79-'85, first was in '72.  But man was she awful live.  I rememebr one show in '77 at the Palladium in NYC we had people covering their ears she was screeching so horribly.  Weir said Brent was by far the best vocalist they had and that his singing was horribly missed when he OD'd.  I agree with Weir.\n\nThis is the best recording of this show, the one we've liked since the foot locker auction in the late-'80's.\n\nSorry kid, you're the idiot...I forgot more about this band than you will ever know..hundreds of live shows starting in '72...and yes learn what the actual band members say.

I saw a little over 400 shows from '70 to '91, only 10-12 after 1988.  I saw around 130 with Donna, and she was absolutely horrible live.  You kids weren't there so you don't know, all you have are \"reputations\" of shows and the twisted lore started by the online community the last 15 years., and that isn't reality.  I saw 25 shows in 1977, including this one.  This was a great, great show but not the end all/be all it is made out to be.  My favorite May shows were Buffalo and Chicago, the June Winterland run was great, but I liked the Fall '77 shows better actually.  Garcia had the Wolf back on the road and the band was really rolling.  Englishtown is probably my favorite of the year I attended.  Kids - please grow up and stop harping on people just because they think Donna sucked on stage.  She did, even the band thought so.  She was a studio singer not a stage singer, [plain and simple.  People went back to the shows because Garcia was amazing before he got strung on heroin. Saying someone is not bright because they kept going to shows even though Donna sucked is a completely idiotic comment.

      "review_text": "The oneness <br />Talking about this show is like talking about the Beatles - you can't say anything new. That barn door was closed by the early 2000s. When this SBD hit the B&P lists in the late '80s, it was traded in clear, punchy low-gen. Because Phil was mostly lost on so many high-gen AUDs, on C90 this boomy SBD was a revelation, and was many heads' first clear peek at the year (the Moore AUD was common until the '90s). The show was great by provenance. Thus, instant legend - spoken of with hushed tones, reverence, religious fervor, anger, repulsion. I first heard the Betty in the lots - it  didn't circulate out as quick as you'd think.  Worth noting: this was a small-school, student council gig for the kids, in their gym - not a big NYC appearance, with no posterity expectations.  \n\nThis show towering larger than life, and Deadheads being one-percenters, iconoclasts, bohemians, and non-conformists whose nature sidesteps critical consensus, there will be detractors for the sake of it (or we can just call them whiners...). Still, objectively - now that we have the whole tour in pristine gens - we can see that this show was matched/surpassed by others of the tour/year. It's still a must-hear if not a must-own (admittedly I revisit every few years). In reality, there IS NO best-ever Dead show. It would be sad if, out of over 2000 shows, only one was great! But there ARE a top 30, and this is one. It would be top 20 but truthfully the second set is not the tour's best. The strength is the overall flow and cohesive feel.\n\nFirst Set. Jer starts like he's been playing for an hour already on <i>Minglewood</i> (on the official, the first 11sec are from 4/25) and the drummers are money on <i>Loser. TLEO</i> is always welcome but it's not the month's best. On <i>Jack Straw</i> Jer is all over the place behind Bobby's verses - it's a cut above in detail. <i>Deal</i> is  way uptempo and jaw-dropping; listen to Bobby and Keith. On the official release, <i>Lazy Lightning</i> has an edit @3:09, cutting 2 iterations of \"my lightning too\". Then, for the first 16sec of <i>Supplication</i> it uses 5/22. <i>Brown Eyed</i> has a great tempo, Bobby's best performance, and Billy uses a late-70s four on the floor (some will love, some not). Bobby teases Good Lovin' but Jer starts <i>Row Jimmy</i>, whipping a wild slide solo and Donna is great. The <i>Dancin'</i> is famous...and not the tour's best.\n\nSecond Set.  Keith plays <i>The Streets of Cairo</i> during \"Take a Step Back\", though it is missing from some sources and strangely edited on the official. <i>Scarlet</i> is the only average song of the show; kind of mellow, it's still a nice 26min ScarFire, and the last couple minutes are good, but not a tour best. They're back on track for <i>Estimated</i> - a great '77. <i>St. Stephen</i> is average for '77 but <i>Not Fade</i> is incredible. Usually downtempo means draggy, but sometimes it means plunked right into the groove, sittin' square and rounding all the corners like a favorite couch. It has one of Jer's longest continuous eruptions ever. The Stephen>NFA sandwich with Dew is over 37min. The latter's not the tightest of the 3 on tour at first (4/27 is better, 5/22 excellent). Likewise <i>One More Saturday</i> is good yet not 4/30, 5/21, or 5/28.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall = 5 stars\n\nHighlights:\nNew Minglewood Blues - out t'gate brilliance\nLoser - in the pocket\nJack Straw - Jer is all over the galaxy\nDeal   - jaw-dropping; fetch a bandage\nBrown Eyed Women -  great tempo, Billy beats & Bobby brilliance\nRow Jimmy - crazy Jer slide solo\nEstimated Prophet - great '77   \nNot Fade Away - groovy & injurious; big & potent\n\nThe Holy Trilogy:\n5/7/77 - B+  \u00a0\u00a0A few more high points; less flowing\n5/8/77 - A-  \u00a0\u00a0Most consistent show; best flow; fewer highest points\n5/9/77 - A-  \u00a0\u00a0Least consistent but biggest high points\n\nSOURCES: The best SBD is the cantor_sacks_266. Though still boomy (Barton SBDs have extreme low end that washes up to the mids), it is the least problematic. It's pitch-corrected (unlike some) and patched with the Moore AUD (except Supplication>Brown-Eyed Women). But the patches are rough in places (Lazy Lightning), for which the Hicks SBD is preferred. I have stuck to the seamons matrix. It's thumpy, but has a better image and energy. The dan_35086 matrix is incredible and if you find yourself going back to this show, try rotating it in. It's different than the seamons, fills in missing gaps from the SBD, and creates an image missing from the dry Betty Board - even if he states you can make a viola ;). I would like to call Dan's assemblage and mastering a work of art, because as a tech head it moves me emotionally, but it's a work of fine audio engineering skill. Still, you have to pull all bass freqs wayyy down - though less so in the 24-bit. This would be counter-intuitive (humans can't hear the \"extra 8 bits\"), but there are factors involved with the equipment used and the results are audible (24 bit circuitry has a different path than 16, so there is probably a component factor). Though it is missing some tuning gaps, it has more hall sound whereas other matrices lean toward the SBD. The hicks_4982 SBD has way too much bass and weird track boundaries. Of course, the original Jerry Moore AUD (berger_miller_117027) was outstanding for the era and lends itself to fine matrices; and now we can hear it in low gen. It has the compete LL>Supp and the start of Minglewood, but with some edited/missing tunings. Dancing in the Streets is a bonus on <b>Terrapin</b>. <b>May 77/Get Shown</b> addresses the thumpy low end problem very well, at least overall, and fixes some buzzing. However it edits the tunings (even the \"take a step back\"), which changes the nature, and substitutes patches with sections from 4/25 (<b>30 Trips</b>) & 5/22 (<b>Dick's #3</b>). Between the two matrices and the official is a hard pick, but a little AUD does make the show more exciting and less dry (and a complete source is nice).\n~ ~ ~\nSelfimportantdeadhead - For a list of the hundreds of bands that had both genders, try Google. Maybe you can think of a keyword that substitutes for \"chicks\".\n\nGlynspsa - The key being: <i>You</i> never heard a single person; though there were thousands and though there were trading vectors pre-net that had little preference for the Donna era.  There are dozens of examples of the band at their best in the 78-92 years (as well as band members that preferred the Brent era, and the archivist[s] does choose from this era). The same wide-swath argument is used by curmudgeons that espouse pre-Keith. Wedging all DeadHeads in your box: GLWT. If you have an era <i>preference</i>, MPTY. That's the beauty. \n\n Juanie - Discussing Donna isn't a \"pissing contest\", it's reviewing. Sometime she adds, sometimes she detracts,  sometimes cats leave the neighborhood. It doesn't take  a professional to critique a Donnaskreech any more than shoes-in-dryer, guitars losing intonation in the sun, or Bobby's slide practice - though perhaps a musician's ear. Tempered Donna is likely one of the reasons for this show's vaunted status. Kreutzmann said in his book that, though he likes Donna: \"I never felt she fit...she sang in tune but it was the timbre - like colors clash\". He was wrong about the tuning part, some of the time. Bless him, he doesn't want to lose a friend. \n/my soapbox",

Almost a third of the 350-plus shows I saw included Donna, she had real issues on stage. But it rarely ruined a show. A song, maybe.
