(They play Me and My Uncle 3 times! The very first Uncle was 11/29, also at the Matrix.) This show is almost all blues. Old blues, 50's style blues, psychedelic blues, and go-go blues, like Big Boy Pete (do the twist!). Jerry sounds great singing and playing Death Don't Have No Mercy--the highlight of the show for me. I agree with Ox Fall Down, the Cream Puff War jam is good. The Dancing in the Streets Jam alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nThat said, the set list is a bit repetitive on the blues end, and many of the songs just aren't that good. I've now listened to all but two of the 1966 shows here at Archive.org. This isn't one of the better ones. But it's sure worth listening to, more than once. But do check out  9/16 and 11/19, and 5/19.\n\nAs I noted in another review, the Matrix is now an upscale bar called MatrixFillmore, owned by San Francisco's millionaire mayor, Gavin Newsom. It's the kind of place that wouldn't allow beatniks.",

      "review_text": "Nothing beats '66-'71 Grateful Dead i've been listening to the GD since 1966 (though I stopped going to see them live around 1978 as they just didn't have that \"same old thing\" for me anymore).  Nothing, BUT NOTHING, beats the Grateful Dead from 1966-1971.  They did it all..pop, blues, psychedelia/space/acid rock, rock 'n roll, country, bluegrass..and they did it exceptionally well.  They were at their best and most innovative during this period and because of this really established themselves as an iconic rock group. I especially love their 1966-67 period.  The sheer exhilaration and ecstasy of their work so clearly reflects what we felt then..We really were going to change the world for the better.  Unfortunately, reality struck home or maybe it was the acid just being metabolized out of everyone's system.  Nevertheless, I don't think the Dead ever again reached the artistic or creative heights they achieved during this time period (i.e. '66-'71). They may have made more money, been more professional, honed their recording and instrumental skills to a finer edge, achieved greater fame, attracted more fans in later years, but they were at their best earlier on.  I know a lot of the younger fans will rave on about albums like Blues for Allah, or Mars Hotel, or Terrapin Station, or recall \"remarkable\" concerts in the late '80s or '90s but as far as I'm concerned the GD were never they same after Pig died and went downhill creatively and artistically after that sad event.  They were never the same.  Their music (live and recorded) didn't have the same edge.  Those of you out there who were also privileged to have seen them back in the day know what I'm talking about.  Their concerts/shows also just weren't the same.  When my wife was hit by a flying chair in 1978 I finally realized that the party (and the '60s) were truly over and confined my fix of Grateful Dead music to albums and tapes (released and boots).  Then the internet and sites like this (among others, like Wolfgang's Vault--and don't bitch about paying, sadly the '60s are over, DEAL WITH IT) came about allowing us to once again enjoy the Dead's and other great band's fabulous musical archives",

He would play some pretty rough recordings of live shows, but it made an immediate impact that so I went out and bought a bunch of studio tapes (Workingman's Dead, American Beauty, Touch of Grey). I really got into them throughout college and saw The Other Ones at Great Woods in Mass. Well over the last 20 or so years I went here, there and everything in my music interest. Until recently I hadn't really listened to much Dead until I watched Long Strange Trip on Amazon. That's been a total wake up call for me to rediscover the Dead, and discover anew this early Dead, which is absolutely amazing. I'm so thankful for you and others for sharing these priceless recordings. Cheers",

      "review_text": "Bear of a tape <br />This is a compilation of set fragments that, for reasons of provenance, has circulated under this date. Multiple pitch errors (one of them large) and lesser sound qual make this something you tackle. The Matrix was just a small club in Cow Hollow (owned by Marty Balin; now White Rabbit), and they immediately outgrew its confines. The poster for this run has a bizarre tree-monster-man flinging little creatures at a horse-man-giant who's shitting a pile of them. A flaccid-phallus-holding monkey-man is watching!? Maybe the strangest Dead gig flyer. It's not a clear recording, but regardless of pedigree there are interesting tidbits for the historically-inclined digging into the Dead's first year. \n\nSeveral different dates have been suggested for these show frags, settling on a range from mid-November to early December, and maybe all at The Matrix. At this time Bear would sometimes recycle tapes, even beginning mid-reel.  Confusing the issue, the first M&MU used to circulate as filler, a monkey wrench that suggested it was the lone representation of a single show (it has since stayed in its current position; possibly how it sits on the reel). But the material groups into thirds by pitch and sonic fingerprint. This indicates that the 1st third is not the same show as the final third (and on the third frag you don't hear the applause like on the first frag). The second version of M&MU is not arranged exactly like the first version, suggesting that these frags are more than days apart. Frags 2 & 3 would make no sense as 2 sets, at least in this order. Someone else can figure out the correct sequences, but either tracks 1-7 and 21-26 are one show, and 8 & 9 and 10-20 are one or two other shows; or more likely, 1-9 are a show, as are 10-20, and 21-26. My guess is that this is one Dec show and two from Nov. - i. e., the middle frag is 12/1 and the others late Nov. I say this based on tape analyzation alone and not knowing how things sit in the vault. \n\nAnyway you slice you get frags of 3 shows (even if as little as one song). Curiously, the balance and lack of dynamics are consistent in all parts. Also, Dead. net lists a \"Merry-Go-Round Broke Down tuning after Me & My Uncle\", but doesn't say which M&MU - and it doesn't circulate. Either they are mistaken or they have a tape with more than the circ copy (and the 2nd show was taped over this tuning from the 1st show). They played The Matrix Nov 28>Dec 1 (and had probably played there in Dec '65, their first month, as well). Working on just venue logic, one of these is likely 11/30 and/or 11/28. Other possibilities are one week earlier in Nov, 12/2, or 12/9. This is probably the only Dec '66 stuff we have, except for parts of <b>Vintage Dead</b> and <b>Historic Dead</b> that have been matched to 12/66 (from Avalon Ballroom). \n\n<i>Minglewood Blues</i> is a set opener, apropos the patter. <i>Betty & Dupree</i> is an early Jer warbler and this is the only extant version (barring the studio version \t\ton <b>Rare Cuts</b>). <i>Next Time You See Me</i> isn't yet to where Pig brought it. Rarity <i>See That My Grave is Kept Clean</i> is probably the best of the four we have. <i>Alice D. Millionaire</i> is another one for which this is the only circulating live version. A restarted <i>Me & My Uncle</i> finishes a 35min show frag or set. \n\nYou'll sometimes see this <i>Cream Puff War</i> on lists, though none of this frag can be accurately assessed or assimilated without taming the hyper-helium pitch. You can tell this is from a different show (the next 10 are a sonic match), but notice that Jer says it's the end of a set, so we are missing a bunch here. The song was entering its peak jam potential and this version is more eruptive than 7/16/66 (and a clue arguing for 12/66 for this section).   <i>You Don't Love Me</i> is not as hot as the other one we have (attached to 2/25, but actually from this period). After a <i>Beat it On Down the Line</i>-7 [9 for Pig], Jer gets a big piece of the early arrangement for <i>Hurts Me Too</i>, soloing for over 1min. The arrangement for <i>On the Road Again</i> is different than the one we have from earlier in the year. <i>Look on Yonder Wall</i> is aka \"Get Ready to Meet Your Man\", written by James Clark. Elmore James retitled it and bands of this era discovered it as the B-side to Shake Your Moneymaker. It features an unknown guest. <i>It's My Own Fault</i> is the BB King song, written by John Lee Hooker (the influential Live at the Regal had come out the previous year). This is apparently the only version. The guest is still singing; Jer lays an explosive blues solo. <i>Down So Long</i> is an original that Jer played in the last few months of '66  (it seems to crib \"I Will Turn Your Money Green\" by Furry Lewis and musically follows \"Stealin'\"). Just two circ and though this is the more exciting version, 11/29 has better sound. The next few are solid enough, with <i>Deep Elem</i> tying up a 57min frag (Note Jer saying he is starting a new set, which is then missing but for one). This is the oldest one we have and it's not a very fleshed arrangement, especially the verses.\n\n<i>There is Something On Your Mind</i> is another rarity. Not sure if Pig knew the Big Jay McNeely version or \t\tthe Bobby Marchan, but it's not as good as 11/29.  The opposite is true for rarity <i>Big Boy Pete</i>, and <i>Death Don't Have No Mercy</i> is great. <i>Overseas Stomp</i> is one of 5 versions (plus the studio version bonus track on the 1st album). The song is sexual innuendo, so what does \"when that Washington lands in France\" mean? (I used to think it meant the SS Washington but the song is much older).  In <i>Dancin'</i> Bobby sings \"it's autumn of the year\", as on 11/19, so this may not be from Dec. There is no indication that <i>Me & My Uncle</i>, the end of this 35min frag, is the end of a set/show.   \n\n<u>1st Frag</u>: \u00a0C\n<u>2nd Frag</u>: C+\n<u>3rd Frag</u>: \u00a0C+\nOverall = 2\u00be stars\n\nHighlights:\nBetty & Dupree - historical interest\nSee That My Grave's Kept Clean - historical/best version\nAlice D.

Oh yeah, and Cream Puff War noodles on nicely for nine minutes.\nI give it 4 because 11/29/66 deserves 5 for a better recording and again, these alternate performances don't deviate too much at this point quite yet in their history.
