      "review_text": "You'll find better on the first two days of the run. 1st Set: We're going to hear the rest of \"In the Dark\" tonight, so it's no surprise that we open with an average \"Hell.\" Jerry's leading the charge on a fluid \"Sugaree,\" but the energy gauge is only at a '7.' Somewhat non-existant groove intro for \"Minglewood\" but it still is better than the label, 'good ol' GD.' Yes, it's been awhile since I felt a \"Loser.\" Well-played if not soul-shaking. Finally, \"Tons...\" Skip.  \"Desolation\" is nicely told, rather mellow vibes coming from the band which makes the label 'good ol' GD' not insulting when they step into an easy going, intricate playing \"Big Railroad.\" The crowd's clapping, but the band negligently responds with a barely adequate \"Music\" to stuntingly close out the set.\n\n2nd Set: Tho it's been played since Fall '82, we can't neglect playing \"Touch\" in every city we stop in. SAdly enough, the same could be said for another '82 introductee, \"Man Smart.\" Thank goodness the latter has some life to it. \"Terrapin\" is decent, showing signs that tonight's band can still manufacture a glimpse of raw power. \"Drums\" is standard, but \"Space\" reaches the outer limits of my cerebellum. Some very cool arrangements. \"Truckin\" starts out meekly, finshes decently tho with no outro jam. Sensing that the band's running out of steam, \"Wharf\" makes a nice resting spot. Brent adds some gorgeously lilting harmonies. The predictable twosome emerge as standard of their respective fold, tho \"NFA\" feels more urgent tonight than its last couple of appearances. Yummy, this tape provides the audience clap-along in between the 2nd and the Encore. Wait, the boys are back and help the crowd along with their singalong. \n\"Black\" makes the fifth \"In the Dark\" selection of the evening, thereby completing the Full Album's contents for this hot 'Second City' crowd.  I swear I have no clue when I make these 'setlist' prognostications.\n\nA decent gig, but the least impressive of the three night stand. Put together pieces of 4/9& 4/10 and you have a show worthy of 4 1/4 stars. (which would be my highest rating on this site, so far.) So long :)",

The 1st set highlights for me are definitely Loser and Big RR Blues. The Bucket-Sugaree opener is also well done. Comparing versions to others from 1987, many of these performances stand out, including the Touch of Grey, Terrapin, Wharf Rat, Throwin' Stones, and NFA - even with the bop, bop. \n\nA whole crew of friends from high school came down from Milwaukee for this run, and this was our last hoorah together - this was a very danceable show (and still is).",

It was rainy overcast day in Chicago and the parking lot scene was very very subdued. Alot of people chillin' in their automobiles. Great warm sound that night. It didnt sound as dry as the FM. I turned my friend on to these run of shows and we where totally 'Jelled' that evening.I immediatly had a huge appetite...a good sign. We liked the lst night the best. We had a boom-box plugged into the cigareete lighter in my friends station wagen right on the edge of the parking lot closest to the UIC pavillion. Bob Weir waved to me that day as he was walking into the back door coming out of a van with a beautiful blond haired woman. People said he was dating a local Chicago anchor woman who worked for a network. The cops had the parking lot spied out from a building,some people got busted..downer.We got invited to attend a free meal and Hare Krishna seminar but we declined.Playing is a strong 3 and 4 for quality. I've got my fingers crossed for SBD's from the lst two nights!",

You have to grade 1-5 stars buddy.  Second, your reviews are more a grammatical mystery than a helpful review.  You sit at work, don't pay much attention to the music, go from one song to another every 30 seconds to \"try to get the song vibe\" and then you write these sterile reviews.  You wouldn't know a well played Iko Iko if it came by and stuck itself up your ass.  \n\n1 star for your reviews, and unfortunately this concert will bear the brunt of the criticism towards your reviews.",

Don't know the origin of theirs but this AUD doesn't do the high quality of the original justice.\n\nThis UIC show was incredible. The whole run had a flavor.\nI was in the lot for all three nights. Thought it was a two night run then I see three.\nUIC is southside of Chicago. Hanging out in the lot all night brought out some interesting folks. Avoided car jacking.\nCops were using nightvision telephoto crap and would swoop in when you'd light up anything, even a cigarette. That's how I got my parking place--some dead head (tie-died) told me the previous occupant was busted anbd his car towed.\nPittsburgh shows came soon after, and the police beating up a head got major attention on MTV. Before that occured, I told some young head who was puzzled by their hatin' on 'heads: \"look at that cop\" who was standing in the rain. He wasn't there to make money or recognition or anything. He just did his thing. As Dylan wrote, \"the cops don't need you and they expect the same.\" Don't muck. They in charge. Get over it.\nDespite all that, I got some puffing in. And of course there was the show--the last of three of my favorites.",

      "review_text": "Sorry Guys, This Emperor Has No Clothes I have to say I'm a bit surprised at the glowing reviews for this and the other uploads?  smgarcia and jboyaquar have it just exactly right. This is far and away the weakest of the three nights. My only guess is that these four and five star opinions are being put up by folks who aren't very familiar with anything done in the prime 1970s or early '80s, let alone the experimental years of the 1960s? From Jerry's vocals being \"challenged\" after '82, this evening is a pretty good example of Jerry's poor singing.  \n\nI'd love nothing better than to give this performance four and five stars, being from the \"Windy City,\" but I can't.  I don't review these shows from sentimentality on how good a time I had, or it being my first show, etc. I do it purely on the performance of the group and the quality of the recording. After going through the entire show, I could only pull out Minglewood, Big RXR, and TMNS as keepers, allowing a custom segue mix of the two former to make a nice 19:07.  Other than that, there's nothing here worth mentioning with Jerry sounding so bad.\n\nThe only other edit is adding a heavy dose of upper midrange and treble to brighten this flat pre-FM soundboard. \n\nCome on guys.  Do us all a favor and spin a few shows from the earlier years for comparing what four and five star shows really sound like.  I enjoy the personal stories, but you're not doing [other?] newbies much good with uneducated and idle thoughts on the music. If it wasn't for the three aforementioned songs that were thoroughly enjoyable, this show would have gotten one star.",
