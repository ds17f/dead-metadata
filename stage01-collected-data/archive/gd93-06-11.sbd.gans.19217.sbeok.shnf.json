I told my then girlfriend, now my wife, that I loved her for the first time during Brokedown Palace...she was in front of me, my arms around her rocking back and forth underneath the stars, and I sang into her ear...\"I love you more than words can tell\"...she looked back at me, and we both knew it was true. \n\n\nAs for the music, I recall Foolish Heart being as well executed as it was unexpected.  Everything about every song felt right, the playing was tight, Jerry was having a great time, and he looked good.  The Eyes was perfect, Playin' and Uncle John's were like lovers for the first time, and Corrina was a blast...Laura was floored by the jam out of it...D/S was energetic, and the show just flowed off of every note like it was playing in my sole from me to her...Wheel...Black Peter (see here how everything lead up to this day...), Sugar Mags...Brokedown...they were all mesmerizing, underlined, all T's crossed and I's dotted...beautiful.

Drums sound thin and stuck in left and right channels.\nThe playing is also less than tight. Unlike many other heads here, I think 93 was a low-point, with the band coming back together in 94 and playing very well indeed in 95. Compare Garcia at this show to 95 RFK (just weeks before the end). RFK is by far superior sounding and Garcia much more into his playing. Just my opinion.

      "review_text": "Love This Show I am  of a very small minority that likes 93. After Brent Died they played some great shows. But alot of that was momentum and Hornsbys influence.In 93' they started to come into there own identity with the Bands new lineup. There were still some kinks to work out as far as sound and Bobbys voice was shot.  After taking fall 92' off Garcia looked and played better than he had in years. Although most entire shows lacked coherence, from individual song perspective they put down some excelent versions that are among my favorite of any year. This show is one of the Few Exceptions. It is smoking right out the gates. Garcia's soloing during Jack Straw cooks. Foolish Heart is like a swiss watch they are so tight and the  riff by Weir at the end is lovely. So Many Roads is also a standout.\nEyes>Playin'>UJB> was a nice treat.Also one Hell of a Corrina into drums. post drums are the highlight of the show. A very stong wheel out of space into one of the best Wathtowers ever. Jerrys opening licks let you know that it is going to be killer. His solos are out of this world. The version is much more Dylan then Hendrix although Jerry does pay some tribute at the end of the second verse. Black Peter is good but it really takes of on the final jam that leads into an Epic Sugar Mags. Phil is fucking on. Jerry Phil and Mickey Start SSDD on such a sick groove. Garcia doesnt really solo hard but his licks and tone are just so nice. Like a fine aged wine. Brokedown was the perfect choice to capp of the night. Vince playing and voice are excellent. The board is clean but Garcia should be more Prominent you really have to listen on a Good system to get the full effect. As Far as the Band Being better in 94 or 95 I would disagree Garcia Just seemed to fall of a Cliff in 94 the Rest of the Band played well to compensate but there was no Creativity they just played individualy not collectively. It was acutally too painful to watch alot of nights.",

      "review_text": "An average show, a decent recording, and a mixed mix and still a pretty good time. The opener duo Jack Straw > Foolish is just stunning, however it's got some serious mix jitters that causes a severe cringe or two (big ups to David Link who often used that term in this era of mid 90's shows). \n\nThe mix is a pretty good analogy for 1993, it starts out shaky, improves over time, but despite some very interesting tones and interplay, never gets quite as far as you'd like it to.   Despite the strong start the rest of the first set (mostly) fails to deliver. There is however full redemption in the second set, where Jerry shines.\n\nThis show isn't without it's flaws, but Phil is very clean and upfront (I wonder if this is possibly a tape from the stage board close to what Phil was listening to on his Meyer 833's or his ear monitors (I think this show is around the cusp of that move) as others have noted Jerry isn't very forward in this mix, but some of that is a result of his tone which is somewhat lower than his normal register in the first set (even for this era).  Tom Thumbs is very solid. \n\nThe double dose of dylan is lovely though weir's voice is pretty shot, that brings out Garcia as backup singer, something I think he didn't do enough with Masterpiece. It would be interesting to note how Masterpiece came to be a weir tune in GD land.\n\nDetermined, (stubborn even!) Garcia returns to his new tunes with a somewhat ill-advised trip down So Many Roads. Phil and the drummers move to something resembling autopiliot, but Jerry's tone is now a true force of it's own, it has wings and it soars once before tucking back inside the mix until the second set as the lyrics fade from memory. This flub, as many Garcia flubs do in the later era kicks Jerry's ass into gear. The ice blue roses verse delivers a noteable improvement on everyone's part, but again, this doesn't get all the way there. Promised Land is a throw away Vince showcase.\n\nSet II provides a nice soft reset for the band. The mix comes back a little improved and both Garcia and Lesh seem to be committed to providing the fine folks of Ohio some serious bang for the buck. Despite not ever getting fully coupled, Garcia and Lesh seem to drive in differnt directions and yet somehow, by magic, luck, or pure determination, the musical the train stays on (mostly) on the tracks.\n\nSome good points have already been made here about Garcia being better rested in 93, say what you want about Jerry, but I think the Garcia shows that bracket this tour (April Warfield and Northwest in August) speak volumes about his strengths (and to a much lesser extent his known limitations)in this period. Those strengths, I think, were somewhat stressed by playing with the boys in this particular lineup at this period of time. This is WORK, but hey this ain't California, and these guys aren't playing motown hits from his childhood, and he doesn't get to sing too much on the Dylan tunes. What next? Cold chilli-dogs?\n\nDespite this (imagined?) tension (and to some extent because of it, particularly in the tunes around drums) there's some noteable angst in the Playin here (pun intended). Jerry pulls into long slow spaces and begins to relax, with Lesh close on his heals nearly snapping the bass line with leads and challenges to Garcia's direction. Phil is relentless, he only really lets up at the start of Corina and then only breifly rests returning quickly as task-master). This actually makes for some very heady sets of dimensional caverns that start unfolding with some amazing intersections. When Garcia is finally allowed to wander it's just delightful, with the jam at the end of Cornia as a launching pad for some very beautiful Garcia technicolor. Not to be outdone, Lesh has given up any pretext of playing anything other than lead, and that's working well too, when Jerry pops into midi land we're fully in the Phil Zone.\n\nWhat I like most about this mix is that Vince is very out of the way unless he's soloing, which thankfully doesn't happen all that often. I'm guessing that this is not a true FOH DSDB, but it matters little. If this is a phil mointor board and tapes of the later years exist (even with a cassette gen) with less vince, let's try to get them all into circulation. \n\nWho is going to argue with Eyes > Playin' > Uncle John's? The last three minutes of Space has some subtle and sublime Garcia midi runs, presumably a very low sax sound, and then running up through progressively higher guitar tones) that sparkles in a couple spots before pulling lazily into the wheel. Lesh isn't quite so demanding post drums but is providing a lot of the sign posts on the road. Jerry is drifting now to less remarkable results. Jerry gets a dylan tune of his own, which  provides a balance between laid back and determined. Black Peter which is the first tune that really seems to fit the mood of this show. \"Take a look at poor Peter, he's lying there in pain, now let's go run and see\". Indeed.\n\n1993 is an underrated year, this doesn't rank anywhere near the top of shows played this year, it's warts and all, which isn't half bad.",

Like the review said before get the damn wax out of your ears and truly listen.  Also nobody wants to read your verbose crap review.  If you want to showcase your writing talent publish a book!",

If you like Vince, great- more power to ya. But to tell someone not to comment on their feelings because you don't agree is wrong. Read the review again. it's insightful and comments on the show. No personal attacks just info on the gig on why it works and why it doesn't. Who are you to censor someone because he doesn't agree with your feelings on Vince. get a grip people. The fact that you mention Vince had better solos than Brent did make me laugh hard though.",

Purty neat, purty neat.\n \nWho else besides me was there? Sting was on stage during Foolish Heart, was he not? Conversely speaking, nobody was on stage during Space.\n\nAnd did anybody see where Susan was during the entire first set? I kept waiting for her by the speaker tower, but to no avail. I did finally hook back up with her during intermission, though. Talk about a needle in a haystack-Buckeye Lake is HUGE! Only girlfriend I ever had who was actually a Dead Head.",

      "review_text": "Buckeye Madness It's quite interesting what you do and don't remember.  Thank goodness for these archives.  I don't have much recollection of the show itself.  I remember it rained a lot during that stretch of time from Giants>>the Palace>>>>Buckeye.  A couple of times old Cannie (the name of my friends bus) quit running.  Luckily we were able to push her down a hill and pop the clutch and got her running again. Oh, forgot we got pulled over in Ohio on the interstate somewhere and troopers brought out the dogs and turned the bus upside down.  Wonder what they were looking for since they let us go and slapped the driver on the wrist?  I think he paid the ticket on our way up to Buffalo.\n\nPost show there was a sea of people that flooded the scene and I scored a couple of tasty veggie burritos.  Some dude was going ape nuts and thanking everyone who just helped him purchase a newer conversion van.  \n\nI never really thought about Vince in a good or bad way, just his sound is different from Pigpen, Keith and Brent.  \n\nI wonder what Jerry would have sounded like had the technology of the 90's dead been around during his peak years?\n\nAfter listening to this stream, this is not bad for later day GD.  Not sure what we could have expected from 50 something rockin' hippies, just some good ol' music, good vibes, good times and memories.\n\n3 stars for the good memories it brought back.",

Apparently everyone had the same idea so ticket prices sky rocketed. No way I could afford a ticket at $100 so resigned to sitting this one out. took a trip to the port-o-potty and found a ticket envelope on the ground. One ticket inside I just kept on going, over the highway, through the gates, up to the front row. I went in alone and came out with new friends. Jerry made me laugh and cry. It was the most amazing night...magic. I have had a hard time finding this show. Wish I could download but I am satisfied hearing it like this. Thank you SO much for posting, Love it.",

I'm very, very lucky to have seen as many shows I did & I'm thankful for these fine recordings. \nMy first show was in 1990...Grateful to have seen, heard Brent, but I felt I wasn't able to enjoy a lot of shows because of the \"fans.\" The drunks, the frat turds, the fans who sang along at the top of their lungs! The Deadheads weren't the obnoxious, beer drinking, Party Heads!!! I came along in the stadium era where the weight of The Dead's popularity crushed them, but I'm happy to say the music is what kept me going to the shows, not the party scene.",

This show is a great example of what 1993 Dead had to offer. \n\nThis one takes off right out of the gate and doesn't let up. When I hear jams like the one out of Corrina, it makes me wonder how great this band could have been had Jerry been able to maintain his health. I guess we'll never know.\n\nThis is also a great sounding recording except that the opening Jack Straw is missing. There's another SBD source for this show that seems marginally not quite as good as this one, but it does include Jack Straw.\n",
