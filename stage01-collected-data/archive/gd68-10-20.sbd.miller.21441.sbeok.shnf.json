Sort of like an Olompali family affair. Just playing around by the pool - the background: children screaming in glee, the foreground: lots of amusing stage banter   between chatting with the audience during breaks. \n\nThis is a beautiful recording.

They've taken over my whole life but I have finally found a concert that has made me speechless the whole time I listened to it. And it's this one.\nYou see, inside the album sleeve for Anthem of the Sun are two pictures of the band playing at the Greek. When I attended the Comes A Time tribute to Jerry Garcia in 2005, I remembered that I had pictures of the Dead playing there back in the 60s. So, when my dad and I got home from that long drive (Berkeley to Half Moon Bay), the first thing I did was download this concert. The last concert I downloaded before they took everything down (though there were two more that I got soon afterward that didn't require streaming). When I first heard the concert, I was disappointed. No, it wasn't bad but to my ears 3 years ago, it didn't seem to be primal Dead madness. But listening to it again a few days ago, I am in awe at the magic of this playing. I really don't care if Schoolgirl and Dark Star are cut off at the end. It's really the great music that counts right. And that jarring silence after the greatest Feedback of all time. This concert should be released on album.",

GMLSg -- which is basically an ode to pedophilia -- has always typified that quality, and so I've often just skipped it after the first few bars.\n\nHaving said that, this version is incredibly intense -- it's mostly Phil (if it is Phil...some of the notes suggest that others sat in, and though this sounds like Phil in a later age, nothing from '68 has jumped out at me like this). He's just awesome here -- just right in the mix, bounding all over the place like a Great Dane on 'shrooms, and with that slightly crunchy sound that became prevalent later on.\n\nMy only regret is that Bobby seems to be back in the mix (which may be why we hear Phil so clearly). You have to really concentrate to hear him. Too bad, because he's killing it.\n\nSomebody called this show overrated, and even though I'm only through GMLSg and Lovelight as I write this, I can't see where that would seem to apply.\n\nHey now!",

      "review_text": "One of the best of the 1968 I\u2019ve listened to almost all of the \u201968 shows hear at Archive, as well as those that the Dead released. This one is as good as the February/March shows, and a few from August. One of the rare features it that not only is the \u201cLive Dead\u201d set list top notch, but the Anthem of the Sun material is also excellent. This show compares well to many \u201969 shows as well.\n\nThis tape starts with an exceptional Schoolgirl, already in progress. The jamming and Pig\u2019s vocals are fresh and exciting. In the second half, Jerry lays back and Phil has an extended solo, a real treat for Phil fans.\n\nThe jamming in Lovelight is similarly hot in spots. It doesn\u2019t quite gel like some of the \u201969 shows, but it is a good Lovelight none-the-less.\n\nThe show gets serious with Dark Star is one of best in the golden age of Dark Stars. Moody and lyrical, it flows hear and there, but is a well-crafted composition. Nothing compares to it after 1970.\n\nNext is a Live-Dead-style St. Stephen (in which Jerry cooks) and The Eleven. St. Stephen is perfect, and the Eleven rips--as good as any in 1969. Jerry and Phil duel it out in the first part, then Jerry takes off. Then something unusual happens towards the end: Caution. In this period, The Eleven sometimes transitions into Death Don\u2019t have no mercy. The Eleven into Caution was not common, but it works well here, an interesting transition from Live-Dead-style back into Anthem of the Sun material. The transition is completely seemless. \n\nPipen\u2019s organ starts off Caution, then he begins his rap with a call-and-response. Things get decidedly more pychedelic. The Caution jam kicks in, wild, electric, exciting, but tight and musical. Just dynamite. Things calm down a bit, then revs back up to a short climax, then a transition into feedback.\n\nUnlike the space of later years (which often signaled time for a bathroom break), this feedback is a compelling group composition that holds your attention. In the end, it transitions smoothly into the 60-cycle hum of the PA.\n\nThis show is worthy of many repeat listens.",

A few years ago I started paying more attention to '68,'69 shows and began to appreciate their roots more and more. This show is a perfect example of why. The energy is palatable...........I defy anybody to sit still while listening to this show. Great show, outta sight sound especially for a recording from 1968. All other faults overlooked. Highly recommended.",

Dark Star...or feedback would be the weakest numbers. Little schoolgirl features some mini spontaneous composition jams that will kill ya. The Love Light features more. St. Stephen is aggro, and the eleven> caution may have punched a chunk out of Sagittarius A star and ate in for lunch.",
