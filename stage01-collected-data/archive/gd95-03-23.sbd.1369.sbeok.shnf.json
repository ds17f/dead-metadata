Bruce Hornsby sits in on grand piano and brings incredible energy to the band.  Second set opens with the second ever Unbroken Chain followed by a blazing Scarlet > Fire.  The highlight of the show comes as the rest of the band leaves the stage for Drums, and Hornsby remains at the keys for an extended Matilda jam with the drummers.\n\nThat said, this is not a great recording.  It has a cassette generation, and the levels were set too high somewhere along the way, so there is distortion present at times.",

Bruce Hornsby sitting in on grand piano adds a nice touch, and the band (as well as the fans - \"bruuuuuuuce\") are pleased to have him there. Musically this show is one of my favourite latterday Dead shows, the second set getting a little weirder than usual. However, I have to agree with other reviewers that this recording is mixed funny, having some cymbals quite high in the mix throughout (maybe it was Mickey's feed or something). The first few notes of Unbroken Chain are also missing, which is a shame because it is a good solid rendition otherwise. The audience copy I owned prior to this did better justice to a smokin' show, but it is still great to hear it once again. It would still be nice to see the AUD version listed on here, or even a better SBD. Nice show, worth downloading.",

Bruce had shown up and this clearly energized J.G., and he was able to dig down and shine once more.  just listen to So Many Roads and check the passion.  just listen to Scarlet (even with massacred lyrics) >Fire>Corrina>Mathilda and check the bright playing he displays (particularly Fire which soars and soars).  unfortunetly this sounboard is mixed sort of strange and someone's drums are way high, intruding over everything else way too often... nonetheless.... go to the other source... way better",

Really, I think it sounds like many of the '91 shows. Plus, the UC I'm sure was nice for those in attendance. (Still, there is room for improvement, but cool nonetheless.) Good recording, and like  I say, the quality was not too shabby. If your looking to download a couple shows from 1995, your crazy anyways, but this one is one I would actually recomend to people.",

I spoke with Dennis McNally after the 3-19 Philly show and begged him to get them to play Unbroken in Charlotte.  He paused when I asked him, and said, \"Well, you never know.\"  The place erupted during Unbroken...so much so that I thought the place was gonna crash down.  I have to thank Hornsby for helping to pump up the band a bit on this night.",

Although the sound is pretty darn good, Hornsby is pretty far back in the mix, and as one previous reviewer mentioned, the drums are mixed a little hot for my taste. I am not a big Wang Dang fan, but I love Garcia's harmony parts, even though that vocal sound is basically the result of lots of smoking of cigarettes and other things. \n\nI don't think Jerry's playing is very strong here even with the addition of Mr. Hornsby. Although I do think the Fire gets going better than most anything from 95.",

      "review_text": "Jerry's Last Stand I was fortunate enough to attend this show from the luxury sky box of one of the nation's largest banking institutions. Had the chairman of the board of that bank entered the sky box that evening banking might be done in an entirely different fashion. Undisirregardless (I made that word up for all those who don't know that \"irregardless\" is not a word), the boys were on that evening. The first set was mediocre and short (45 minutes) with no real highlights. There were, however, decent versions of Half Step, Cold Rain and Snow, Easy Answers, and a So Many Roads closer. The So Many Roads gave hints of things to come. Much like the second set itself, this version has some minor flaws but is actually quite inspired. \nThe second set opened and one could feel confusion, and then recognition overtake the Coliseum. Unbroken Chain had only JUST been broken out in Philly a few days before. And here it was in all it's glory. Phil's vocals are flawless. The jam section only hints at what could have been had they played this in the 70's or had Jerry cleaned up his act and lived a few more decades. Regardless, this is THE Unbroken Chain of all the live versions. I've heard them all and know of what I speak. The crowd was deliriously happy after they finished Unbroken Chain and they chose to follow it with a SCORCHING/RIPPING/SHREDDING Scarlet/Fire that brought the entire crowd back up to it's feet in a hurry. Yes, yes... Jerry blows some vocals. It's not the tape... it's the show... BUT WHO CARES?!?! Jerry plays as if every note is a fight for his life and he is winning the battle... intense, passionate, confident, one feels as if he could have gone on forever. This man is possessed! Bobby's rythm shreiks and fills are truly outstanding on Fire, in particular. Hornsby seems to drive the band. Ya just gotta own this in order to truly understand. Corrina is haunting and one of the best versions I've ever heard. Mathilda is the only song of the set that I don't really care for but it serves it's purpose as a great lead into the drums. And let me not forget to mention the piano/drums trio-ette (is that a word) leading into the drums. It rocks! Even the Space portion of this set is do-able. And as good as the first 4 songs of this set were, The Days Between which follows Space is a melancholy thing of beauty. Jerry's vocals are soulful and his playing inspired, thus turning a slow song into something beautiful and inspiring. Good Lovin to close the set is about as inspiring as most Bobby songs to end concerts... short and sweet, nothing spectacular, but usually nothing horrible either. The Weight encore was a nice, different, unususal choice. \nOK kids... this is THE show of 95 and must be owned. Your lives are not complete without it in your collection. The sound quality is tasty. The show itself just shreds. I even go so far as to nominate this as a Dick's Picks or a Vault release. And this recommendation comes from a guy who WAY prefers 60s/70s Dead to almost anything from the 80s or 90s. Ya just got to trust me on this one.",

Maybe he forgot some lyrics, but his playing was tight.  The whole band was in \"show\" form.  Obviously, when Bruce is on the grand and into the show, you definitley need to pick up your game.  That's exactly what the boys did!  There are arrows after every song in the second set.  If you saw the next night(not to much energy), it's obvious they laid it all out with Bruce. Great Show!

      "review_text": "Great show, strange vibe I think this series were shows 9,10 and 11 for me. Pretty young in my Dead career (embarrassedly I admit I crooned out the wrong lyrics during He's Gone); the vibe out in the lot was electric. Frat guys pumping Dead out of the back of their hummers decked with studio grade speakers, lots of new Heads like myself everywhere, cops announcing \"6 up\" as they drove by, Scramble bus. \nThe vibe in the show was wayy different. Bruce brought a sweet surprise but the series had a gloomy cloud over it. I remember thinking Jerry was on his last leg.\nAnyhow, just my memories. Sorry to ramble. Enjoy, this embodies the vibe (good and bad) of 95.",

I saw Unbroken Chain at my last show and almost left since it was so bad. Jerry couldn't play a solo over the 5/4 section to save his life. And the new songs like Corrina, Easy Answewrs and Wave to the Wind (just to name a few) all were pretty bad. I was always amazed that they kept playing those tunes. Like they were going to all of a sudden be great...not.",

      "review_text": "Hate to admit it, but... I was at this show. It had been five years since I had done any more than one night, so on a whim I accepted a ride to Charlotte with an option for Atlanta, Memphis, Birmingham, and Tampa. I skipped off with $90 and two tickets, one for each night at the Pyramid.  \n  As is wont to occur on tour, a little ingenuity and energy helped parlay that $90 and two tickets into 7 shows, lots of beer, enough food (not high on the list of priorities) to survive, a couple bags of grass, one night in a hotel (Birmingham, Alabama), and plenty of other goodies that any Deadhead could figure out without too much thought.\n  This show was among the seven I got in to. I remember feeling a touch of that old feeling early on, the \"F'n YEAH all RIGHT swweeet- I'm standing in A GRATEFUL DEAD CONCERT!!!\".\n  At that point in my life, even after being there 50 or so times in the 80's, a Grateful Dead concert was still the only place on earth where I could honestly say to myself that there was NO PLACE IN THE WORLD!!!! where I would rather be right now!! \n  After that feeling faded away, what was left was a musical experience that would be called mediocre if I felt really nostalgic and generous. Truth be told, the show was awful. It left me feeling so sad at what I had lost. \n  I had lost the indescribable ecstasy the band had bestowed upon me so effortlessly those last 50 or so nights where I had shared the same room with those 6 or so men. \n  In its place was a bushel of feelings associated with loss. Loss of a loved one, loss of tangible things, just LOSS. \n  SO, so sad.\n  If you want to feel sad, listen to this show in the context of what we used to have from this group. I guess without perspective, a totally objective critique might garner two stars for this show, but in terms of what we lost, this show warrants zero stars. \n  Bruce tried, to no avail. This one was doomed from the start. Really good drugs would likely only serve to magnify the futility of this band on this night.\n  I know its harsh, and honestly, it is hard to type these words, but someone needs to tell it like it is.\n  Unless you were there and would like to relive it, there is absolutely no reason to toss away a minute of your life listening to this show. \n  Sorry fellas. I recommend trying an earlier era that might interest you.",

      "review_text": "Misperception I was at this show.  I don't remember the music.  I remember the crowd inside and outside of the coliseum.  They were predominately young, GD teeny boppers drinking lots of alcohol.  They seemed to be more interested being part of a scene than actually enjoying the GD experience.\n  \nThis is what changed most over the years post 1983-4.  Young alcohol-infused crowds waiting for the band transform them.  It was an impossible task for a tired, jaded, road worn group of middle-aged rock and rollers.\n\nListening to the show now, it's very enjoyable within the context of the 1990's GD.  It stands the test of time even with sloppy lead guitar and raspy voice of Jerry.  \n\nLong live the GD.  RIP Jerry!",

      "review_text": "What's the difference exactly? Another reviewer wrote: \"They were [predominately] young, GD teeny boppers drinking lots of alcohol. They seemed to be more interested being part of a scene than actually enjoying the GD experience.\" \n\nI would venture to say that alcohol was always a part of the Grateful Dead experience-for some. One of the biggest drawbacks of the later shows was the sense of entitlement and begrudging attitudes of the older folks. Tapers that bitched and moaned if you dare cheered the band between songs...etc.etc. There was a lot of BS happening at the end and it kinda always was. If Jerry forgetting some lyrics bummed you out that much why not just quit going to shows? If drunk kids didn't try and continually \"be part of the scene\" there would be no scene. The duty of the elder is to teach, not admonish. Too many older heads lost sight of what was important. They are as much to blame for the scene fading as it was the younger kids with no sense. But as Bobby sang to the older folks dismay:\"You don't have to say a word, you got dick to say\" lol",

      "review_text": "I wouldn't regret having attended Above par for '95, and really some fine salvageable moments. Garcia wasn't chronically off the entire show and, again, \"90s Dead\" is a matter of taste rather than, as many think, an absolutely irrefutable musical decline.\n Re the booze, this happens a lot in the South (and probably in other specific geographic regions). I saw two shows in Charlotte and many elsewhere in the South over two decades and it is simply a demographic fact that alcohol plays a significant role in the concert-going scene. Generally not a big deal. Deadheads hold their liquor as well as anything else they've ingested ; it's a polite and generous crowd, whatever the predominant buzz.\nTry Tampa if you can't stand this!",

It\u2019s important to note that I was into much heavier music at the time. The show started and I remember thinking that they were playing country music, something that I disliked at the time. My friend and I were the only two people sitting down in the entire arena. A couple of heads saw us sitting down and came over to introduce themselves. We made a trade of some local produce we brought for some puffy paper there brought. I can still remember the song that was playing when everything changed. Scarlet/Fire. I have been a fan ever since and have been looking for some type of footage from that show.",
