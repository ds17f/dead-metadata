Phil's backup vocals seem a little high in the mix in the first few songs. Good energy and intensity from Cold Rain and Snow through China > Rider and Good Lovin (awesome drum solo). Recording blip or error on Casey Jones. Download it to have an early Winterland show. Peace out.",

I remember this record sold as Fillmore West August 1971...(see http://www.livecollection.net/liveset/dead/dead_bootlegs.htm\nThis version of Uncle John's Band is used as an extra track on the current relase of \"Workingman's Dead\" (here, the liner notes say Winterland Oct 4 1970 which corresponds with archive.org).\nGarcia's chops are impressive; here he is very snappy and charged up. High voltage solo in Sugar Magnolia.",

Fortunately it's a distinctive setlist, so I was able to identify it.\n\nPhil is massive in this show, really ferocious. I can imagine that he considered this tone to be over-distorted; not really, Phil, it's a long way from Jack Bruce and Tim Bogert sub-sonic flatulence.\n\nSo that's one reason to get this under-noticed show. The other is the definitive China-Rider. Not the longest, cleanest, or furthest out, this is nonetheless a great one, with intuitive guitar interaction, and passionate vocals. For me, from that ancient anonymous bootleg, this has been the China-Rider to compare all others to, and getting to hear it again after all these years confirms that.\n\n(This was the night Janis Joplin died. I've read in several places how the back-stage staff attempted to keep the band unaware of that. It's clear they succeeded, because this show is too joyous to have been aware of the tragedy in LA.)",

Perhaps it was the spector of Jack Casady (of the Jefferson Airplane) in the house.  Later that evening, Casady would blow away his own band.\nOh yes - the other GD members were not slouches either!!!!  Remember, when we saw this show in present time, a lot of the GD material was still fresh.",

      "review_text": "Morning Becomes Electric A very good show in a dynamite year. A very rare \"Till the Morning Comes.\" Deadlists shows only six performances of that song, all from fall 1970. Considering the context of 1970, a year with so many phenomenal performances and such live spark and dynamism, this is a very good. I agree with the comments on China>Rider; it is a nuanced, layered, and beautiful rendition -- yes almost quintessential. Phil does stand out, but he so often does, if you listen for him. The rest of the show is very good. Everything else is played at a high-level, and \"Brokedown,\" \"Cold Rain and Snow,\" and \"Uncle John's\" are notably inspired. \n\nThere are many sound quirks to this recording, but overall it is a very good '70 show, but not a great one in a year of great shows -- my favorite Dead year too (at least for now).",

      "review_text": "Another Mystery Solved! Like others have mentioned I had an old \"Mother Records\" Vinyl Bootleg of this show back in '71, that did not identify the date or venue. That bootleg was my only Grateful Dead Album for a couple of years and I listened to this China/Rider obsessivly until I could finally figure out where Jerry & Bobby's guitar parts diverged and converged. This remains my favorite China/Rider, if for no other reason than for Jerry's perfect little intro riff to \"I Know You Rider\". It's just like the way he used to sneak into the opening of \"Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad\". Sure, some of the later mid-70s versions have some really cool complex UJB-style jams in the China/Rider transition, but for pure soulfullness and perfect timing this one is hard to beat. Thanks to the archive for helping me locate this seminal show.",

      "review_text": "reopening of winterland That's what this was billed as. the New Riders opened, then the Dead, followed by the Airplane, and then Quicksilver. By this time the Dead were the top draw and the crowd showed it. After their set, the crowd wouldn't stop cheering for \"more Dead\" and when the mc came out to remind us that there was still the Airplane and Quicksilver we all kept yelling \"more Dead\". The show was broadcast on KQED so you had Slick hamming it up to the cameras etc. The boys were very energetic and clearly the the best set of the evening. The airplane were coming apart, Dryden was already gone, playing with the New Riders, and Marty Balin quit the band the next day but Cassidy played like the monster he was. Quicksilver came out in sparkly suits with a horn section and Dino was in charge. I give it five stars for my experience there, probably really a four.",

      "review_text": "The Great Quadraphonic Broadcast This was touted as the world's first quadraphonic broadcast and I remember it like it was today and I remember it was a fabulous success. The audio was from two FM stations and the video was supplied by KQED Channel 9, who still owns the tapes and keeps them in their vault. Supposedly they are not of high enough resolution and quality to package by GD Prods/Rhino, and that is a shame because the Dead really shine. I would love to see a 5.1 surround sound DVD of this entire show, but it would be a monstrous restoration project. Maybe some day...\n\nI was not able to attend this show because when Bill Graham announced this as the Quicksilver Retirement Show the tickets were gobbled up in one day. If you didn't live next to a ticket outlet in San Francisco you were out of luck. Demand was so high for tix that Graham added another show the next night which I was able to attend and was sort of a wake for Janis. It was a low key affair.\n\nBut on this night we ventured over to the neighborhood geek's house and he set up an incredible sound system for us with dual FM receivers and tv sets all over his wire-strewn house. The sound was indescribably phat and with close-ups of the band on our tv screens it was better than being in Winterland. Never had I heard anything so well-defined sonically. It was that good. No, it was great. The music sounded so good it made you instantly high without drugs.\n\nOn a side note, because of the dual FM broadcast the normal 3 to 7 second delay was not in effect, it was the first time I had ever heard the F-bomb over the airwaves. Dusty Street, a DJ for KSAN, was interviewing people backstage with her ersatz, turned-on hippie chick patter and when she asked the bespectacled Mr Casady, \"Isn't this far-out?\" good ol' Jack looked at her with disdain and said plainly \"F___ you!\" I almost went into convulsions  for I had never been that fond of Dusty Street. I always thought she was a phony. I was not wrong. She not only found the Grateful Dead to be despicable morons, but she deemed all of the SF rock scene as an insult to her highbrow jazz and classical tastes. Hey, this was just a job to her.\n\nThere were a select few more quadraphonic broadcasts in the SF region in 1970 and 1971 and that was it. There was no interest from the FM stations to carry the same programming as a competitor. Such a shame. I will never forget the sound emanating from those speakers at Groover McTuber's house that night. In a way it was kind of his coming out party for he had a bad rep in the area and the neighborhood mothers didn't want their innocent little darlings to go over to his house for fear he would tarnish our souls. But Groover was no phony. He turned out to be a very nice and hospitable man and that is why we must cherish our electronics nerds. Still, to this day, I have yet to hear better sound reproduction coming from home stereo speakers. A toast to you Groover, wherever you may be.\n\nThis rates a 5 for sheer historical value.",

I would sure love to have a copy of that show...I could never remember if it was in 1970 or 1971 - thanks for clearing that up for me. At first we were to the right side of the stage (from the audience point of view), then we moved to watch for a little bit of Jefferson Airplane's set from the left side of the stage, then as you say caught a ride home with my Dad and watched the rest of it on TV (Ch.9, KQED). Yeah, I loved the mirror-ball too!\"",

      "review_text": "energetic but quite sloppy I like this version of the GD best, the one that includes Pigpen and two drummers!  I have to admit though, a band couldn't get away with playing this sloppily nowadays.  For instance, in Good Lovin', after a long drum solo, the drummers bring up the heat and expect rest of the band to come in with them. When they don't, the drummers have to re-group and start their cue again.\nSugar Magnolia is WAAAY too fast, and it sounds like the band can barely keep up the tempo. As far as Garcia in Casey Jones is concerned, it just shows you what can happen if either you are too stoned, or you have a bad monitor setup (or both). \nYes, I know, the Dead were not overly concerned with professional polish, and their modus operandi allowed them to take risks that others would not. But I'm sure they were embarrassed by such slip-ups, especially when they knew that other bands were in attendance, and were probably listening. In this case, the band was probably not happy to know that the concert was being broadcast as well.",

Some super sweet hippies took us in while it was being fixed, and we heard the GD were playing Winterland, with NRPS, QMS, and the Airplane. I had seen the GD twice before: March of '67 at the Avalon and the summer of '68 at the gym at MPC Junior College, in Monterey. I was a huge Deadhead, tho really only from listening to their albums.\nWhat I remember most from this show was that some guy was passing out free psilocybin(which I of course took) and Grace Slick announcing from the stage \"We'd all like to thank the Psilly Man for his generosity tonight.\" And that the GD definitely sounded different live than on album.\nWe did not find out until the next day that Janis had died that night.",

      "review_text": "Loosey-goosey goodness. Had the band been told about Janis before stepping out on stage? I don't know, but the poignancy of this Brokedown Palace suggests that they might've heard the news. \n\nOn a night that had a few different bands on the bill, the boys had a shorter window than usual to pack in their performance. This recording is the product of the Fall '70 Grateful Dead lineup being given about an hour to play. They go for quantity over psychedelia, so we get a dozen shorter tunes instead of a big Dark Star > St. Stephen > The Eleven sequence or That's It for the Other One. \n\nThey put in a good effort. The pace is there, and although none of the songs really catch on fire, overall it's a groovy little gig with strong bass and drumming. Very loose. Daily Dose of the Dead has a great article explaining the mix, and why Phil's bass is so loud on this pull. On other archive.org sources, you can find 45 seconds worth of the Truckin', and even hear the KSAN setbreak broadcast.\n\nI like the American Beauty material from this show the best, but it's all worth a listen! Fun little hour of '70 Dead. Time to pack my bags for my trip to see Bobby, Willie, and SCI tomorrow night at SPAC. ",
