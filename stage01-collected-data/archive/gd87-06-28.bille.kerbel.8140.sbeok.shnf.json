For me, it was particularly special because I had the next 2 weeks off of work and had tickets through Roanoke (except for Canada - what a shame).  Man, what a time it was!\n\nMusically, I thought this was the weakest of the Alpine run, with nothing too spectacular going on.  The lone exception was the Jack Straw, which wraps up the first set in stunning blaze of glory!  The boys wrung out every note on this one.  Super good stuff.  I have been fortunate enought to witness some world class Jack Straws and this was one of them.  Worth checking out even if you don't go for the whole show.",

I vaguely remember a couple things from the first set: \n\n1) Bobby having equipment problems in the middle of the set and kicking his rig. Phil jumped his shit for it, and they had a spat on stage. Jerry just wandered over to Brent while they were going at it.\n\n2) The Jack Straw was indeed tremendous, but I also recall the Althea being strong as well. I'm streaming it now, so I guess I'll find out soon enough.\n\nBoy, nothing like afternoon Dead shows. Having the entire evening to run around the parking lot was just fantastic.

      "review_text": "Probably the weakest of the three nights, but not anything poor or medicore as found at some of the Greek and Ventura shows. 1st Set: Since it has yet to be played, anyone calling the \"Hell\" as da opener does not quite deserve the title of master prognosticator. It gets quite trippy with all of the sound effects, but that doesn't distract from the good version it is. \"Sugaree\" through \"Mexicali\" are nothing more than good ol' Grateful Dead. \"Althea\" is a standout, mostly because of Jerry's solos... \"Rooster\" grinds itself like an 18 wheeler which makes it odd then they choose to follow with the smooth, jazzy \"Bird Song.\" Nothing remarkable here, folks...but that all changes when they step into \"Jack\" land. An incredibly tense and exciting 'Straw' end your run of the mill decent 1st. \n\n2nd Set: \"Mississippi\" is friendly, and the timing of Jerry's notes after they 'crossed the lazy river' is exemplary. \"Man Smart\" was the predictable choice, and it's a pleasant version. (Standard) \"Ship\" was the obvious call, even though \"To Lay Me Down\" would have pleased me more. The familiarity continues with \"Saint\" although the tension from 4:40-4:50 is palpable. I was in the \"Drummy\" mood when I heard this, so this version, tho seemingly unremarkable, pleased me. You can smell the \"Miracle\" about 7:25 into a martian-laden \"Space.\" The 'M' was fine, but feeling the blues in their outro jam, it would have been a keen choice to go into a missed \"Smokestack\" or \"Spoonful.\" Nope, it's \"Dew\" time. Underwhelming. Anyways, because it's the final show of a three night run, it's expected that \"Throwing/NFA\" will be played, and tonight is no exception. \"Throwing\" is well-sung, and is better than the one at the Greek... Despite some nice Jerry around plucking @ 2:45 this version is not as much of a eagerly grind it out as the Greek's. Unlike the Greek, the boys come back and do some more percussions, and bop-bop-bop-bop for everyone. \nNo \"Brokedown\" tonight, let's shout one out for 'The Mighty Quinn.' It's provides the requisite amount of joy.",

I remeber when Bobby got plugged back in and gave the nod to Jerry, Jerry stpped up to the mic and puns, \"Ladies & genlemen, Mr. Bob Weir!\"\n\nThey really made you feel like you were part of what was going on.  All in good fun.\n\nLot's-O notes on the Jack Straw, but not much metnion of the Dew.  I seem to remember it was short, but Jerry ripped some killer solos.\n\nAlso, I forgot the tickets for this show back at our cabin.  I did not realize until we were parked.  What a tirp.  I remember jumping a berm in my Sky blue '74 SuperBeetle.  Friends later told me that was the first time they ever saw a bug get full air.  We were staying on Lake Geneva in Williams Bay in my families Lazy summer home.  We FLEW!  \n\nWe walked in on Sugaree.

A bunch of Cheesehead pseudoheads.\n\nAnyway I hooked up with my buddy from NJ who was driving across the USofA after a year in LA. My luggage got lost by Northworst airlines and I had to borrow clothes from my NJ buddy.To say that we partied like rockstars would be an understatement.\n\nMy bud had hooked up with a bunch a freaks in CA at the Berkeley Greek shows and they were outta hand. Pat had a deep reserve of M80s and decided that his mission in life was to pitch them into the overflowing with crap porta johns. We saw more than one disgisted face open the toilet door only to be confronted with shit everywhere and smoke bellowing out! It was the BOMB.\n\nThen there were the ChiTown drunks pounding on the door to the Hare Krishna bus at about 2 am demanding burgers and beers. Finally there was the guy wandering around with luminescent eyes carrying a sign emblazoned with a \"9\" he's walk up to you and say \"Number 9\" as he showed the sign- and then as fast as he was there, he was gone. That guy should be on Mt Rushmore.\n\nNow of course the shows were all smokin' and tripadelically outrageous- the first non-Greek Watchtower, a tasty Music and the angst ridden Jack Straw were all highlights. Jer Bear was on fire.\n\nThe cosmic significance of these days is still beyond the comprehension of mere mortals- but I get it.\n\nSex and Violence\n\nBTW #9",

I Know it's been over two years since your insightful review of this show, but as a mere mortal pseudohead from the midwest I'd like to thank you for all of the outstanding east coast genuine flavor you and your buddies brought to fly-over country. You'll notice that the band played arguably some of their best summer tour shows from year to year at Alpine and later Deer Creek in Indiana. I believe the genuine good-natured vibes of many midwestern heads lent to a chilled-out atmosphere missing from the often uptight scenes on the (pick your) coast, post Touch. I don't believe it was a pack of locals who trashed Alpine in 89, the year the Dead was asked never to come back. Nor do I believe it was some Indiana farm boys who rioted Deer Creek in '95, tearing down the fence and causing the cancellation of what would have been my last show. I met so many mellow  heads from all walks of life and all regions of the country, I don't want to discriminate here. What I do want to say is that summer tour from the middle of the country produced some outstanding vibes and stellar shows. The band's all packed and gone but the music remains, bend an ear.",

My friend's older sister drove us and I had listened to some 8 tracks and Lps so I knew some songs: definitely not most of the set list.  100+ dead and 30+ Jerry shows later totally quit in '94 and was thinking seriously about Fall of '95. Rumors were MSG, Boston the usual, maybey even anounced, but......\nDidn't even go to the last shows in my hometown Chicago '05. I was living there at the time, but WTF I had my own band.\nSo years later I get SIRIUS and I hear about archive.org and one post later.... I am so psyched about hooking up my computer to my stereo. Great memories, and I dont exactly remember them playing it that afternoon; Throwing Stones lyrics are so relevant today.\nThus my reason for using this site trying to hear a kick ass version of the song. \nHappy 21st in a couple months whoever posted last WOW.",

      "review_text": "Transition I think - and hindsight is always 20/20 - this was really a transition period for the boys.\n\nGarcia was less than a year removed from his recovery. The bands first show back was a mere 7 months prior to this period.\n\nI think the later '86 shows were really to help Jerry get back on his feet and in the groove, thank God. I certainly have no more knowledge than most reading and listening, but the early going was 1) short versions of tunes with little jamming; and the band re-inventing itself for perhaps the 1000th time.\n\nBut, if you look at the set lists and listen to the shows from let's say March 87 - until the stadium shows with Dylan - the band is solid. Predictable - absolutely. But I listened to this whole show and it had hints of '85 ( I say hints). Also, the 4/3/87 show - which I was skeptical about being the second most downloaded show is worth a listen.\n\nProblems - already mentioned predictability. \nSongs like NFA were diminished to throw aways.\nBucket>Sugaree became a given. (And that is a shame b/c at one time - '83 - bucket was actually groovey. And Sugaree is one of Garcia's best).\n\nAnyway I give this show 4 stars. Once the Fall '87shows started I think the band had begun a bit of prefunctory set list dilemna that did not resolve itself until \"Formerly the Worlocks\" - and not just b/c of \"dark star\" and \"help>slip\".\n\nSee - it's not easy to look at the band in one moment during one song during one set - their is in my humble opinion a bigger picture.\n\nAnyway peace and God bless",
