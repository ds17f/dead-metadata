I only got on the bus in 87 and assumed I'd never hear that tune played. Though this version is a fine one and the presence of the accordion is barely audible, ( and even sounds good when it is ) I really, really didn't need that nonsense spoiling the view of what could have been the single high point in all my touring. That said, how upset could someone really be seeing a set like this?  The setlist says it all. Bruce, I love ya man, but damn. Thanks anyway ;)",

December brought the short notice Oakland shows, which I found disappointing, the Tempe shows, which were a blast, and then hometown.  Needless to say, I was a bit ragged.  Also, being 19 it was a treat to have backstage passes for this run.  Even though nothing is there. \n\nThe whole run was great, and everyone was stoked that they played alot of the tunes they broke out in the past year.  Plus, all my tour friends stayed at my house, and it was snowy, and in the middle of final exams....just a great fucking time.  Also, these was some of the first shows I really got to see Hornsby getting down at.  \n\nAt the time, nobody bitched about the accordion, but I remember folks used to bitch all the time when only the first verse of dark star was sung.  I never understood this complaint.\n\nI wish there was a good FOB on the archive, although I don't think that any were made.  \n\nIf you like '90s dead, get this one.  Not up to the standard of the Spring run, but damn good.",

I have never seen Jerry so aminated in trying to urge on his mates.  The Deal......let's just say it was 'hippie heavy metal.'\nThe 2nd set through Drums will live in infamy.  I kept trying to get it together but the boys kept launching me into the stratosphere! Brilliant.\nI must weigh in on the Dark Star....I feel sorry that so few people weren't able to enjoy the moment. I thought it well played even if there was an accordian in the mix. Next you are going to tell me that the Terrapin that rose from the ashes of the STAR wasn't as good as some in '77.  I guess there are always going to be critics.  For my money, the run @ McNichols was in the top 3 for the 90's",

It was going to be interesting seeing the boys for the first time since Brent (the rumored Red Rocks gigs right after his passing not to be), he was a highlight for me those years.\n\nI was enjoying the novelty of working my day job before driving down for the night's show. A buddy and I were kicking around ideas for set lists for that night. At one point we got to \"China Rider and Dark Star before drums\", and were just laughing about the idea, and moved on to other more \"serious, realistic\" topics. But when actually it came about, holy cow I was floored.\n\nThen one of my favorite musical moments with the Dead, when then opened Terrapin up out of Dark Star. It was like someone pushed me over the edge with a light touch from their pinky. Delirious joy.\n\nCheck out NFA, where right after the first lyrics the crowd claps the beat out super tight and loud; Jerry and the band just riffed off of our \"drumming\".\n\nI remember a buddy of mine let his (non-deadhead) wife convince him that he only needed to go to one of these 3 shows. He picked night 2; a tough choice for the Dark Star fan that he was!\n\nGreat show, great times.",

      "review_text": "Mediocre At Best Let's be honest. There is a lot better from 1990 (3/29, 6/8, 9/19, 9/20, 10/20, 12/31). From the era we have 10/9/89, 10/26/89 and especially 9/10/91!\n\nJust because you where there doesn't make it good. I had to suffer through most of the show to get to the few highlights: Lucy, Iko, Dark Star> Terrapin. There are MUCH better versions of Lucy, DS and Terrapin in the 70's.\n\nThe Charlie Miller copy of this show helps with the sound (too much keyboard here).",

      "review_text": "\"Mediocre at Best?\"  You are out of your tree dood. 1990 was a great year musically despite the huge tragedy of Brent's untimely passing.  Late 1990 was no different.  While the addition of Vince was quite a departure of quality on the keys, the installation of Bruce Hornsby seemed to goose the band a bit - especially Jerry.  \n\nI had been on tour since Spring 1989 and had seen 70+ shows by this point so the fact that I was there has little to do with my perception of how great this show was.  I had already seen many great nites and some that were much less so.  Was this the best show of 1990, nope.  It IS however in the basket of very special shows that the boys pulled off in 1990. The AZ shows that led up to the McNichols run were great fun and well played.  The desert weather was a nice interlude before getting dropped into the freezer in Denver.\n\nTouch had a rather perfunctory beginning but started to really sizzle as it neared its conclusion.  Greatest was a little scattered and never really hit the stride that it had occasion to.  If you wanted to judge the show by the 1st 2 songs, I might not argue too much about it being an average show.  Candyman was the beginning of the musical ascent.  Great effects by Jerry here and very impassioned vocals \u2013 wings were starting to spread here.  Walkin Blues was usually a bathroom song for me \u2013 not this night > overlook this at your peril.  The standouts on this were Bobby and Bruce.  Quicker rhythms by Weir seemed to set the pace.  Vince got in the act for a bit and then correctly decided to get out of the way.  Hornsby swooped in with a great solo and wonderful energy that worked up the crowd into a good lather before Bobby broke back into the lyrics > a roar of appreciation followed.  Jerry stepped it up even higher with a rip-roarin\u2019 Loose Lucy!  Played with the requisite gusto and then some!  At one point when the rest of the band was trying to fall in line, Jerry stepped back, looked across the stage at his mates and started leanin\u2019 into it as only Jerry can!  So good.\n\nThe Mexicali > Maggie\u2019s was high octane!  The mexi was just\u2026.wonderfully absurd!  It was like a mix between carnival music and puerile jam band acid rock.   Energy was built to a fever pitch before it galloped its way into an outstanding Maggie\u2019s.   Solid stuff until Phil stepped to the mic for his part.  He belts it out and drops some bombs and the place goes totally bonkers!  Seriously, listen to an audience version > total meltdown.   Things calm down some with Queen Jane.  Over the course of the song, it was clear that Jerry was getting a little cagey.   QJ is not a tune that would let it all hang out but it was clear to me that Jerry wanted to do exactly that.  He got what he wanted with the next offering.  DEAL.  I could write more to describe this but it won\u2019t do it justice.  Jerry has done some unbelievable Deal\u2019s and this one was no different.  No fewer than 5 crests on this version > fucking spellbinding \u2013 no other words can describe.  I had to take a knee after this one \u2013 thank God for set-break.\n\nListen to the China > Rider.  Incendiary shit here > It\u2019s all Jerry from start to finish.  Frankly, I think the rest of the band decided to get out of his way on this one.  Not that their playing was not inspired mind you, they just wanted Jerry to wring everything out of it that he could.  During the cool Colorado rain of Rider, I think the roof lifted off.   Maybe not an all-time version of the suite, but up there with Shoreline 1990 for sure.  LL Rain bugged me at first.  How could they play LLR after just dropping THAT bomb?!?   They pulled off an all-timer in my eyes.  Jerry was all over that guitar \u2013 I mean ALL over it > not a wasted note here.  That coupled with palatable Weir-Wailings and Drum-induced thunder made me feel like an ass for doubting the song selection.\n\nThe passage that followed will go down as one of the best combos of 1990.  Iko > Dark Star > Terrapin.  Totally absurd Iko with a false start that finished with a Midi flurry that was unbelievable.   The Dark Star was tight yet exploratory despite being a bit marred by Bruce\u2019s use of the accordion.  It had the chance to be really special had that decision not been made.  It was by no means un-enjoyable, just a little too experimental for my tastes.  As the DS wound down into a spacey soup, I expected drums to take over.  Nope.  The musical tapestry of Terrapin begin to take shape out of the ashes of DS, and the place went nuts.  A strong version to be sure.   Charmed inspiration built and built, and carved its way to the eventual apex in all its glory!  So good.   D > S provided the requisite break I needed.\n\nWild Watchtower.  Bobby kept looking over at Jerry as if to suggest.  DAMN Jerry \u2013 what got into you?!  Once that tune was sufficiently owned, Jerry slid us into a blissfully bittersweet Stella Blue.  It freaking shined!  As with Jerry best songs of the nite, he didn\u2019t waste a single note.  Throwin Stones seemed to signal the band was a little gassed.  It was a little better than pedestrian, but I think the band was catching their collective breaths.  They had just taken it about as high as they could.  NFA showed their 2nd wind even if it never travelled as far as we all wished it would.  The Weight encore was another highlight.  Everyone was waiting for Phil\u2019s turn > listen to the Aud.  Holy Shit!\n\nMediocre at best?  You are out of your blessed mind.  I think you just don\u2019t want to like it for some reason or are somehow are hearing something much different than everyone else is.  I get it though, post-Brent leaves much to be desired.  Be careful not to avoid it though.  Late 1990 and all of 1991 have quite a few mind-blowers.  Bruce helped Jerry get to places and had not been in awhile!  Curious:  reviewr gave 10.1.94 5 stars.  While certainly a good -even great- show by 1994 standards, it's does't hold McNihols jock.  Goes to show you don't ever know.....",

It was just one incredible song after another, and the energy in McNichol's Arena that night was high, magical, electric.  And a Dark Star, to boot!!  WOOHOO!  I walked out of this show on a cloud that I didn't come down from for a week. Seriously.  Thank you, God!!!",

Bobby singing, \"March winds will blow all my troubles away\" was the foreshadowing for the next line, being in Denver, it lifted the roof, \"I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain.\"\n\nBruce was great during the show. So much positivity. \n\nThanks for the recording and archive.org. Seems like I had a DAT with better quality, but SHN on this amazing archive is excellent. Thanks again.",
