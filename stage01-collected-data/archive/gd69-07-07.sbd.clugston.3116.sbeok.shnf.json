The sound quality isn't excellent, but nothing that will keep you from listening to it again.  Truthfully an amazing show all the way from the first track to the last...not something that can always be said for dead shows.

Apparently this was a free concert, and due to the band's lack of pressure to do well (not that there was much anyway) they pulled off an incredible show, bursting with energy. However, the first several songs are rough, with the exception of a very early Casey Jones (with a different intro and instrumental sections) and High Time and Morning Dew have some very rough Jerry vocals. \nBut the Dark Star is fantastic, and the beginning jamming is landmark, taking 13:32 (!) to hit the first verse. Hear the audience go nuts, it's that good. I still prefer 11/2/69's Star, but this one is damn close. Amazing 37-minute Lovelight to close out this show. \nPlus, this is one of those shows that has DICK'S PICKS written all over it. Though the quality is very raw with considerable hiss, that could be cleaned up for a Dick's Picks. Smoking show.",

Now the spirit still manages to slip through tight fisted corporate fingers via this internet stream.  Bob Weir in a penstripe suit?

A true hippy crash pad.",

      "review_text": "Beginning of Lovelight is AWESOME! I just spent the last 4 evenings this week going through every lovelight there is just to find a version I have been craving and lost. Just found it tonight, thanks god.   I never expected it to take this long...  For this version not to be on the top 10 list, or even honorable mention, just for the guitar work from 2:30 to 4:06, is surprising (although that may be due to the quality of the recording?).\n\nThe sycopation that settles in with the drums at 00:16 is so groovy...  Pig Pen's off-key \"Whoa-no!\" just as the guitar comes back in 1:56...   it settles down and Jerry, at 2:30 seems to say get ready to live.... but nothing like the note of foreshadowing at 2:43...  Then, after listening to so many, I realized this is one of the few versions where he stays on the high note at 2:49... and keeps teasing it.  my favorite part in the whole piece is the double bend at 2:53... more descending scales... Drum change at 3:08... the another peak to the two note riff at 3:31...  back and forth... absolutely incredible how it all fits together.\n\nI can go to sleep now content...",

      "review_text": "Very nice DS and Eleven ... and a good solid Dew for 69.  TC's contributions are evident throughout.  Even the feedback in DS sounds right there.  The 11 is solid, with one of the longest intro jams.  I wish they hadn't stopped playing New Potato Caboose by this time; it could have taken up some of the excessive 37 minutes devoted to Lovelight.",

      "review_text": "it was fantastic!  14th and Peachtree was our Haight Ashbury, complete with a park at the end of 14th.  The Atlanta scene hadn't deteriated yet.  Word came the Grateful Dead were going to show up at the Park.  Of course everybody went.   Joe South, Delany and Bonny were cool,  but everybody was waiting for the Dead.  Purple Judy came by with a hand full of acid.  \"Where did you get these?\"  \"A guy has a big jar and is passing  them out.\"  I took two.  The Dead had set up in a picnic pavilion and I was standing in front about 4 feet away from Jerry, eye contact totally tuned in for minutes, hours, eternities before he broke away and tuned into others.   Everybody was tripping high vibe.  Somebody spiked  the cops' Coke and giving one cop piggy back rides, while he was shouting, \"I don't have to do this anymore!\"  Those days it wasn't like going to see somebody famous.  It was like  going to see extended members of a very hip family which we appreciate, experience and enjoy.  Wishing y'all peace and lots of love in your lives.",

      "review_text": "A classic 5 star show The Dead were making up a gig they weren't able to play earlier in the year. They must've felt pretty bad about it because when they came back (in the middle of some midwest dates no doubt), they didn't hold up. At all.\n\nWhat more can be said. This is top-shelf, vintage Grateful Dead. Go give it a listen. The love light in particular is the best I\u2019ve ever heard. ",
