Garcia had stated many times both roosevelt and the stanley were one of their favorite venues to play.As a matter of fact in 1972 they were supposed to play only the July 18th stadium show.They loved it so much that they played four more dates in Jersey city during the later part of September.As I have been going to dead shows since 1971 and live 5 minutes from where Roosvelt Stadium once stood I was lucky enough to see all of these shows.they were always on the top of their game evey time they played here and this show is no exception. The Sugaree and scarlet in the first set can't be touched as Well as the Help and wheel of the second set.",

The recording quality is fairly erratic, bassy and multiple AUD patches which are a little unsettling at first, but the show was a hot one. The whole show was a highlight, but the best were Sugaree, Loser, Scarlet Begonias, Help>Slip>Franklin's and The Other One. Between sets there was actually a trained chimpanzee  performing on stage and his handler pleading with the crowd on the field  \"not to throw things at Mr. Jiggs\". How could I not go back after a show like this? And the long strange trip continues...\n5 for the show, not the sound quality.",

Was not close enough to the stage to see mr jiggs but dont doubt his bizarre performance. This show was originally scheduled for an earlier date due to a mishap at roosevelt stadium at a Yes concert about a month before, as i recall a couple of large mirrors that were on the side of the stage apparently fell or blew off causing some serious damage to a few concertgoers- I was at that show as well. Also i believe there was some real bad weather the day of the original show and that may have had something to do with the postponement. Nevertheless, i had a ball with my 1st hi school sweetheart who was a big deadhead at this show and i'll not soon forget the odyssey we took to get there that day and home to her portchester house right afterwards! and, coincidentally, my 2nd show was Cameron Indoor!",

My buddy and me were sitting next to a guy who looked just like Sonny Bono. Poor Mr. Jiggs! He was getting pounded with light stix and change. He actually fell over on his roller skates a couple of times which prompted the trainer to yell the famous \"please don't throw anything at Mr. Jiggs\" line. The band was smoking this day. They were much better than when I saw them at the Capitol in June of the same year. I later found out that Garcia was sick during those shows so I'll give them a pass. This show was great and good to hear again. This was my fourth time seeing these guys at Roosevelt. Great every time.",

Sometimes soundboards lack audience noise all together, which to me is important. It's part of the energy.\n\nThe second set Help>Slip>Frank>Dancin'>Wheel>S&D has the audience hootin' and howlin'. Great energy through this segment especially. Very audible Phil bombs and Bobby twangs. The drum fills are absurd and you can tell that the rhythm devils are still getting used to functioning as a unit, and are overdoing there presence... in a good way. \n\nGreat recording of a great period in Dead history.",

      "review_text": "The Fox strikes again! This is DEFINITELY the dead at the top of their game.  As a previous reviewer wrote, the band (Jerr-Bear especially!) *LOVED* playing this venue.  It was a favorite.\n\nSome criticize 76' as being \"too mellow\"; granted, it doesn't have the spiking ferocity of 68' or 69' (or even 1970 for that matter!), but 1976 is in a LEAGUE of its own.  Dead base rates this show as 11th of the year and 508th of all time great (GRATE?) shows.  I have to respectfully disagree.  I am *not* saying this is the best show of the year, but you Phil lovers are going to be in the zone in this one!\n\nHighlights are DEFINITELY the Help-Slip-Frank combo (c-c-c-c-c-COMBO!)  \n\nThe 14 minute Sugaree is no slouch either; and although I prefer earlier (\"raw-er\" sounding \"Loser\"s,) this one isn't half bad.  Hell, it's not even 3/4ths bad! :)  The Wheel is always a must in 76'.  The only thing this show is missing to make it a TRUE top 5 contender for the year was the \"Mission in the Rain\", and as many of you true heads know, it was played (by the dead, NOT JGB!) a mere 5 times, all in 76'.  The dates this GEM was played were as follows:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n06/04/76- Paramount Theater - Portland, OR\n06/10/76- Boston Music Hall - Boston, MA\n06/12/76- Boston Music Hall - Boston, MA\n06/18/76- Capitol Theater - Passaic, NJ\n06/29/76- Auditorium Theater - Chicago, IL\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn my VERY humble opinion, the 06/29/76 version (last time played by the dead,) was the absolute best version.  It was almost like they perfected it to such a degree that there was no reason to ever play it again.\n\nGETTING BACK TO THIS SHOW:\n\n5 star songs:\nHelp-Slip=Frank!!! *****\nSugaree *****\n\n4 star songs\nLoser ****\nWheel ****\nIt Must Have Been The Roses ****\n\nEverything else is at LEAST a three star song, with the SOLE exception of the encore (Johnny B. Goode to end a show like THIS?!?)  I would lean towards five stars if they encored with a Brokedown or something of similar ilk; however, unlike a lot of reviewers on this site, I'll tell you how it really is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSOUND: 5\nSHOW: 4.5\n\"Dead\" Factor: 4.5\n\"Jam\" Factor (smooth as silk throughout): 5\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo, not to be stingy, (I wish they had half star ratings,) the encore killed this show for me, but: bottom line- do you want it??  YES!  Do you NEED it??!?  YES!  Is it a top 10 desert island pick?!?  Close, but, sadly... no. :(  \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-----> Therefore, 4 stars overall. <------\n----->  **** STARS (4 stars) ****  <------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nps- from now on, I will MIRROR *ALL* my archive reviews at http://setlists.net/\n\npps- this is still top ten, despite deadbase's review, if you can get a *CLEAN* SBD of this show, preferably a CM version, then, by all means, DO IT!!!!\n\nSLY in GREEN, FOXY in KIND,\n(sig,fik,),\n-=GREENFoX / aka / Jerryinapouch\n\n(email for kind heads lookin'for this show?):\nmightythefox@hotmail.(REMOVEFORSPAMROBOTS).com\n\nGet it?   Just remove the \"(REMOVEFORSPAMROBOTS) part and that's how you reach me. ;)  Peace.\n\nSincerely,\n-=Greenfox.",

Conned our way backstage, presenting ourselves as if from some sound system company.  \nBelieve it or not, there are some videos (from film)of this show on youtube !\nAlso, someone has posted a few photos from the event  on the net at http://jranderson.photoshelter.com/gallery/Grateful-Dead-1976-08-04-Roosevelt-Stadium-NJ-Before-the-Show/G00000umtgKcqZJA/P0000vqGLEGDVehw .\nWhat a blast!\nI'm bummed I can't download the files!\n-- david",
