Just a ferocious first set.  This Dark Star is right up there with 2/28 as one of my favorites for the year.  \nMy hope is that, in light of the fact that the Fillmore Box Set is a limited release, that once the 10,000 copies are sold, Archive will put the 2/27-3/2 shows back up.

LOL. But seriously (mostly) this show has been with me for years, from tape, to a hissy SBD on CD a few years ago - and now this great amazingly cleaned-up version. The 'ol Doctor has this one cranked up right now, with plenty of treble, what the hell, and NOOOO hiss (excepting 36 yr. old analog). Thanks Mr. Wizard!!\nThis classic show begins in an acoustic style, with a flawless Dupree's followed by a Mountains that just stops you in your tracks, it's so beautifully delivered.\nThe seque into Dark Star is seamless. And what a Dark Star!! Only a week away from THE Dark Star - 2/27/69 selected for Live Dead. They jam on the theme for over 15 minutes, very mellow and Haight-Ashbury 69 afternoonish, if you can dig it. And what a SBD! Everything to my ears is in balance, Pig, Jerry, Mickey's percussion, Phil - all sharing the mix well.\nDream Bowl?? Yeah, I reckon!! You'd have thought you were dreaming if you were about 6th row back when Jerry starts his fuzzed out runs halfway through Dark Star. The middle section is a kaliedoscope of changing themes and colors that keeps you on your aural toes (??) A stellar version that will remain one of favorite 69 Dark Stars.\nLike surprises? Get ready, because instead of launching forward into St. Stephen as usual, they count off Cryptical, the bus stops by, and you get on, or OFF as the case may be, ha ha.\nThis, plus a killer Death Don't (excuse the pun) makes Set One almost unbeatable! Which is the only complaint I have against this show - they didn't leave themselves much to do in Set Two. Well, almost.\nA strong Doin That Rag begins the set, with a great vocal performance from Jerry and a hot solo at the end. Then St. Stephen starts out of nowhere, and while it's also good, the star of Set Two is this version of The Eleven. At over 17 minutes, they take those 11 beats to the edge of the cosmos and back again! Garcia's leads are fluid and exciting. The drum work at the end, an exercise in precision.\nAt this point, they only have two choices left - either set off fireworks or let Pig do Lovelight, which is safer, sort of !?!\nA must have 1969 show from one of the Band's peak periods, Spring 1969.\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I know that we are \"lucky\" to anything from this time, but the fact is there are much better circulating SBD's during this era.  This should sounds completely muffled.  \n\nAnd as a result one can't enjoy the transitions between the songs as well, because the music is muffled.  I'm going back and forth between all of the Dark Stars from 1969 and 1970 on my iTunes and this one is not the best, by a long shot.\n\nI'm still listening to the show to see how it shapes out, but I can't think that this is, sound quality, average.",

Do you have a lossless circulation or are you just streaming the low-bandwidth version archive is hosting?\n\nI have the SBD of this show on my computer, and although I'm not at my station to play it right now, I don't think it's a very muffled recording.  Of course many early Dead shows don't sound as clean as later decades, but I think it's very difficult to have genuine complaints about the sound quality of many of the '69 shows in circulation, and I think this is one of those shows.\n\nI think this is a great show, but by no means a great example of how epic '69 was.",

These 2 shows at this bowling alley are a smoking warm up for the 2/27-3/2 Fillmore shows for the remaining recordings for Live/Dead.  They stand solidly on their own merits and capture the band at a peak moment that lasted for only a few months more -- perhaps until the Ark shows in Boston.  After that, they start to transition gradually, incorporating more of the folk/county western elements into their shows.  But for pure psychedelic mayhem, this period from late 68 to spring 69 is one of the band's major, (maybe most important -- I don't know) high points (no pun intended).",
