On the other hand, Jerry and Bruce were born to play together and -- when you throw Branford Marsalis into the mix, and stir it together for an entire show -- something big is gonna happen.\nThis show SMOKES! Shakedown, High Time, Franklin's Tower, and Estimated Prophet are versions for the ages, just about everything else is merely breathtaking, Jerry's voice and energy level are \"on\", and the recording quality of this board is nothing short of spectacular.  Each player/instrument is perfectly blended in the mix, the stereo separation, dynamic range, and imaging are excellent, and each lead gets its proper aural showcase as it appears.  I've been doing a bit of downloading lately, but my *listening* queue is completely hosed up because I can't seem to pry these discs from my player!\n\nYikes.  This is a top 10 show, maybe a top 5 (yes, of all-time).  What are you waiting for? Get it!",

      "review_text": "A night of nights Anyone whos reading reviews or downloading from this site knows that the Grateful Dead were the only ones who did that they did, not the best. On this particular night, they were the best band in the entire world playing at that moment in time. There is no question about it.\nEvery version is one for the ages. Listen to Jerrys relationship with the song High Time, he sings it with a sage sort of weathered beautiful wisdom that can only be sung from 20 years of getting to know a tune. The band also knows what Jerry means and the playing reflects it. Brandford and Bruces contribution are first rate, subtle yet assertive. \nI'll say it. This is one of the top 10 Grateful Dead concerts of all time. They knew it when they were playing it. \nBobby's verile assertions on Estimated Prophet and Black Throated wind capture the real American zen cowboy ethic that Weir/Barlow were so good at portraying. They dance elegantly between the Garcia/Hunter epics Shakedown Street and Dark Star, respectively.\nI could go on, just download this show. If you are an uptight 70's only GD collector do yourself a favor and humble your innards. \n\nThanks for this upload, the sound quality is an A+.",

This is the first show that I've downloaded from the 1980s and 1990s, which from a 70s freak is testimony in itself to the quality of the playing. Incidentally, when I burnt my CD of the show I moved Help On The Way>>>Franklin (which opened set 2) to disk 3 (along with the encore),to allow the 74 mins of Estimated>>> Turn On to run uninterrupted on a single CD (disk 2). Such a practice will not be to everyone's tastes, but it makes disk 2 a great listen",

What do you get when you mesh 3 genius bandleaders (Jerry, Bruce, and Branford)(Sorry Bobby, I am a fan of your playing but I don't include you in this particular category) with the greatest rock and roll band of all time?  Why, you get an inspired show like this of course!  This is a treat to listen to.  The sound quality is top-notch.  You can hear the literal and musical smiles that the musicians trade on stage.  Listen to such nuggets as Branford and Bruce chasing each other around in a game of musical cat and mouse while Jerry soulfully sings High Time, Jerry, Bruce, and Branford all pushing each other on the Slipknot, Bruce's runs on the Takes Alot to Laugh, and the Branford jam and nuclear Bobby in Lovelight.

In help/frank/slip he slips a gear and shoots the show into overdrive... \n\nLets face facts folks - you've downloaded the show are reading this to get a little more spice while you're listening, well consider this: listen to the beginning of help on the way if you want a serious lesson in group improvisation... wow...",

Its not about how the band plays as an octet or how Vince 'gets' or doesnt 'get' Dark Star.  Sorry others feel that way.  This is such a clear recording of a special performance, one that began circulating at a time when Bruce was kicking Jerry in the tail and pushing the band to greater limits.  Limits only surpassed with the presence of Branford.  I might agree that the other Branford shows have more sizzle than this one, but 9/10 is a superior recording to the '90 shows IMO.  I'm sure I could benefit from a listen to all the Branford shows this weekend and revise this later...",

      "review_text": "Over-rated ...Over-rated ... Over-rated I must file a dissenting opinion regarding what I believe to be one of the most overrated shows of the 90s.  I am a firm believer in rating a show on its own merits and of avoiding comparisons to other eras.  However, in this case, it is hard NOT to put this show up against the other Marsalis shows, particularly the first two, 3/29/90 and 12/31/90.  When done, you will no doubt conclude this is by far the weakest of the three (I'm not including 12/10/93 or 12/16/94) and a perfect illustration of the axiom that the whole is less than the sum of the parts.\n\nOn paper, this show should be a slam dunk.  Middle of a long MSG run, killer set list, and the aforementioned Mr. Marsalis; however, the sonic landscape often seems cluttered, the players unable to find where to space themselves within the broader context of the music.  Whereas the Nassau '90 show perfectly showed how improvisation is done, riffs and leads weaving between Garcia, Marsalis and Mydland (check out the Eyes and Estimated on that set for specific reference), here, everyone seems to want to jump in the pool at the same time, limiting the sound of each while muddling the music generally.  This is particularly true on the Estimated Prophet, where Vince (more on him later) seems to be clashing, as opposed to complementing, Marsalis in the outro jam.  This is a situation where 8 players are at least one, possibly two, too many.  Most songs would have been better performed had Bruce sat out and just allowed Vince to take the key part, or vice versa, or Branford passing on some leads.  A song like High Time, which would have benefitted from a shimmering sax solo is just a flaccid bore because no one seems to want to step away and let someone else take the lead.\n\nI have to reserve a separate criticism for Vince.  Now I'm usually one to come to Vincenzo's defense, he wasn't that bad, the last 18 months were more about Jerry's declining health than Vince's poor playing, etc ... however, here, his limitations, not as a musician, but as an interpreter of the Dead's music are glaring.  This is particularly true on Dark Star, where he apparently never learned anything other than the basic chord pattern.  He either never \"got\" or never got around to listening to quality Dark Stars because his limited knowledge/creativity ends up dragging the whole number down.  I would add Slipknot to that criticism, another place where you would think the music practically BEGGED for long, creative, jazzy riffs, never seems to get going.  There were just certain tunes Vince not only added little, but TOOK AWAY from the song, unfortunately, with a talent like Marsalis on the stage, Vince's shortcomings were just that much more magnified.  \n\nI don't want to completely flame this show, there are a few bright spots like Shakedown, CC Rider/Train to Cry, and for me at least, the Franklin's Tower (the one number where leads where passed around generously); however, those highlights are far outweighed by the remainder of the show, where the octet just never seems to figure out a comfortable groove and the jams just never happen.  Not only does this pale in comparison to the prior Branford shows (any head who does not own a copy of 3/29/90 and have the 2d set memorized has something wrong with them) but is mediocare in relation to the rest of this tour and certainly the other tours from 1991.\n\nThis is *still* and will always be a 2 star effort in my book.",

IMHO, Spring, Summer, and West Coast Fall of 1991 offered better played and better energy versions of every tune played this evening (with the possible exception of Dark Star just b/c I think every one is it's own world). Guest musicians, what Deadbase says, and whether you have the personal bias of having been there is meaningless, what I care about and what I review on the site is how good it is when I listen now, not whether I was there or whether Branford was there. If everyone is in agreement that 3-29-90 is a 5 star show(which I agree with), and that this night is NO 3-29-90 (which I also agree with), then this is less than 5 stars, hence my 4 star rating. Some 5 star 1991 shows in my opinion: 6-17-91, 5-10-91, 6-25-91, 4-1-91.",

Can't exactly put my finger on it, but it just sounds a bit hollow and empty of the heat with which it ws played.\n\nWhich is pretty much my take on the 90's anyway...  I've always thought that Brent's passing did something to Jerry.  You can't blame it all on the drugs and illness.  Seems that the blistering guitar licks and mega soul vocals so evident in '89 was just never there again...after the Spring of '90.  Saw many shows in 90-91...not as many in the next few years, but it never was the same.  Meaning Jerry never was the same.\n\nAnyway...sorry.  I could go on and on.  The recording is clear and good enough, but souless, and the show was excellent.  But I would never want to put this on for somone not in the know, and say \"this is the Dead...\"  Worth the DL for posterity alone.",

I'm not sure if that comes down to the mixing itself, or the fact that the band has Jerry soloing, Branford soloing, Bruce soloing, etc.  In some ways, it's almost too much of a good thing-- though the band is no doubt enthusiastic.  In my very humble opinion, though, Branford sounds a little out of place on some of the tunes.  Whereas he's amazing on Eyes of the World in the legendary 3/29/90 show, here he just sounds too jazzy at times, like on Black Throated Wind.",

Yeah the recordings rarely do a show justice you can debate about the mix and how differences affect the listening experience but overall this show is RED HOT. A lot of folks now wanna schwag the 90's but on an on night the boys were still making some of the best music ever.

Shakedown>cc>train, high time, cassidy, deal, SOTM could be the best played versions of all time.  HSF>est>dark star was incredible! The jamming was so intense i could not move, just stand there in utter awe of the sound coming out.  I was at the first 7 shows of this tour and i thought 9-4 could not be topped!  I get tired of people who can't stand 90's dead.  The stuff with hornsby is incredible and he put life back into Jerry by challenging him on stage. This IS the best show of the 90' from start to finish, nothing else compares.  I realize this is just my opinion, but to say this show is overrated is just nonsense.",

The performance is too cluttered with instruments and I dont think Branford really adds too much on this night. Hornsby would have been enough. Its not what the Dead play its how they play it. I'm sure you've all heard that one before, and it applies on this night as well. The show is a bit overated but still worthy of a download.",

The Dead have always had a tendency toward the looseness of a jazzy groove; it makes me happy to find it prominent and revisited here.  \n\nIt can be stated that this is a top-notch, late '91 glossy-tight show.  It may seem muddled to some ears but my take is that it's 8 musicians playing at once.  I can assume if I was in that house it would have sounded just perfectly fine.  '91 is a legendary year with Hornsby sitting in; I agree with all who declare he rallied this Band back up to old standards from years of lore.  Rock on.  We Are Everywhere.",

      "review_text": "Awesome Night This was my third show and all at MSG.  I was forutunate enough to have traded a ticket for the night before to a guy named Dave for some EXCELLENT paper.  I also had an extra for this night so I went in search of Dave once again.  I found Dave and found out at the set break that he was a massage therapist and knew the head of security at MSG, so we spent the second set as close to the stage as you can get right in front of Phil.  Although I only saw the boys 8 times in the 90's this was the only time Jerry seemed to be having fun.  Jerry would glance between Brnanford and Bruce and just smile and jam away.  I thought Bobby was going to get electrocuted the way he was spitting in his mic during Estimated.  Standing on the Moon was priceless.  And to witness a Help>Slip>Frank from the first row, WOW!  I am in no way an expert on The Gratefuld Dead but this was one of the best times of my entire life. Phil could be higher in the mix, but that is my opinion for 75% of the shows I have listened to on the archive.",

      "review_text": "5 stars all the way... How someone could rate this less than 5 is a mystery to me. This is a 5 star show all the way for me, a desert island disc for sure. In fact, I rank this as the best post Keith and Donna show and rank the Help>Slip>Franklins as one of the ultimate expressions of the GD magic, EVER. Check out Phil on the Help. Jerry, Bruce and Branford contribute to an acid drenched and quite jazzy version of Slipknot, shades of Bitches Brew era Miles Davis. They take their time with Franklins Tower, everybody gets a chance to shine.  \nNow for the very few flaws in this performance- While Bruce brought some great chops to the table and definately got Jerry fired up, he can be overbearing at times. And Vince stumbles on occasion (Estimated \"sax\", Dark Star organ). Like others have mentioned, the sound is a bit cluttered at points, to be expected with 8 musicians onstage. \nBut that is a small price to play for the breathtaking heights that this show reaches. Every song played here is an all time version, with the exception of Dark Star and Lovelight, and thats only cuz of the epic versions of these tunes they tossed off in the 60s-early 70s.\nGrateful Dead music just doesn't get any better than this.\nAnd for the record, this show absolutely CRUSHES 12-31-90 and is better overall than 3-29-90(except for the Eyes of course).",

It's just a ridiculously hot meeting of musical minds w/Branford and Bruce totally locked in and given plenty of room to add color and nuance and power to every song.\n\nEspecially awesome is the \"Shakedown\", \"Help>Slip>Tower\" trio, a lovely jazzy \"Dark Star\" and a beautiful bluesy \"Takes a Lot to Laugh\" that finds Jerry in fine vocal form, even at this late date in the band's history.\n\nAn amazing performance all around, and this coming from a head who believes the band peaked (consistency-wise anyway) in 1977.",

      "review_text": "Dark Star Quest Ends I returned to seeing the Dead after a 5 year layoff after they broke out Dark Star in Hampton in 1990 and finally caught a Dark Star on this night after my God, it must be 90 shows and 12 years.\n\nEverybody reviewing this show seems hell-bent on comparing this show to either the previous two Branford shows or their 'era of choice'. That's silly to me although I was hung up on that sh*t myself for years. Must we always look at better or best? Can't we just enjoy each show as the piece of art it was intended to be?\n\nPersonally, I went to over 20% of my entire Dead concerts in a two month period (March '81-May '81, 21 shows) and thought many of them incredibly average. Now listening to them, I'm shocked at how great they were night after night. Man, what I missed out on being picky! NO MORE!\n\nWell anyhow, I guess I'll add my $.02 now lol.\n\nI thought that it was indeed the lesser of the three Branford shows even though I was there and my quest for The Holy Grail (Dark Star) ended that night and with Branford no less. That doesn't change the facts. I knew it that night. I knew it when I heard the cassette a few weeks later. I knew it when I got the SBD on CD. I know it now listening. Personally, I like 12/31/90 best. Love the Dark Star > Too > Dark Star > TOO mixture. And, NFA is the best in years.\n\nWell, you know the rest about this show. What's not to like other than Bob cuts off Estimated as usual for this era (80-81 is Estimated's peak).\n\nThe whole first set is great as the band rolls through just about every musical genre out there but country: funk (Shakedown); Blues (Rider > Train);  folksy homespun ballads (Wind, High Time) Jazz (Cassidy); and rocking out (Deal) with great improv, group mind and vigor. Help > Slip > Franklin's is a tour de force as well.\n\nDark Star part 1 was good but not great, but I loved it anyhow.\n\nThe best part in my opinion is the space jam after verse two of Dark Star. Jerry and Branford trading horn sounds. Awesome stuff. In my 14 years of seeing the Dead, this was one of the three best improvisational things I saw the Dead do, along with the famous jam after He's Gone on 5/6/81 and the 20 minute Other One on 4/23/83.\n\nAnd.. Oh yeah.. It's a five. :^)",
