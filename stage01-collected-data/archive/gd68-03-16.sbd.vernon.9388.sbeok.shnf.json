So this show indeed ended up as part of Anthem of the Sun, though I haven't yet figured out what songs were used. And the song that Phil stops playing in turns out to be Caution at roughly the 4-minute mark.  \n\nAs for the playing, I think that the show is mostly great, though I strongly disagree that this is one of the greatest Elevens ever. Overextended by at least 5 minutes, the band just flails around aimlessly starting around 9:30, trying to pick up an individual theme but it seems that no one is up to the challenge, so the jam simply peters out WAY too late, with Jerry steering them into a good Schoolgirl with some really good Pig (gotta love his harp solos). The second set is good, though I agree the cut in Cryptical is a buzzkill. Excellent Other One and a smoking Alligator jam. \n\nAs for the sound quality, it's not the greatest-- somewhat hissy and muddy, and nowhere close to the clarity of 2/14, 10/12 or 10/20 but quite listenable and should be of no problem to fans of this era like me.",

But, having listened to the stream, I can't see how it fits before Hurts me too.. something about it doesn't strike me as correct, I guess, placing it there.  Two songs in a row with distinct stoppages (Crowd clapping)?  \n\nWhat I consider in favor of AM Dew coming before DS... 1 - The sound levels are up and down.  This may be on the tape, but it strikes me as appropriate that if it's not the source, but the taper, that they'd mess with levels on the 1st song.\n2 - Reviewing Deadlists set lists for shows in the same general time period reveals that AM Dew was often a 1st set song, and several times came before Dark Star.\n\nAll that said, I really don't have any \"authority\" other than my instinct here, so take it for what it's worth.  \n\nGreat show, by the way.  I think the Gator is not as solid as 2/14/68 (My favorite show (or maybe second behind 2/14/70)) but it's pretty close.\n\nFurthermore, upon a closer listen, the notes before Hurts me too are clearly Clementine.",

      "review_text": "First performance of We Bid You Good Night This is the first performance of We Bid You Goodnight, which is as evocative of the late \u201860\u2019s Dead as anything. I remember at Jerry\u2019s memorial in Golden Gate Park in 1995, the large crowd became silent when Goodnight from one of these shows came over the sound system.\n\nNice Dark Star. Jerry stumbles at the start of China Cat, then stumbles again on guitar just before the final vocals start. But otherwise, a fine effort in the style of China Cats of this period. This was one of the last times they played it before dropping it for almost year, replacing it with St. Steven.\n\nBut the first unfortunate cut of this tape is the end of China Cat, so we don\u2019t have the transition to the Eleven. The Eleven has a bit different feel than others of this period, more bounce and less high-voltage. At several points it almost sounds as if they\u2019re about to go into Goin\u2019 Down the Road. Phil does some fine work here. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best of the year, but it is good.\n\nThis is a good Schoolgirl. Pigpen\u2019s harp and vocals sound great and Jerry is in the zone, though it does go on a few minutes too long.\n\nThis is one of the shows used in Anthem of the Sun. It spounds like portions of The Other One may have been used, maybe a bit of Alligator but that\u2019s just a guess. But the reprise of Cryptical--Arggh! The jam is cut from the recording. Argh, I say. The beginning of Alligator is also missing. But the Alligator jam is fast-paced and electric, as is Caution. That latter is peppered with Pigpen on harp and is, at times, pure dynomite. Then, ARGHHH! Another cut: the transition into feedback is missing. Argh, indeed.\n\nDew aficionados, take note: this a very good Morning Dew, with Jerry and Phil dancing together instrumentally. I agree that it was probably at the beginning of the show, and not an encore after Good Night.\n\nEven with the exasperating cuts, a fine Anthem-era show, though the February shows were a bit better.",

      "review_text": "Becoming Jerry Garcia OK, I'm gonna get a little historical on all y'all right now.  As I've been enjoying all the concerts posted in this way-back machine the last couple of months, I've realized two important things.  First, Jerry reached a point in his development as a musician where he started sounding like the Jerry Garcia the world would come to know starting in the early 1970's.  Starting out, his style was more straight ahead electric blues, thrilling quite often and exploratory, but not with the level of innovation that came later.  When did that come?  It evolved, starting at around this time, I believe.  I've listened very closely from 1967 on.  By 1969 his later style was firmly in place and polished to a great degree.  But it didn't seem to emerge until spring of '68.  I can start to hear it in the dark stars and in this alligator.  It's not all there yet.  There are solo stretches that are repetitive and there are thematic ideas that are not finished, as he would accomplish later.  But as I continue listening it seems that he develops a new style in concerts in the spring and through June 1968.  Then there is two months until they come back in August, when for the first time, to my ear, he sounds like the Jerry who would become known as one of the greatest ever.  I would love to find out what happened in the summer of '68 that led him to develop his style to where it became distinct in a new way.  The other thing that has me thinking, which I need to explore some more, is the Dead's transition from electric blues to their Workingman's/Beauty era.  That probably has been discussed hereabouts a lot, but (as someone who was turned on to the Dead in 1972 in my late teens) I consider songs from that era to be utterly original and a true and major contribution to the great American songbook.",

So I'm going by the author's take and any archival library content I can find-like everyone else who wasn't there and taking notes-I use Deadbase, DeadLists & You Tube for my research and fact confirmation. What else can you do if you weren't there? \nI try to stay away from Set list disputes because I wasn't there. I know shows must have gotten jumbled up and mislabeled & destroyed & then again, there are so many shows that have no sets listed at all! \nAnyway, [This] show rocks, chock full of goodies & I believe, after all of my petty nitt-picking, here is a show that brings together all of the elements of the bands core structure & though formless most of the time, peaks in some enormous spots; giving Pig room to work; with great harmonica & presence, he seems to push his way right to the front of the song-maybe he intimidated Jerry a little(speculative); but, maybe some conversations had been had about set lists & how to get even further into the audience's psyche. As a stage musician myself, I do notice when people are interested & when to throw in that song that will lure them further down the rabbit hole, where we can all take the same trip & reciprocate the vibe- that kind of thing won't happen unless you're doing it show after show- this is only March 16, 1968 & they'd only been at it for a couple of years solid. You can tell iron is being worked with fire and hammer & The Grateful Dead are a force to be reckoned. Imitated more times than can be counted, but, listen and you will know, this band is the real deal.",

I listened to, and taped (four 90-minute cassettes)every second, from Scott Muni's interview with Bill Graham through the fantastic NRPS set and the two Dead sets.\n\nWhen I finally saw them live, March of '73, it was a disappointment. Pig had just died. I could barely make them out from the far end of the 15,000 seat Nassau Coliseum. I saw them probably less than a dozen times, up until the early '80's, and they never lived up to the old tapes and records.\n\nYet I'm a Dead Head. Have been since '71, and I listen to them here at the archive every day.",

      "review_text": "RE: The Eleven Listening to this show again after a long break from '68. \n\nThe Dark Star>China Cat>Eleven I find for the most part to be very inspired for this period. I disagree somewhat about the Eleven and the band \"flailing about\" - the jam definitely does meander somewhat, but overall I find there is a lot of excellent interplay between Garcia and Lesh, with Jerry turning up the flames a bit towards the end of the jam. Probably not one of the best versions ever, but very nice and unique.\n\nThere is certainly no debate when it comes to this Alligator though - it could be even better than 2/14/68, and is easily one of the greatest of all time.",
