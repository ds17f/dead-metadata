Seamon's matrix recording is undoubtedly the best show for this bust out. It's not 100% perfect, with some airy patches of only AUD scattered about, but still totally worth the download as the best source. \n\nFirst set smokes in its entirety. And though there are some buzzing sounds during CR&S and Sailor>Saint, its still totally listen-able.  Don't Need Love is heart-wrenching and performed well, this song could have been a slick studio cut had it been practiced on more imho. UJB Drums Space wrap around is rare and a nice Playin' reprise out of space finishing up what the first night started. Dew set closer solidifies this an as \"on\" night, simply rip roarin'. \n\nThanks for restoring this show the best you could! Sounds great!",

      "review_text": "Thank you Thanks for putting this out there. I have never been one to \"review\" a show, but of the few I went to,  this is one that sticks out. I was 16 and  had \"left home\" to see string of shows.  The show was pretty mind blowing and I remember feeling lucky to get in. My friend had my ticket and we had gotten separated in our car caravan driving up from NH.  We had no real plan to meet, so I climbed a tree at the only entrance to get a good vantage point &  looked for his car as he drove in.  No myface, no email or cellphone. I found him, eventually. The venue was small and was like seeing the Dead in a high school gym  (it actually was a college gym, U of Maine).  Jerry seemed happy to be there. Show highlights...meeting Tom Constantine walking around, hanging with 2 older hippies that only saw the band in Maine(each had seen over 40 shows over the years), \"Jack a Roe\", Jerry's crispness and the feeling of being a little too high because every song in the second set sounded like \"Playing in the Band/Uncle Johns\" to me.  Great \"Cold Rain & Snow\" in which they were so out there, I forgot the tune for a minute or three.  There were more people trying to get in the show than were actually in the show itself.  Good times.  RIP Barry Sharkey.",

The Stranger opener is about the best I have ever heard. Lost/Saint only worked out really well at a few shows, and tonight was one of them (see also 1979-11-24). Bobby really gets into the last refrain (\"Sure don't know what I'm goin' for! What the fuck you gonna do?\"). Enjoy the 42:32 UJB>Drums>Space>PITB Reprise>UJB after some Brent cheesyness. Wrap that up with a Dew closer and a high-energy Good Lovin', and we'll call this one of the best shows of 1984.\n\nAs for the recording, I can't thank you enough Hunter. The sound quality is just exactly perfect.",

As is posted else where on this site, 10/12/84 change my life forever. Not to disrespect any of the great tapers out there but I always consider the Oades recording to be the most representative of the shows till I heard this recording. I always wondered what happened to the board copy that the end of the show was cut but I must say that you did great job with this mix. \n\nThis show deserves to be released and this Matrix proves to me that a worthy mix is attainable for a release.

I remember some folks who had engine trouble with their VW van,, They pushed it over on it's side in a ditch, removed the engine the first day, and had all back together and on the road by the second evening.  :)",

      "review_text": "A long crazy night This review is prompted to defend the honor of this show in much the same way fights in a playground start after someone ranks on someone else's Mom.\nI had pretty much assumed that this show was so far ahead of anything else that anyone would want to throw against it from 1984. (Yes, even the Berkeley D. Star show although if you put up a BCT show from November I could understand that)\nSo for the record I have the great pleasure of telling one and all this is the best show of 84.\nI am just sitting down to the Stranger and it is just a flat our jam and the rhythm in running on that Shakedown vibe. \nThis is also the recording you want to listen to this show with because Hunter S. has the sound mastered. I can hear the music clearly and I can also tell the crowd is going N-U-T-S.\nThat Stranger clocked in at a solid 10 minutes.\nSo what makes a hot show. How about after you dance your butt off for 10 minutes Jerry brings one of the sweetest ballads in the GD catalog.\nI don't have my Deadbase any more but as I recall 'Roses' was a pretty rare tune by this time.\nNow just listen to Jerry take his solo it is just dripping. \"All I know is I could not leave her there\" \nSo what you going to play Bobby. Oh I hear it already bouncing around the hall. A few heads picked up on it. And just for the record it is the final ON THE ROAD AGAIN. Now that is loose right there. Third song of 1st set. The Board messing with Bobby's vocals. Listen to the harmonies on this. Flashback 1980 Radio City.\nExcept this is electric and very feisty.\nSo Garcia what is your call? Crowd is already in a frenzy. zap! A double time JACK A ROE again if memory serves me not a common song in 84. Listen to the pace of this tune they are tearing it up. How fast can you dance to this? well you better get on it because train is leaving station, rocket leaving for Jupiter.\nIt is that contrast between Garcia's laid back vocals and the frantic pace of the song that get's me dancing.\nThe next tune is a nod to the Stones and they do Mick and the boys proud. I caught this tune at Meadowlands and folks were dancing so hard the security at Byrne had to turn their faces away for fear their plastic gear would melt thus encasing them forever with EVENT STAFF labeled to their foreheads.\nI love any tune where Jerry gets to belt out backing vocals example-Promised Land.\nListen to Brent on the Organ he is shucking and jiving it. Always had to half Step when he plays the organ. Weir taking a ride on the slide. Here comes Jerry. He just sounds awesome. And the group jam is tasty as well.\nNow the only thing I don't have yet is the Phil Zone but wait for it. here comes the Cumberland Blues. As a rule of thumb any show that I went to where Cumberland was played was a show with lots of Phil in the mix.\nI thought they were flying on the Jack-O-Roe just listen to the pace of this Cumberland. And here is the point where I think things really start to gel. First off the jamming is stellar , the vocals on the Cumberland are over the top it is like Brent and jerry are throwing themselves into the lyrics. Here comes Bob's verse. Nice harmonies Jerry's voice a little stressed but he is using what he has to full effect. Jerry is just tearing it up and Brent has switched over to a picking type piano sound almost like the train effect in old bluegrass tunes. (like in LET IT ROCK) \nSound dropped out on the back end of Cumberland\njust briefly. Sound back\nDang, MUSIC, so if you are not totally spent Bobby is going to pound you now. Not saying this is the best Music Never that I have heard, (Hersey P.A. probably my favorite of the 80's)\nBut the thing I always try to get a feel for is how is the Band playing and to me they are just bursting at the seams. I am not sure there is a way to measure shear volume but this MUSIC is fat.\nAnd Listen to Jerry he came to play tonight.\n2nd set. Why is there a difference between a Rain and Snow opener in 1st or 2nd set? I am not sure but the 2nd set opener just seems a bit more warm. Rain & Snow is one of the rare tunes that I enjoyed every time I heard it. It never seemed dated to me. This is a good choice for Garcia because he doesn't have to force his range.\nWhen everyone joins him on the backing vocals you can feel the place getting ready to blow!\n\"I married me a wife, been trouble all my life\"\nReminds me of Henny Youngman used to say, \"Take my wife, please\" they say the day Youngman's wife of over 60 years died in 1987 that was the last time Henny ever said that as part of his show.\nLost Sailor>Saint of Circumstance= This song coupled I always enjoyed. If you are a dancer this song just had great dance vibe to it. I might dance in the same spot for most of a show but when they played this tune I was off to the races.\nThe worst thing that ever happened was breaking up Sailor and Saint and even worse was giving up on Sailor because Saint was never the same after that.\nDon't no if you ever did this but I would break up songs into elements:\nCold Rain and Snow= SNOW\nSailor>Saint= RAIN\nDon't Need LOVE=ICE\nUMCLE JOHN'S BAND=SUNSHINE\nThere has been some static bouncing around during 2nd set. I think someone finally killed the Maine Coon as Brent plays Don't need Love.\nYou know this is the most bluesy Dead tune since Pigpen belted out the Stranger (Two Souls)\nSome folks tried to play up that Jerry hated this tune because when Brent played it pre-drumz then Jerry would duck out on it. I really think this was just a case of not much Garcia could do with the tune. anyway I think it finally got back to Garcia. And this night Jerry came back out and sat in on the tune and then guided the band into Uncle John's that my friends is why I treasure this show. It was Jerry Garcia coming along Brent and proclaiming \"I can hear your voice\" From this point on I felt like 900,000 tons of steel were lifted off Brent's chest.\nThe thing I now like about DON'T NEED LOVE is it is brutally honest. If you have been jilted this song captures the emotions you are left with. (even if it wasn't the easiest tune to hear live.)\nThis is a very special Uncle John's Band.(no words beyond that)\nThe jam into drumz is very nice!\nThe entire UJB clocking in a full 16 minutes the last three of which find Garcia doing some cool noodling. Almost like we are going to get a meltdown and then I am thinking maybe China Doll and yes a case could be made that P.I.T.B was in the offering as well but eventually we get the rhythm section. And Ten Minutes of donkey kicking boot stomping Drumming well more like 8 minutes and then two minutes of the beam and some of that electronic stuff. Now hope you didn't do something foolish like leave the hall for a soda/ bathroom break because the SPACE as Garcia said, 'was the most creative part of the show for him' he I referring of course to post 70's. And this Space finds the Boys off exploring that little bit of noodling they left us with Pre-drumz\nTo me there are hints of the Other One here but it is mostly Jerry riffing. This point in the show often reminded me of Jimmy Page doing that crazy stuff with his guitar and the violin bow.\nThe Space finally hits the Main Ten and we are off again. You know we didn't get those monster end of 1st set P.I.T.B in the 80's but I found the boys were extremely creative in weaving in and out of PLAYING. You got to love the way they are rallying around the tune yet at the same time heading off in different directions.\nThis is actually the REPRISE so I am not sure if this was a PLAYING from sometime else on this tour. (Note to self-P.I.T.B started the previous night 10/11/84-Augusta)\nHere is the REPRISE and it is rocking. Just bet you that some heads were puzzling that reprise and just to confuzzle a little more here comes the rare UNCLE JOHN'S RERISE. and by this time unless you are writing a setlist down you start thinking wow they are playing songs as I think of them. What did they play?=EVERYTHING!!! Here that DEW coming. Now it is Jerry's turn he has been playing his butt off all night now he is total center stage. Like PIGPEN back in the day. School is in session. This is JERRY GARCIA, this is why we went from town to town and around and around, to shake the hand that shook the hand. Something about Maine almost like it is detached from the madness of the East Coast. You can still look folks in the eye without starting a fight and shake someone's hand bone to bone. Anyway, a gigantic MORNING DEW with Jerry both playing and singing his tail off.\nMercifully the east coast rhythmic clapping is actually in time tonight. Pretty soulful. \n\"I guess it doesn't matter anyway\"\nEncore= GOOD LOVE--This just makes me tingle!!!\nHow high is the energy level at the end of this show. YOU COULD DRIVE ALL NIGHT TO HARTFORD AND ONLY BREATH ONCE.",

      "review_text": "Was many a first eight four <br />This tape had a healthy trading profile in the days of B&P. An AUD that held up well to dubbing made the trade popular, and it was sometimes the only '84 on tape lists. Today though, those who listen to more '84s have found better shows. The night before also shows up on lists with equal frequency, and though that's the better show, this was the night chosen for official release. It's a fine show, but given what's available today I wouldn't hedge it for a top five for the year. There are exciting parts and below-average parts. It's known mainly for having a Don't Need Love and the final On the Road Again. \n\nFirst Set. The middle of the 1st set has some historical value, but the bookends are better-played. Opener <i>Feel Like a Stranger</i> feels like mid-show. <i>It Must Have Been the Roses</i> is also in a weird place and is played well enough until \u2013 good gods \u2013 that solo! The year's top version (of only 5). There was only one <i>On the Road Again</i> in '84 and then it was put in the attic. It's an average version but, interestingly, 1983's lone example was in Maine too. The year's only <i>Jack-a-Roe</i> comes next and it's solid (it had been 2 years). <i>It's All Over Now</i> starts at a faster tempo than usual, though the beat falls out of the pocket by the end. The last pair are above average, particularly the <i>Cumberland</i>, but it's a short set.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Cold Rain & Snow</i> serves to warm them back up from the break. They were down to just five of <i>Lost Sailor</i> per year, and it's a tad rusty, albeit better than the clunky <i>Saint</i> that follows (granted \"Still can't see that old man southern sun/What  the fuck you gonna do\" is better than \"mebbe goin onna feeee/mebbe goin onna feeee/mebbe goin onna feeeee\"). The Brent rarity <i>Don't Need Love</i> has no business in this set position, but at least it doesn't go into Drums. This is the ninth, and one of the better ones, for this indifferently-arranged blue-eyed soul ballad. Jer and Bobby could never really find the melody (it's almost a vamp), and it was dropped shortly hereafter. The majorly-long start to <i>Uncle John's Band</i> is rough, but the jam is good fun (note the Blues for Allah nod @11min). <i>Drums</i> had somewhat petered out in '84, but here they are better than the fumfering <i>Space</i>. They had played <i>Playin'</i> the night before, and either this is a reprise or, probably, they evolved into it, remembered they had just played it, and so did only one verse. Though Jer does hit the riff, it barely forms for a long time \u2013 and that's the best part<b>:</b> mostly a jam, but when Jer is done Bobby's just starting, so it ends up a bit off and Jer heads back to <i>Uncle John's</i> (for which only a reprise is visited). It's mostly an average <i>Dew</i> \u2013 a bit sloppy, truth be told, until late, when Jer starts pulling rabbits regardless. On paper this set looks better than actuality; including the encore \u2013 which is ragged. Draggy and with shoes-in-the-dryer, the Heads are left with a trainwreck.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nIt Must Have Been the Roses \u2013 best of '84\n\nSOURCES: There's about a bazillion sources for this one, but the Seamons matrix outstrips them all \u2013 best image, excitement and a lack of cuts. Like SBD sources, it <u>needs -1% pitch correction</u> for the first set. A great, newer  AUD source is 143086-schoeps (most other AUDs run fast). The whole show is on <b>30 Trips</b>, with the first disc needing <u>-1% pitch</u>. <b>Definitive Live</b> has Feel Like a Stranger. Most of the show is usually up on YouTube, in poor qual.",

      "review_text": "19th Trip Around the Sun Hot first set and I absolutely love the song selection. The Stranger opener is featured on the 30 trips definitive live story. Rare and beautiful 84 Roses then follows. It's just one of five for the year, last played 23 shows prior on 6/14. The UJB-Drumz-PITB-UJB-Dew Sandwich is of course reminiscent of those 73 sandwiches- wildly different at the same time and punctuated by the 18 minutes of drums/space in between. This show is an easy top five pic for 1984. Actually tied at fifth with 4/1/84 (21 votes each) in Deadbase \"Favorite Tapes\" for the year. Voodoonola2's youtube video of the show is worth viewing. While it might be jarring for some to the eyes, really listen with your ears as Garcia is in total control.",

I'm a Brent guy and I know like Day Job I Don't Need Love is a bummer and we fans never really embraced it. But it's sad and beautiful and Brent's whole heart is in this one. Love you all. Miss you Jerry and Brent! Peace and love to all! 4 for recording and performance. Love the early-mid '80s",

I'm obsessed with Brent's \"Don't Need Love\", as it's emotional and super rare (even more rare with Jerry). If Brent's stuff is cheese, I'm a cheese head! Maybe I'm biased as my first 20 shows were with Brent, and last dozen were fill ins. None of the last dozen touched any of the Brent shows!",
