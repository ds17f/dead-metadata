I think I threw the frisbee for six straight hours before Patti Smith stepped on stage. I was drinking from a gallon jug of Who knows what. All I remember is a very loud Harley Davidson and Jerry's hair in pig-tails. And some chick asked me to put her on my shoulders to see this new guy on keyboards. I don't remember much music, but this recording is as good as it gets. Thanks Archive.org",

We were sitting at about the 50 yard line and it was really weird watching as all these people tried to make their way up front... including a guy on a motorcycle, stoned out of his mind, who ran over the leg of the guy next to me, and when the guy yelled, backed up and did it again!\n\nYou can find a scan of the flier for the event at \nhttp://www.geocities.com/bstateob/deadposter.jpg",

I don't remember the biker that others alluded too but me and my friends were happily spread out on blankets in the back of the crowd on the field.

I was a Freshman at UMass that year (Baker dorm), and friends with couple of the students on the booking committee who were also DeadHeads, and who booked the show.  We were completely freaked!!!!  I'm trying to remember how many classes I cut that semester from the sheer bong-fueled anticipation (probably more than I went to, judging by my grades that year ... )  I thought having Patti Smith was also brilliant.  (Not so warmly received by the rest of the crowd, though.)  This was the highlight of our year (pinned up against the front as we were : ) beautiful Spring day, just perfect weather, and I almost cried listening to Stella Blue just now for starters before having to drizzle all over the page right now.  I do have a vague recollection of the biker.  I also have photos somewhere of Patti Smith hanging off of the stage if anyone's so inclined.  Anyway, thank you for this.  What an unexpected delight.",

The prior reviewer must have let the years fog his memory -- the weather was far from beautiful.  It threatened rain all day, was quite overcase, and did indeed start to drizzle just as the show ended.  The weather for the next year's Spring Concert was much different; the Allmans played on a quite hot and sunny day, leading to a lot of drinking in the crowd and ultimately the cancellation of the next year's concert (to be cleverly re-branded \"Community Day\" and turn out to be a concert after all!).",

Every time we hit a bump the tires would rub against the wheel well and the car would shudder. We got there the night before the show and partied in the parking lot along with hundreds of other deadheads. I remember well the pieces of paper with the blue roses on them, oh how they made the show so great. I remember the biker very well, he drove right next to us and made his way to the front like he was the king of the show. The show was great I especially remember the space into the Fade Away into the Stella Blue. On the ride home we gave another person a ride home which didn't hepl the car or tires much. A trip I will always remember.",

The band was playing crazy it was so hot and he pushed right next to me with his bike, that's when I saw his wine flask tied to his bike. I grabbed my buck knife and cut it off the back, needless to say we drink his jug juice and enjoy the rest of the show. I still have that wine flask as a trophy from that show...",

And that Shakedown was incredibly salvaged after some pretty hilarious vocal flubs. Overall, this may be the catchiest show I have listened to in a while. Smoking, mellow, trippy, all of it. Ten stars!",

We had no tickets.  Did some drops on our eyelids from someone giving out of their tailgate of old Chevy.  Soo good.  The gates went down so did the rain and the Angels came in.  What a show ended up at a party in Pierpont Tower had a pizza on the road to the gorge where Michael and I shared the women and the wine with so beautiful Mary.  And yes Patty Smith was the warmup.  And my Buddy Michael was the guy up on the top of the the gate posts saying push push push..   Never forgetit..\nNobody got hurt just all nice.\n\nPS the disco dead actually sounded good",

It threatened to rain most of the morning until the Dead played \"Look's Like Rain\" - the sky cleared up, the sun came out  and the place went wild. \nPatty Smith was EXCELLENT !! \nThey sold about 10,000 tickets for this  UMass spring concert. About 40,000 people showed up. Bob Weir and one of the UMass officials nicely asked the audience if they could open the gates (which were on the verge of collapsing anyway from people climbing it) and declare it an open concert.  Everyone cheered and the rest of the day was  great music, beautiful skies and one big party !!!\n\"Gone are the days..........................\"",
