The Feb 75 tapes are all pretty loose and jammy, and it seems odd that the band would be performing something this complicated on their first night back in the saddle.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t have McNally\u2019s GD bio handy, but I believe he says that the first session at Ace\u2019s was by a local band (not the GD) on the night of a full moon, which would have been Jan 27 or Feb 26.\n\nThe music is sweet, if you dig these rehearsal recordings, which I do.  Wish there was more!",

This is a short recording but keep digging,\n\nThere are more as the years go on... they are called Ace Rehearsal\n\nCheck em out!!\n\nThanks to the hardcore papers that go to the work to track these recordings",
