While this Playin' is short, it is essential Dead. \nThe Truckin>Drums>Other One segment also contains some neat improvisation. The 23-minute Other One contains more melodic jamming than your typical '72 version, plus there is some space after the 2nd verse, though no transition is made (Wharf Rat could have easily segued out of it). Despite the lackluster recording quality, slow speed, and tedious between-song chatter, this show is worth picking up, especially for Other One fans.",

After the bass driven opening, the Dead jam HARD for about 2 minutes. It doesn't matter how many times I hear this type of jam from The Dead: I always get goose bumps as I pay homage to their shear mastery of their instruments as well as to their ingenuity and inventiveness of jam. There really was nothing like a Grateful Dead concert. All ya gotta do is listen and you'll have an epiphany as to just how good these guys were. This entire year is jam after jam of raging Grateful Dead. I suggest you own it all.",

      "review_text": "Not a tidbit What could be overlooked as not-a-real-show is as hot as the tour as a whole. Beat-Club is renowned because it was unique among TV shows in that - rather than have bands play a couple brief songs - it let them play their set (then selecting tracks for air). Which is, of course, perfect for the Dead, who came to Bremen ready to load-in, bring their madness to the studio crew & staff, and jam awhile (more than 90min).\n\nAfter warming up, taping started with a decent <i>Bertha</i> followed by a perfectly tight <i>Playin'</i> with minimal Donnaskreech\u2122. <i>Mr. Charlie</i> is likewise perfect (as almost every night on the tour). <i>Sugaree</i> has a false start and doesn't really take off. <i>One More Saturday Night</i> is way uptempo and, tempered by the setting, the conciseness fits the \tarrangement . They decide to  trust to reason and tape another <i>Playin'</i>, because they can. After a false \t\tstart (the CD notes say Bobby blew the line but, given his comment before, seems he sang \"treason\" purposefully. Not as adventurous as the first take  -  just more sitting on the wah. <i>Beat it on Down the Line-7</i> gets by but the winner is <i>Truckin'</i>. After a false start Jer does Mendelssohn's <i>Spring Song</i>. The story of the composer who faced antisemitism and became an Anglophile is interesting (read about Mendelssohn all from his works) but Jer apparently came to the riff the same way  as Merry-Go-Round Broke Down. The restart is tight as hell - one of the best ever, with wildfire solos. The same follows into a hot <i>The Other One</i>. You get to hear some Pig organ, swelling and breathing like it's playing THEM. After it winds down, the taping is done, but they just let it break down and diddle diddle diddle -  the formless dead that acolytes (and either you're a head or an acolyte) consistently fail  to grasp; but what you witness here is creation itself (okay...songwriting itself).\n\nGrade = A\n\nHighlights:\nPlaying in the Band - 1st one is nailed\nMr. Charlie - so on the dime and Jer varies each and every night\nOne More Saturday Night - brisk r-n-r\nTruckin' - tightest ever and Jer amazes\nThe Other One - both tight and extremely exploratory, taking advantage of the atmosphere\n\nSOURCES: The slow-pitched soundboard does no justice compared to the official release, but does have the two warm-up songs. The video portion is usually on Youtube. Only Saturday Night was used for the show and the official Beat-Club DVDs but a whole-show DVD circulates/sells. Both audio and video versions cut the banter in different places (Jer does a brief Teddy Bear's Picnic before BioDtL). Of all the boys' TV-studio appearances, this is perhaps the most entertaining because they have the  most freedom and they put out a focused, tight, yet progressive set (and melted down the staff). One of the most entertaining single discs of the steamer trunk box.",
