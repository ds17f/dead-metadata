This set was recorded by Jeff Silberman. He was the only person in the building recording digitally which allowed him to capture the extra long second set UNCUT. He did not record the first set as he was fighting the elements. Even Healys master tapes were cut due to the length of the 2nd set. Perhaps this is why there is no soundboard in circulation??? Regardless, this is the one to download if you want the complete set. You can get Jims first set if you like the sound better, but I think both are nearly identical. Both are 441s from the balcony, one is digital, the other analog. JY",

We'd been seeing shows for a few years already but always in the Metro NYC area - being from northern NJ and all. \n\nThen one day a month or two before this night a friend says, yeah the Dead's playin' in Saratoga. Someone says, \"I ain't going to Florida\" to see them. No man, SaraTOGA, in upstate NY. Well, the decision was made.\n\nFive of us - 3 buddies and my girlfried (who's now my wife)- left Northern NJ the night before, on her birthday no less, around 11. We had absolutely no clue what we'd find when we got there, no place to stay and no idea where the venue was except that it was in Saratoga.\n\nTwo and a half hours later we pull off the Northway and somehow wind up driving around Saratoga Lake eventually finding our way to Rt 9 and onto the Avenue of the Pines - a really cool road with towering pine trees on either side that runs through the edges of the State Park. \n\nWe come to a traffic light, contemplating which way to go - left, right or straight - when suddenly the cosmic gods tap us on the shoulder....turn left. \n\n\"Why?\" our driver says.\n\n\"Cause that guy walking towards us from the left is nude, man. This has gotta be the place\"\n\nA quick left, the pedestrian walkway between the lots is visible and then BAM! There it is in it's rust colored glory:\n\n\"THE SARATOGA PERFORMING ARTS CENTER\"\n\nLet the games begin. Needless to say the next 48 hours were a watershed event. It was our Woodstock. It was truly the beginning of an trek we're still taking today. \n\nJune 17 and 18, 1983, for us, has never been about the music -  as beautiful as it was. It was about the journey. A youthful expression of life, love, friendship and happiness. Pure laughter and joy encapsulated around a magical circus called The Grateful Dead we were lucky enough to find. \n\nTruly the best of times.",

      "review_text": "A Monster Night Of course, like the others attended this show, I can agree that it was a monster show.  There were several reasons why.  \n\nLet\u2019s start with the atmosphere of SPAC and the surrounding state park.  It was just a beautiful day, and there were so many interesting things going on in the parking lot and the surrounding woods.  I remember a huge drumming circle comprised of eighty people or so in a wooded area, complete with several jugglers \u2013 one juggler having a torch baton.  It really was a circus.  I also remember a \u2018Space Trap\u2019 that I stumbled across in the parking lot \u2013 these people had four boom boxes blaring in a semi circle, with four different dead tapes on, and each tape had a different version of Space playing \u2013 this trap stopped me dead in my tracks.  The people who set it up would just sit there and laugh their asses off at folks like me who wandered into it, which of course had the desired effect of making me laugh my ass off as well.  Another recollection (and of course, like many others, it was tainted by a hit of something that I came across in the parking lot, so perhaps this post needs to be taken with a grain of salt or three), was that there was water shooting out of every rock you could see\u2026.there were natural springs that had these wonderful fountains of water just bubbling away.  I had one of those \u2018lost all my friends\u2019 moments and I wound up down by the river, watching many faces form in the ripples of the water.  This was an incredibly special moment for me, and it set the mood for the rest of the evening (in fact, the calm that I experienced at that moment has been with me since, and has served me well during more stressful periods in my life).  Of course, like everyone else, I found my friends again, and we all headed into the show.  \n\nNext, let me bore you a bit with the technical aspects of the sound system that the DEAD rigged up at SPAC (feel free to correct my shoddy recollection, too).  In the case of SPAC, you had the stage area and the roofed audience area (if I recall, the balcony sat on top of a portion of the seated area that was under roof).  On either side of the stage, the Dead had their fat assed stacks of Meyer Sound Lab speakers.   Phil was about six months into playing his six string bass, and the Dead were using these big huge subwoofer boxes on each side of the stage, in addition to the standard speaker boxes that were sitting on either side of the stage, and also in addition to the wedges that were flown overhead those boxes, stage left and right.  This made for a huge low end sound for Phil to drop his bombs, and they were plentiful that night.  But wait \u2013 that\u2019s not all \u2013 they threw a whole lot more in than a set of Ginzu Knives.  Just outside of the roofed seating area, you had the lawn area.  I happened to be in the lawn area.  The Dead flew additional arrays on each of the support columns that housed the balcony, if I recall correctly.  These arrays had about four or six wedges each, and right below each of these arrays were a stack of Amps (can\u2019t recall the manufacturer \u2013 after all, this was 25 years ago, and I was just coming off a dose at that point).  They also had a security dude by our column that kept his eye on the amps so they didn\u2019t get trashed.  This layout gave Healy the ability to do these amazing stereo sweeps of Jerry\u2019s guitar \u2013 he could have Jerry\u2019s leads fly from one end of the lawn area to the other, an incredibly long distance, with this amazingly large and loud clarity.  This really was an impressive sound, and it blended just beautifully with the natural environment, especially during songs like The Wheel, and of course, Morning Dew, which was a monster Dew, mainly from Phil\u2019s six string bombs. The dead really did it up nice that night.  \n\nLast, let\u2019s talk about the performance and the vibe.  The happiness vibe was infectious that night, and the Dead and the audience really got off on each other.  For this reason, a lot of musical chances were taken that may not have been taken otherwise.  From a playing point of view, the crowd provided a safe environment for the Dead to really explore \u2013 hence the strange drum timing in between Scarlet and Fire.  Sure mistakes were made, but the level of excitement more than made up for them.  It\u2019s all here, even if the audience recording doesn\u2019t perfectly capture the magnitude of the sound system, hence my 4 stars.  I suggest that you download this immediately. \n\nI would like to thank the wonderful folks who taped this show as well as the wonderful folks at Archive for doing such a wonderful service by allowing me to relive that night.",

The mood was ripe for a great show, but nobody expected what awaited us.\n\nThis show was about my 12th. I was definitely a fan by this point, but between the crowd, the chemistry, the weather, and the music, I walked out of that show with a potent addiction for more. \n\nI since saw well over 150 more Dead concerts, but this was easily the best of them. I still feel sorry for the people inside the amphitheater, who didn't get to see the incredible lightning storm that cracked through the show, at times lighting up the evening sky as brightly as the afternoon sun. The lightning was especially intense during (no surprise) Fire on the Mountain, and it certainly seemed to be well synchronized with the music.

The town was just on the edge of not being able to accommodate it all and the next year when the show was announced, the Mayor of Saratoga was on the news saying that the \"problem\" the year before was it was on a weekend so it was crowded and this year it was on a tuesday or something so the crowds would not be as big......well, 40,231 shuffled in.  A record that stands to this day.\n\nThe 83 show was off the hook.  I'm as big a sound quality snob as the next guy but this show gets a pass.  There are just no good recordings that came out of that tin can.  BUT...The Scarlet jam is the scarlet jam you have always wished for without realizing it.  The Dew is as big as it is billed to be.  The band and crowd energy that night was as powerful as any of the 200 shows I went to.  It was one of those nights that is now frozen in time.

We had a convoy of 4 cars and 2 vans all the way up to Saratoga and by the time we got there early in the afternoon the place was packed, There were many alien life forms walking around despensing their mind bending elixirs. Everyone of us drank their Kool-Aid that day and it was just a beautiful summer day with many happy, smiling people all around the place. \n\nI remember looking at the SPAC and the ramps leading into its balcony and thinking it was a big spaceship. Kind of like a Noah's Ark thing going on the whole time,2 of every possible freak you could think of walking up and down around the Mother Ship. We were all tripping our balls off by this time and we decided to stay on the lawn on the jerry side, right in front of the massive stack of speakers they had hanging from the balcony outer column. WE had fun watching all the freaks walking about. The whole place was happy and you sensed something good was going to happen.\n\nThe band came on stage and started playing Bertha and all the people on the lawn started dancing, swirling around us and leaping about. It was so beautiful to see. Words can't do it justice. Boy did we love watching all girls in sun dresses whirling around. Many have said it and I agree with them on how special the vibe was.Jack Straw came next and it set the tone for the rest of the set with the Jerry song and then aBobby song thing that they used to do alot back then.A great Bird Song and Althea followed. Jerry's guitar sounded so good and it seemed to be flowing from everywhere. Healy and the sound crew did a nice job that day. They even had stacks of speakers towards the back of the lawn and I remeber all the heads dancing around them like care free children. The set ended with Deal andthe whole place was singing along with Jerry \"Don't You Let That DEAL!!! Go Down\"\n\nSacrlet Begonias opened the 2nd set and the clouds were rolling in above us. Then after messing around a bit with some cool drums they launced into and epic Fire. Yes, there was lightning coming down above the SPAC during the set and you thought somehow the boys were commanding it.Phil's Bass felt like it was moving air to blow the clouds around. Playing came next and we felt the misty rain coming down but it felt good to us because it was a warm summer night. Drums and Space made its way into The Wheel and right on cue the lightning came down when they sang the verse with lightning in it \"If The Thunder Don't Get Ya Then The LIGHTNING Will!!!\" Many below have mentioned this and yes it sounds cheesy but you had to be there folks. It was like Jerry was in Disney's Fantasia.Garcia the sorcerer playing with the elements in the sky above us. Next came one of the best Morning Dew's I ever heard IMO and I vividly remember some older hippie chick with long blonde hair that was siting on a lawn chair screaming \"C'mon People That's Jerry Garcia Down There. Let Him Know Your Here!!!\" right before it. The whole place went nuts and Jerry must of felt it beacuse this DEW had so much feeling in it. Jerry sang it with so much passion. It still gives me the chills till this day when I listen to it and his guitar playing towards the end is so angelic. \n\nThe way it eneded it was expected being it was Saturday but the Don't Ease before it was strange at the time. Yet it didn't matter beacause everything before it was magical. I ended going to all the SPAC shows and this show still ranks as the best one they palyed there. It's a shame that there is no SBD of this show in circualtion. THis recording does capture the energy very well and I do think its the better source. I give this recording 4 stars and the performance 5 stars but all in all this show is definetly 5 stars in my book because of its energy and it's epicness. Download it and enjoy!",

      "review_text": "Happy 37th SPAC! Never made it to a show at SPAC but Saratoga Springs rocks in the summer - such a beautiful place!  Your stories below paint the picture of the majestic pageant that must have been, when the band (and all of you) came HIGH stepping into town.  Early summer, schools are all out, the days still getting longer, the entire summer lay ahead!  Oh boy those were the days...\nLove love love this show!  Some really hot playing and HIGH energy all around - you can hear and feel the frenzy at certain points.  Bob\u2019s  jam into drums is pretty cool - the spaceship is soaring. I agree with the poster below - after the magnificent Dew the wheels come off a bit - Jerry has blown his gasket.  But that\u2019s OK, he gave you EVERYTHING you ever wanted or needed at that point, the rest is gravy.  ",

      "review_text": "Hammers of the gods Many great reviews of such a  wonderful and pivotal night for so many of us, who were in attendance that summer night 39 years ago.\n\nThere are moments in this show in which Mr. Phil Lesh simply unleased with Thor's hammer.\n\nThe first part of Morning Dew, before the  bridge, is the pinnacle moment of this show.\n\nOften not mentioned is the nearly 20 minute PITB which is  really stretched out and was quite  good. The drums space is ok and nothing like what  happened in the spring or fall this year.\n\nThere are some  very loosey goosey moments the entire show, particularly with Bobby's  guitar going out of tune. I think it was from him playing it so damn hard this night.\n\nThe band was so much tighter come September but this show was the first night of summer tour, so it was a very auspicious and joyous start.\n\nHappy trails.\n\n\n\n  ",
