After an out of tune fade into NFA, the band runs through the end of the song without any fire. Lovelight starts out sloppy, everybody's trying, but it aint' happenin'. There is a strange little jam at about 18 min. that reminds me of zeppelin, on something good. Bobby goes nuts at the end, which I enjoy much, but all in all, they can't get it together. The final minute or so seems like one last shot at it, but again falls short. 3 stars for effort and because I love '70 dead.",
