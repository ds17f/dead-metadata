Yes, Dark Star is embryonic and has the infamous repetitive organ riff, and China Cat has a weak (Phil?) vocal, but all of this adds to the charm of the show-six guys just beginning to discover the possibilities of electric music and excited as hell, as That's It For The Other One ably demonstrates here.",

Set two is one of the greatest pieces of music ever performed live.\n\nThe cut in alligator really bites. It has the bit that sounds like the mountain jam, and is totally necessary to comprehend the whole jam, and should not be missing! But, an enterprising taper with editing software can easily splice in the missing portion from the \"Anthem\" album.  I had a copy of this set a few years back from a real audio source (sounds like crap)that DID NOT have the cut, and I once used that to cover the cut, but the entire missing portion (around a minute) is complete on the album.

I agree with the other reviewer that said the cut in \"Alligator\" should be patched from the Anthem of the Sun album. It's a stupid tape flip that should not be in there, especially for this SBD. That said, it is quite fitting that this show occured on Valentine's Day. It's sweet stuff.",

The rythms Mickey and Bill brought really started to hit the groove here and the jamming is fierce.  I love the sound of Garcia's guitar and Phil's bass, heck overall the sound quality is better then some '85 shows on this site and just think those taping were probablly under the influence of Bear's better stuff.\n\nMusically the Anthem stuff really stands out here and the Spanish Jam is a great vehicle that should havebeen included in that album.

However, I'm rather surprized that no one has commented on the facts that a) the FM broadcast, is slightly louder, I suggest a 10% volume reduction and b) there is a very obvious pitch error. Listen to the two portions of Alligator and it's painful to hear.  This second part is running at the wrong speed, it's slow. As the first part is at the same speed as that on Anthem of the Sun the error must be with the second part.  I used my Goldwave sound editing s/ware to correct this, and subsequent tracks.  I suggest a scale value of 1.020 if you use this or similar s/ware.",

The quality of this recording far surpasses what circulated in the old cassette trading days of the 70's-'90s. There's still some tape source flaws but chock those up to the era of Ampex tape and tripping soundboardists. This is as good as it gets for a '60s era recording. The band is on fire from the get go. They are fucking-on-fire!  The Alligator->Caution will raise the hair on the back of your neck. I used to think that the November '67 Shrine shows were the best of the vintage era but this night puts those shows to shame.\nThe Country Joe & The Fish set from the same night circulates but in almost unlistenable quality.

I swore I wasn't going to do this anymore.I leave my opinion once in a while with the idea that it may help guide someone a little in the choice they make.However once in a while I see my own review and  the follow up is inevitably someone using this forum as a message board to tell me what an ass I am.I call them like I hear them and I make no apollogies for giving an honest review.So like it or not here it is.\n I leave this one only to repeat the sentiment of everyone else here.This show is amazing!This is one of those desert island shows,in my top 5 of all time.\n Don't get me wrong there are plenty of out of key vocals and out of tune guitars so if your looking for perfection you won't find it here.What you will find however is one of the most spirited performances of the Deads career.From start to finish they are smokin'.\n  Jerry's solos are short(for the Dead anyway),concise, brilliant instant mini compositions within the larger framework.These represent the highest watermark for improv in the rock genre.Rare it is to find a musician of Jerrys caliber working in a rock band forging new paths that have yet to be taken.This kind of territory is considered exclusive to jazz and free improv artist by most.Jerry proves that idea to be just plain false.\n The other note worthy perfomances are the first signs of Bob turning into a rhythm guitar monster and his vocals are really strong for this era.\n  Pigpen.I like Pigpen.When Pig was on it was magic, when he wasn't,well lets just say even when it was bad it was still better than the hot burning knitting needle in the ear sometimes refered to as Brent Mydland.But thats another review.Pig at his best transcended his limits as a musician and did his magic like no one else.This show is one of those magic nights.This is my favorite Alligator of all time.It's so loose and out of controll.Good Morning Little.. is pretty damn good also.\n Last but certainly not least the sound quality on this one is great.A 2 track from 1968 with better dynamics and mix qualitys than most modern day commercially produced material.We cleaned this show up  a little bit and mastered it here at the Grail and WOW!What dynamics,man the bass on this one will shake your teeth loose w/ a little eq and a sub.The levels are a little hot sometimes and cause some minor distortion but considering the age of the source this is a pretty small gripe.We are lucky to be the benefactors of such excellent engineering of a classic performance.\n Thank God that someone had the vision to document and store this historic piece of Art.\nEnjoy and see you somewhere else.\n\nCheers,\nJimi Justin \nHoly Grail Studios",

In Phil's book he recounts how the band had just found out about Neal Cassady's death down in Mexico, dead on the railroad tracks from exposure. Typical Neal, dyin on the tracks. Phil said the band was trying to capture Neal's energy through this show, and I think is one reason why this show is so smokin. Neal was obviously a one-of-a-kind that epitomozied the scene of the sixties. \nThanks Neal for the inspiration!",

I totally agree with other reviewers- this is possibly their best show, certainly their best of this era thus far a seeming pinnacle of everything that had preceeded it- the vision had ben realized here..cassady had just died, the scene down the street was out of control and the band members were preparing to move out of 710. They knew this era was coming to an end and they play their hearts out. We are still feeling the waves of this show today. Unbelievable playing, great sound quality.",

It is the most powerful, loud and raucous show with a full and deep set list. Jerry's guitar is SOOO LOUD here and they are out of control with energy like no other show I have ever heard. Not sure what the difference was with the guitar, but it seems different than other shows around this time period. This one stands out at the top of the list from any year period. In appending my review now let me say that '68 was soooo good with all of its variety, but especially early in the year the Dead were just OTHER WORDLY. Spanish Jam and the tunes surrounding it are just surreal on a variety of these early '68 dates. Be assured that these '68 shows are the Dead at their best ever. period.",

I had this tape for a loooong time, one of my faves, and I always wondered why that one song sounded different.  \n\nIt was from 1/14/1967, the \"official\" start of \"The Summer of Love\" (you know, nothing back then was really *official\"...), The Great Human Be-In afternoon gig at Golden Gate Park in SF.  Still really great, and the song they opened with.\n\n&&&\nAnd Jim F on 6/27/2004 mentioned the \"Mountain Jam\" riff.  I'm not exactly sure when the Allmans started doing Mountain Jam, but they were adapting Donovan (Leitch)'s \"First There Is a Mountain\".  So did the Dead.  It took me about 20 years to realize that!!  So Donovan was first, in like 1967, then the Dead, then Allmans.  Who knows who else borrowed this sweet riff.\n\nAbout this show:  One of the best shows ever.  I remember reading one of the Dead books (Playing in the Band?, or one of the other ones) that the band on that Valentine's Day were in a contentious mood, and Jerry was really pissed off at the set they were playing.  Later, in retrospect, he admitted it was one of their best fuckin shows ever.  Serious.  Jerry fessed up.\n\nI did acid out in nature once to this tape.  One of their best.",

      "review_text": "Fantastic Show The reviewer who said that the Morning Dew came from Human Be-In is incorrect. I have that show and when you listen to the Be-In, you can tell that they are playing outside. The Dew from this show definitely sounds like it's in a small building with a respectful audience. Also, if you guys are familiar with the dead's sixties stage lineup, you'll know that Jerry comes out of your right headphone and Bobby comes out the left with Phil in betwen them. On this show, the change sides. Morning Dew is the only song on here which has Jerry on his usual side and it sounds like it comes from late in 1967. Just a guess. I sometimes wonder if this show is from the Carousel Ballroom. I mean, I know Phil says it does but I have a few other shows from the Carousel and they all sound really tight like the band is playing in a small room. This show sounds like a much bigger venue. Good Morning Little Schoolgirl opens with the crowd talking amongst themselves, very loose. Jerry has a down and dirtiness about his soloing on this tune and Bobby's guitar seems to have a slide feel about it. Dark Star has a few seconds from the beginning cut off and it does have the infamous Pig Pen organ riff but I actually like it. It doesn't get too irritating like the 8-23-68 show, where Pig is otherwise fantastic. China Cat Sunflower cuts off a little too early but the transition into The Eleven is like a playground of sound. At this point in time, Turn On Your Lovelight has been in the band's repetoire for six months and 9 days. It debuted at Toronto's O'Keefe Center on August 5, 1967 playing next to Alligator. It doesn't have the famous raveups that Pig would give it around 1969 and 1970 until he left the band. But it does have a great jazzy feel about it. It feels as if we've gone from blues, to playground of sound, to Birdland. This is the end of the first set and it cuts off just before Jerry finishes the announcement of the upcoming band Country Joe & The Fish. They have a setlist on here but from what I hear it's not very good sound. Neither is their setlist from the May 19, 1968 show at the Northern California Folk Rock Festival. \nThe second set has them opening with Cryptical Envelopement, The Other One and Cryptical Envelopement dedicating their set to the memory of San Francisco beatnik legend Neil Cassidy who was the hero of Jack Kerouac's On The Road. New Potato Caboose is played with such fervor that I've never heard by Jerry. This is Garcia's best performance on the song. For Phil listen to the one from Two From The Vault. Bobby shines on Grateful Dead Download Series, Vol. 6. Pig shines on Dick's Picks, Vol. 22. For Billy and Mickey listen to the 1/22/68 show from Eagle's Auditorium. Born Cross-Eyed has a long space feedback jam lasting about four minutes before going deeper and deeper into Spanish Jam. This is most \"Spanish\" jam I have ever heard. We then close with one of the greatest sequences of Alligator, Caution and Feedback ever performed. Alligator starts off with the band tuning and making jokes. My favorite: Bobby saying \"In 1941 the Japanese invaded the Solomon Islands.\" The song starts up and after the versus we are taken into a trance with an early rhythm devil solo. We then take off into nowhere with a magical, everlasting jam which slows down into a hypnotic Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) which only furthers itself into a monster of a Feedback. The band performs In The Midnight Hour as an encore. All in all, a fantastic show that you might regret you didn't download sooner before they took everything down.",

This show is the best of a great run of February shows, 2/2, 2/03, 2/14, and 2/23-2/23 Kings Beach Lake Tahoe (aka, Dick\u2019s Picks Vol. 22) are all outstanding shows in an outstand run of Anthem shows. This is better show than Dick\u2019s Picks 22. Also excellent audio and mixing.\n\nThe second set is the Anthem of the Sun live: the complete album with the order of the songs as on the album. In fact, much of this show was used on Anthem of the Sun. Plus, a Spanish Jam thrown in for good measure. \n\nIf it were just the second set, this would be a great show. But the first set is also great. It starts with typically Morning Dew of the period, with Pigpen\u2019s keyboard supplying the groundwork for the Jerry-Phil-Bob jam. Dark Star, still less than two months old at this point, and still a short, but it\u2019s tight. DS goes into China Cat (they hadn\u2019t written St. Stephan yet for between Dark Star and the Eleven. This is pretty rare, as the played China Cat in this sequence only for a few months before dropping it for St. Stephen. I love the sound of this China Cat, fast and raw and together, with Jerry really in the zone. It then takes off into the Eleven. Driving with energy, Pigpen\u2019s organ pushes the Eleven along. It\u2019s also clean and tight with great vocals. The Eleven resolves neatly into Turn on Your Lovelight, continuing the force of the set. This is only the second time they played Lovelight, but it\u2019s a dandy.\n\nJerry dedicates the second set to the memory of Neal Cassady (\u201cCowboy Neal\u201d), who had died the previous week. A fitting dedication. Then comes a nearly perfect Anthem of the Sun set, and it\u2019s easy to see why they used it on the album. Cryptical>Other One is pure dynamite, and crips and clean and tight, the way performances of Passenger from 1977 are tight\u2014everything is in the right place.\n\nOne thing great about this show is that the transitions are smooth and flawless, including the one into New Potato. This features some artful improvising by Phil after the vocals. Jerry lets Phil go at it alone and then comes in with some rhythm guitar licks, slowly building in intensity. It\u2019s masterful. The rarely performed Born Cross-Eyed is a natural capper, but the action doesn\u2019t end here. After all this energy, the Dead go into a spacy, long Spanish Jam that ebbs and flows, and evolves in mood. \n\nPigpen\u2019s vocal isn\u2019t loud enough in Alligator, but the Alligator jam is fabulous. Following Jerry in this jam is like following Coltrane. Things then speed up for Caution, and the Dead go off into another zone altogether. Caution and feedback are inspired, building to controlled chaos before receding into nothingness.\n\nThere are a few different versions of this show here at archive. This best has a patch of the cut in the Alligator jam, found here:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-02-14.sbd.miller.89676.sbeok.flac16",

Anybody interested in ordering can contact me at will.ruddock@gmail.com.\n\nBy the way this includes the entire 4 night Fillmore West run that sold out in 2005 so this is your chance to hear it again.\n\nThis show is a classic. I've already reviewed it.",

Please do yourself a favor and check out the tight/raging cryptical, the other worldly other one and my personal favorite eleven. FIVE STARS for a high energy early, clearly out of control show.",

Neal's impact on the group was both sublime and profound. His loss no doubt fuelled their playing on this epic night of music.",

The spoken word is quite an understated dedication considering the impact cassidy had on these fellows.  The quality of the music they played in his dedication is not understated at all.  As always, they allowed he music to do the talking",

      "review_text": "Great recording It is amazing how good this recording sounds. It's better than 90% of the shows I've heard post 60's. This is Owsley's doing right? Really cool that they had such crisp recording from this era. it sounds almost like a studio, in fact better than most of the dead's albums!\n\nFirst show after Cassady's death, as mentioned below. Typical 60's setlist which can get boring if they are not jamming hard. Short Dark Star(this is only like maybe the tenth time they played it?), really good School Girl, middle of the road China Cat, love the guitar interplay of Jerry/Bob on The Eleven but not the most intense version of this song.\n\nThey are playing and singing really well tonight, Lovelight is on the shorter end but still kicks ass and I think I prefer it this way. \n\nSecond set has Neal Cassady vibes all over it, very cool! A really meaningful Other One, never my favorite song but you have to love it here. \n\nI have to give it a 4 because they do not go really far out on this night but they are playing and sounding so well it's a good show to introduce people to the 60's acid dead and a good eulogy for Neal Cassady/Dean Moriarty/Cody Pomera.\n\n\"Cowboy Neal at the wheel on the bus to never ever land\"\n\nAnd after really thinking about the historic significance of this I am going to give it a 5.",
