I haven't given the rest of the show good enough a listen... though all the songs available seem very hot (I can\u00c2t tell if this is a complete show or not\u00c2 Greatest Story appears cut-off).  What is clear, is that I have never heard a better Hard to Handle (I\u00c2d love to get the date of a better version if you think I\u00c2m wrong).  This version is virtually perfect\u00c2much like the Barton Hall 5/8/77 Scarlet-Fire or Morning Dew.  Qarkus is absolutely right\u00c2why has no one else commented on this until now?  I\u00c2ve heard this material years ago, I believe, on David Gans\u00c2 show.  I lost/misplaced the tape I made of it, and it is quite a pleasure to hear it again and confirm my belief concerning the show.  I was searching for this particular Hard to Handle on the Archive for some time and luckily read Qarkus\u00c2 review today...  Everything about it is great.  Pigpen is right on target with the band backing him up and his rapping perfectly.  Also, it appears that the entire band is on.  Garcia, Lesh and Weir are all inspired.  Weir!! It appears to me-- and it could be that my ear is not trained well enough--  that the first two (great) solos are performed by Bob Weir and that Garcia plays the rest.  Weir\u00c2s solos are wonderful in that they are interesting, flow perfectly with the song, and appear to inspire Jerry.  The mix is great with Weir's rhythm guitar perfectly balanced with the rest of the band.  Phil and Jerry\u00c2(!)  I can\u00c2t say enough about it.",

I recomend this show for download for everybody. This show is good for the first time listener and the completist. Thank you to the archive staff and the uploader.

      "review_text": "Phil Missed This One O.K. kids, let's get this straight. This really is the best Hard To Handle EVER! The version on The Phil Zone, as well as ALL others, pales by comparison. The combination of Phil climbing the fretboard and Jerry's bending of strings to climax Jerry's solo simply cannot be clearly spoken about. It just has to be listened to. The music here does all the talking. The intensity of Phils chording and Jerry's 1971 guitar tone is... er... intense. Bobby lays down a nice solo to begin the break from Pig's vocals. One of his best. Pig's vocals are RIGHT ON and a pleasure to listen to. One literally breathes a sigh of relief once they go back into the vocals. That's how intense Jerry and Phil made the solo in this version... everything exactly perfect. Much like any extreme pleasure, one can only handle so much until exhaustion sets in. The Truckin>Drums>Other One is also a pleasure. The other songs are all standout versions. If you're a Dead Head you Simply gotta own this CD. There is a little bit of everything here that makes us love The Dead so much. Need I say more?",

Previous reviews seem to give their kudos the HTH, and after hearing you'll know why.    GSET starts out with a little echo that makes it seem as if you're right their in hall listening to the show it happened---GREAT SHIT MAN!!!    NTYSM has Pigpen (without his organ...HA!!!) playing harp, and the \"tone\" of the show is still being maintained---WHOA!    Jerry's opening to Loser has always been a fav of mine & he/they don't let up from their stride a bit.    And then...yet another fine example of Truckin'---what more is there to say other than that?    After the 2nd verse it transitions nicely into drums & then EXPLODES into TOO.     Unfortunately, it cuts after they finish the last verse, so the momentum stops...\"dead\".\n\nIt's a shame the soundboard of the entire show isn't available, because this one sounds pretty damn spectacular.",

      "review_text": "best hard to handle? I don't agree that this is the best hard to handle. It is pretty good and I do recognize that the tune only got better with age, while much attention is focused on early 1970 and bear's choice from the fillmore east, 1971 was where the dead mastered the tune, and it probably influenced bobby in the writing of one more saturday night and I need a Miracle IMO.  \n\nI feel the apex of the song was when they added the end jam, B-A-D-F sharp, I feel it allows for closure of the jam, not just \"well lets finish it off\", but instead offers a point to aim for.  You can hear this in April thru August.  People maintain that 8-6-71 is the  best, so it's refreshing to hear another opinion.  I suspect 8-26-71 (the very last version) is the best, as it just has it all.  Keith would have sounded great on this tune, as he did on good lovin and the rare love lights, too bad it didn't come up in europe. \n\non the 1982 new years show which you can see part on youtube, with etta james, she plays with the group the song, and pays tribute to otis redding, and does a very generic version. I cant help wonder if she new they ever played it a decade ago with Pig, and that they absolutely licked it?",

      "review_text": "It rocked!! I went to 34 dead concerts, many at Winterland when I was in highschool, 1970-71 period. They were all way fun, but this one stands out. The Sufi choir and dancers were kind of cool; they came out first, it was dark with drums and some kind of fire on stage. They had some middle eastern music, and as it was kind of winding down, there was that familiar guitar sneaking in from behind - Jerry kind of hiding in the back. The audience perked up... Seems like the New Riders came out next,but I could be mistaken. Anyway, this was really the best era for the Dead in my opinion; the band was tight, they had a lot of new material, the venues were not that large, but most of all they had Pigpen and at this time he was in good shape and in fine form. I was in seats in the very back of the ground floor when Hard to Handle came on. It was not on any records at that time but we had heard it at a couple of previous concerts and were hoping they would play it. Well, they played it alright. To this day it was my most memorable GD experience. It was just such an awesome jam, and loud! I kept thinking it would eventually show up on a Dick's Picks CD, but not so far. I've thought of trying to contact someone with access to the vaults that could dig this up. So glad to find it here. What a great thing for it now to be accessible to the world. Glad to hear you other GD fans and reviewer's like it so much. Definately a gem. I picked up the Deadheads Taping Compendium the other day and looked this concert up and this is what Brian Dyke says, \"The play is average, the emotional factors absent, and the summation is a very rehearsed and unimprovised performance.\" Huh?!",

Looking at the reviews under 4/28 I see I'm not alone.\n\nThe diversity of Head's opinions is one of the things that makes being a fan of this band so much fun.

Though the playing in this section is inspired, it does seem to cause some confusion, as the band sort of stumbles back into the verses. \n\nOnly a minor complaint, as this is still one of the most compelling and unique Hard to Handles ever played, besides the fabled versions from the Fillmore East in April.",
