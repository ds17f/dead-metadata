      "review_text": "Stronger than dirt! All too often this show gets lost in the light of the GAMH and Winterland shows from this year. However, this one is another true gem.\n  The sound is excellent, everyone heard clear and bright, with a nice open sounding mix to boot. Only Phil suffers very slightly, but not bad at all.\n  The show opens with a great 'Help On The Way-> Slipknot!' back then these where new. Not as dreamy as these would become, but sharp and strong. Next up is another new one of 'Music Never Stopped' which is also very excellent and lots of soul. The rest of part one is good and happy. All and all, a good warm up for part 2 of the concert.\n  Moving there, part two, beginning with a very strong 'Truckin'' 'The Eleven Jam-> Drums -> Stronger Than Dirt' has some of the raw, grit and wicked Jerry playing you'll ever hear, almost like he reached back into the '68 school again. It will surely steal your face right off your head! Mind boggling ideas that will make you'll jaw drop the first listen (if not repeated ones) Amazing playing for sure! The 'Not Fade Away -> Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad -> One More Saturday Night' is nearly as hot with great interplay between the members. This is one show I will love forever, excellent on all fronts.\n\nOf note, Diga Rhythm Band (Hart's) opened the show, and photos show Jerry playing with them. I sure would love to hear a recording of it, yet years of searching has turned up nothing. Does anyone know if it even exists (it has to be somewhere!) then please let me know. -amellowsoulAThappyhippieDOTcom",

I had just started my senior year of high school in Sacramento. We heard The Dead were going to play for free in the park so we drove the 2 hours and worked our way up to the front just as they opened. This being my fourth show, and first since 10-20-74, I was ecstatic. The reason they didn't go into Franklin's out of Slipknot is Jerry broke a string. It was just so great to see them again.

I had listened to the other copy of this and did not enjoy it as much and heard winterland today which does not have the funk of this - listen to the lead in on not fade it is so funky and rockin and reminds me of the lead in on 4/12/83 let it grow which is arguably the best later version. the truckin and jam afterwards is ripping and agree there is more that a whiff of the eleven in there - pity they did not come through, drums are great and you notice the difference with mickey in there who was noticeably absent during gd movie and all of those winterland shows. sound quality and remastering is superb and manythanks to whomever it was that donated this - i have gotten way pickier with 5's but this deserves it.\n\nThe harmonica I think is John Cippolina though not 100 pct on that he is on 12/31/81 aiko and some others...",

The most notable is Phil and Bobby calling for a Doctor in the house and also the husband because \"Your wife's having a baby\"  i am pretty sure this occurs between music never stopped and TLEO but would have to listen to the set again to be certain.  I took the download and inserted the missing banter into it's rightful places btwn songs before burning my disc.  All it took was uploading the tape and converting it to digital. this Baby banter is excellent because it embodies the microcosmic world that is a Dead show..real life happens here!  I found the download lacking for it's omission. the sound quality of this download however is vastly superior to my 30 yr old tape.",

This show sounds alot like the other so called \"rematered\" show postings.The floor noise has been raised and there is a great deal of signal loss in the mids(audio analyzer fact not my opinion),and something has happened to the excellent stereo imaging in the other version.The two drum kits sound tremendously better in the other posting.If you have any intention of tweaking the audio yourself avoid this version and get the earlier posting.However if your listening through your computer speakers or a soso stereo the added high end on this might be to your liking.There is already a posting less degenerated and closer to the source recording, I would seriously recomend it over this version.",

A great clean balanced mix, with more ambience and natural reverb than typical for '75 shows (perhaps the outdoor venue contributed to this). Some delicate singing by Garcia. Bright metallic Travis Bean plucking. Phil very melodic with that nice syncopated counterpoint style from the Allah era. In some of the jams you can really hear Bobby getting into the more elaborate chord voicings  which marked a change from the his early 70\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s playing around this time.\n\nRe: the posts below concerning converting streaming to audio files. Lets face it folks...Bobby and others in the organization are no fools. They know people can use various techniques (including conversion software) to enable capturing of all of these streams. But most will not go to this trouble, and the quality (short of software editing of a resulting audio file) will be nowhere close to a nicely recorded shn or flac file - much less an official release.\n\nIt's a compromise. Let's continue to support the boys and their families by buying shit. Then the spirit of the collective musical unconscious can continue on sites like this \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 regardless of what some may do with the resultant streams.

Famished for the sound of good music. And to\n\nPartake of the PHAT of the land.\n\nMagnificent, one-of-a-kind performances with minor flubs. Totally rapture-forming! Cloud to ground. Stalagmite to Stalagtite.\n\nThe superb quality of play is slightly robbed by less than stellar recording enhanced nicely by ashley's manueverings du bass.\n\nthis is a magnificent performance and adequate recording/remastering.\n\nIt merits all five stars by virtue of superb play.\n\nThis is a great Grateful Dead show. You may liken it to an exquisitely long and extended second set.\n\nOutrageous, best-ever GDTRFB. Totally mind-fryind.\n\nThere is no One More Saturday Night on this stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven NFA is good.",

      "review_text": "Favorite show of all time About 16 yrs ago, someone handed me this tape. I did not pay any mind to the venue or date, just plug & play. It was a scratchy Audience tape, but who am I kidding.. I dig them. I put my headphones on and pretended I was there. When I heard the boys announce, \u201cYour wife is having a baby\u201d, I sat straight up as if propelled by force, eject and looked at the date...9- 28-1975, plain as day\u2026My oldest brother died that day\u2026and here is some kid coming out to play for the first time. It was the most beautiful thing to me, I broke into tears so hard that I actually drew attention from my roomies in the next room. It was the most intense experience that I have ever had with a dead tape. I wish I could meet that kid, shake their hand, give \u2018em a hug.  If your reading, just know that I love you already.",

Over the next 20 years, saw them at Kezar for SNACK Sunday, Winterland, lots of Kaiser shows in December, Red Rocks, Spartan Stadium for the first concert without Keith and Donna)drove up from college in San Diego). Of course, at the closing of Winterland and got tix thru Mayor Moscone's office before the tragedy.",

      "review_text": "Quite possibly the first tape I ever heard...(I_!) 10th grader in a small resort town in northern Minnesota, I fell in with some nice hippies who lived on a commune off the grid out by Wolf Lake.  I would not hear the band live for 2 more years, until May 77, my senior year, in Saint Paul, 250 miles south of there.  Ahhh the fine, fun memories of those folk and their very fine commune, complete with sauna in a cabin over a crystal clear stream, homemade goat yogurt, and a kick ass sound system with all the Dead needed to fill a young gurl's heart.",

      "review_text": "Fantastic energy You can tell the band was really in a good mood this night. Their playing is full of zest and energy, like they were really enjoying it. Honestly this is a feeling I get from quite a few shows from the hiatus years. The extra rest they got from taking a break from touring seems to have really helped them focus. \n\nIf you're a big Keith fan like me, you'll love this show. His licks in Franklin's, Big River, and Goin' Down the Road are stylish and tight, and sound just funky as hell on the slightly overdriven Rhodes. I always loved when he played the Rhodes, and he's on it for this whole show. \n\nThe vocals and drums are a little back in the mix, but honestly I'm fine with that. Phil and Jerry are both extremely clear in this recoding. You can hear finger noise on the strings clearly. ",
