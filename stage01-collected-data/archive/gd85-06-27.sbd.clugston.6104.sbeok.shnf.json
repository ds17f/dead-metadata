Drove up from Long Island in the back of a 1976 Gold Duster with three other dudes and sold a batch of early tee's made with the famous Aljo dyes from NYC. This paid for my show and my weed. I remember that we contructed a make-shift tent using Hefty bags and using the open trunk of the Duster as a frame. We were stoned to the B-Jesus and it took us two hours to build it. We were proud. Then the Jack-booted NY State Trooper showed up and destroyed our tent with his billy-club, he also took my 22\" US Bong equipped with a six-bowl Slider, all fully packed with green, stinky, deslicious weed. That bastard ruined our tent but did not ruin the show. I remember bits and pieces and all of it ethereal, surreal and other-worldy, as SPAC shows always were. I slept that night in the trunk of the Duster curled around the spare.",

I was there, though not totally in my body, and was blown away from beginning to end.  SPAC was an awesome place to see the Dead.

I'll second what the previous reviewer said about the rapid-fire song to song nature of this show. Though I was in a state of mind to be readily manipulated by the band, the progression and pace of songs was like a riptide to be certain, and after being pulled out into their crashing waves Baby Blue was the most soothing and calming landing. This was a great show and great tour really. Didn't it pour rain too? Thanks for the recording.",

      "review_text": "Could have been a Vault Release I certainly am not arguing that 11/1/85 is not a show worthy of Dick's Picks. But this show could be and hopefully one day will be released.\n\nI know - there is a big draw back from that!!\n\nBut this is one of the top 5 shows (imho) of '84, '85 and '86.\n\nIt has most everything - Midnite Hour opening, Crazy Fingers, wild happenings on the Balcony, Supplication Jam. And that's just the first set.\n\nStranger is cooking!!! Brent matches rock star Weir \"crazy Night!!!\" The segue into \"Eyes\" is not perfect, but what a song choice for Jerry!\nPostSpace is awesome...and this may be the best post-Pigpen Lovelight (helped by Healy's echo and reverb) that Weir ever did. (I know that is still a cry from Ron RIP).\n\nAnyway...JBG is also sizzling and I think along with She Belongs to Me, Jerry REALLY connected with Dylan's \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.\"\n\nEnjoy God Bless.",

I would be lying if I said I can remember any of these songs, but I do recall the incredible scene on the lawn, at the campsite that night, and all over town the next day. Listening to this now is a real gift to me, as I was never able to see the band in its entirety again (although I will be seeing Dark Star Orchestra in Malibu this weekend!)",

Watching hundreds of gate crashers run through the dozens of security was interesting.  Most of the night was dry though it did rain lightly toward the end.  I had to ride my motorcycle 30 miles south through drizzle.  The bike was running like shit and I was barely better.\n\nThe atmosphere was awesome.  Most participants seemed primed for the festivities.  Dead music sounds even better outside.  People can move about.  The wind becomes a stage prop.  Sitting in a theater seat watching a show pales in comparison.  I saw them in Utica in 1981 and the Syracuse Dome in 1983.  Had fun at each of those shows but this was my favorite.  The ambiance is just that much better.  That's what I love about the LOCKN Festival held in VA in late August each year.  Great music in a Grateful venue.",

      "review_text": "Hazy Clarity Reading the reviews from like minded heads about this epic show,  I am adding more perceptions from that beautiful day on 6/27/85.This venue was one of the top three summer sheds although four is the number of times they played there. This show was for sure the apex, as my brother was with me, he was also here in 84 and I was here again in 88. Set in Adirondack Park,  the things that stand out are the overall happy vibe,along with the sheer magnitude of humanity.Everybody who was there has a story, and here's mine. Driving up from Long Island early am show day with my two high school head buddies Tom Miale and John Lamonica, we were in good spirits, I drove,  my vehicle was mechanically sound so we enjoyed the ride. I was to meet my brother and a few friends, one who had a box center lower balcony.  Good news my ticket was mailed a few weeks beforehand and my buds were on the lawn. We were in. Arriving, parking was were you turned off the engine, while daylight everything seems so easy, but ten hours later the mountain darkness rendered vehicle location an hours long activity.  Into the venue, over the bridge every one was ready. The sheer amount of gooney bird  was probably the primary reason for all these great memories from so long ago, or was it really that far back. I saved mine for the next night decompressing in front of a bonfire and glad I did, for the added responsibility of driving a few folks to our next destination curtailed my dosing enthusiasm on that night. Anyways with the mammoth 85 20 years so far tour lots of hot shows were abound and the Nassau shows three months earlier verified that. Downstate, you know with all the venues and shows there's a certain vibe, but anything Albany and North amplifies the feeling. This was my first show back after 82, when my thirsty habit took me off the bus. Two things struck me,. Jerry's physical condition and Brent's strength. Constant touring ,these things go unnoticed but overall this evolved into a monster since my last shows in 82.  Upon my entrance to the balcony, I felt like a lucky NYE  ticket holder with glances of envy shot my way.  I had that peculiar feeling that these lawn people wanted in and it was gonna happen.Getting to my seat and meeting some new friends it was like heaven in that amphitheater with the pine trees behind the band. I arrived during Bertha, so I had a good view of the madness that was simmering. From my vantage point during Rooster I believe,  the security arm chain buckled under the human volume and up the ramps they started to ascend. Our little box became like any other show, crowded with heads.the balcony that might have seated 1200 was now taking on at least twice as much. As this was going on,  the band noticed what was transpiring and next is what's heard on the tapes. Being accommodating people, all were welcome but during Don't Ease I was really feeling the structural integrity of the balcony becoming a sort of trampoline. My bud with the box freaked and headed for the exit. Probably the only one, because after the break was the reason we spend all our time, money and life in this persuit.The 2nd set was just awesome and by Eyes that balcony was shedding plaster on to the unfortunate ones below. This could well have been the ultimate tragedy for The Grateful Dead and had the potential of being the a total  disaster at any concert, anywhere. After, the show, a few concerts at SPAC were cancelled, Clapton among them, , while emergency repairs were made on the structure. What we got was the east coast  80's similarity to Veneta., but with 60,000 heads, some scary mob scene action and one of the last summer shows before they started playing football stadium's every summer and it wasn't just \"us\" anymore.\n     \n                        March 18, 2017\n                        Edward J Roller",

Upon hearing it again, after so many years, I really cracked up. Their banter was just as good as I remember it. As for the music, what happened, Jerry didn't feel like finishing \"Feel like a Stranger\"? Took forever to get to Hershey the next day.",

      "review_text": "a wild show that almost became a tragedy Beautiful venue...it was overrun...the staff lost control of the entry points. There was a Harley davidson Convention in Syracuse the night before and a huge biker crowd showed ...we had to pick up and carry a girl in the mayhem of getting in. once in the cowherd you had no control...if someone fell they would have died in the crowd. I am crazy as hell and have done alot of of stupid and insane things but the press of the crowd at the entry points was one of the scariest experiences of my life. If we hadn't put the girl on our shoulders she would have been a casualty of an unruly  mob. Was thinking it was gonna end up like the Who show where people were crushed by the crowd. The band was distracted and played  decent but lots of firworks were being lit...ashcans, m80s etc....watched a beautiful girl with waste length hair get hit by a sideways careening buzz bomb ....burned her hair up....in an altered state it was not what I considered to be a better show....loved the Dead and saw them at least 70 times but this show was memorable for the wild and out of control nature of the vibe",

This was my first High Time and my 59th show. We were in the pavilion. I remember looking back at that dumb shit climbing around the edge of that small balcony that wrapped around SPAC. This was my third and last visit to Saratoga for The Grateful Dead after attending the previous two years. So many great memories. ",

      "review_text": "One for the record books I went to this show on a whim when I was 18. Some friends were leaving out of Boston to drive up for the show and then staying in Albany for the night. I bumped into them and they asked me to come, so I parked my car and jumped into the van.\n\nI remember very little of the trip. We started smoking weed immediately and by the time we got there, I was completely and totally stoned. I didn't have a ticket but that was no problem. I was able to buy one from a scalper along with 4 hits of acid, 2 purple plastic and 2 gooney birds. The guys selling it said some of the purples were not very good, so I dosed them all. At least, I think I did. Nothing is clear beyond the arrival.\n\nAt some point, the acid hit me hard. I vaguely remember being lost in the crowd at one point and not able to find my friends on the lawn. Colors and patterns were overwhelming. Then, out of the blue, I bumped into my cousin. She was there with a friend and they took me under their wing and were able to help me find my friends. They hung out with us for a while and then I lost track of them.\n\nI remember people storming past security and seeing some guys get punched. I also remember when the band stopped the show to yell at someone hanging from the balcony. I know we also ran with a bunch of people and got down toward the stage at one point.\n\nTo be honest, I really don't remember the performances. After the show, we picked up a guy who wanted a ride but who literally couldn't speak. We drove him to Albany with us and he left us at some point. Never saw him again.\n\nI've told this story in varying levels of detail for decades. Recently, I brought it up to my cousin to get some clarification on things that happened that night. She looked at my funny and then said, I've never been to a Dead show. She was positive she wasn't there. If it weren't for the description of this event here, I would not have been sure it happened at all. But everything lines up. I was there. It was crazy on a level I never went to again.\n\nI haven't taken acid in decades and don't intend to again. But man, what a long strange trip it was.",
