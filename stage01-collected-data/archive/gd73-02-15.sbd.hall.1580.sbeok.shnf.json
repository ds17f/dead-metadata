I had mentioned on some other group that I was trying to find the best possible copy of this show to vine to the masses.  I got a private email telling me to send two 60m DATs and I'd be hooked up.  Well when I got the DATs and saw the lineage written on the cases I about flipped ! So I set to mastering these on CD. the mastering was as follows:\n\nPanasonic sv-3700 > Cool Edit Pro via SPDIF > CD Wave > CD/SHN\n\nand I sent a copy of this off to Mike Hall to be vined and the rest is history - that's the story of how this show came to me and then on into public circulation.\n\nWhat a wonderful show and what a treat to be able to sit here and stream the show....\nThanks Dougal !\nenjoy!",

And the 2nd Set opener HC Sunshine may be the best ever- Jerry wails! The  Dark Star is one of the best for 1973- very jazzy and mellow, with a magical transition into Eyes. Phil also is beginning to come into his own now as a soloist, as you'll hear. One of the first monster Phil shows of 1973. An auspicious portend of the year's musical heights that lay ahead. Plus Uncle John's Band for an encore? Get outta here!\nEnjoy this show with your favorite cereal.\nDr. Flashback :-)",

A great but somewhat mellow Dark Star leads into an excellent solo from Phil. Jerry eventually joins them for a short duet, at the end of which, you hear Phil laying down the groove for Eyes Of The World. It sounds like Phil calling the song (whereas it'd usually be Jerry).

All of my favorites feature excellent Eyes, but this one--the second one played--has been one of my favorites for nearly 20 years.  Starts off with a great Phil solo out of Dark Star, and just a sublime, relaxed intro into Eyes--it's picks up steam like an old steam engine.  Complete with the harmonics concurrent with the end of Phil's solo, it will blow you away.\n\nJerry's solos would not get this back to this level until the fall, imho.  The exit jam is equally compelling, and lengthy, and falls perfectly into China Doll.  Add to that a crushing HC Sunshine, a wonderfully long PITB in the first set, and some stellar versions of Bertha, Big River, Jed, Straw, and China>Rider (this was one of the last pre-retirement China>Riders without the little UJB-like riff before Rider), and incredible sound quality...well, why haven't you downloaded it yet??",

Check out the Eyes Of The World, it's completely off the hook. However the recording has some noticable volume fluctuations, two cut songs and often the sound is kinda grainy. Everything is audible but clarity is lost due to what I can only describe as a grimy/gritty element to the sound. It's not clipping, just not clear. But don't let that stop you from streaming this wonderful show, it's absolutely worth hearing and the sound issues aren't that bad. 1973 seems to get short shrift or doesn't get praised enough and I don't know why. Maybe because '72 was so completely innovative and '74 was so stellar in the jam department? Well 1973 was kind of a transitional year but even an average show from '73 is wonderful and this show is above average. I was just beginning to explore the '73 stuff when Archive changed their policy about downloads, this is one of the few shows I got:-(   I wish there was some way to convince the Dead that downloading is a good thing.

I agree the overall mix is fantastic, though the VBR sounds a bit less clean to my ear (A- maybe).  \n\nThe highlights are many, including a great TLEO (they should've kept the bridge and not slowed it down, I feel these early '73 versions are the better arrangement), some of Jerry's best chicken pickin' in Big River, an afore-mentioned killer Bertha, my 2nd favorite Here Comes Sunshine (just edged out by DP#1), a nice China>Rider, and of course the dreamy, jazzy Dark Star>Eyes>China Doll centerpiece.  A word about the Eyes: Yeah, it's not fully developed, and they don't flow through the outro changes as well as in subsequent years, but the spacey, almost meandering quality of this Eyes jam is a PERFECT compliment to both the spartan 'Star before it, and the delicate China Doll after it.  Listen with an open mind, and try not to compare to some of the obviously tighter Eyes.\n\n'73 is my personal favorite year for the boys, you've got that great '72 intensity and edge, a bunch of new (soon to be classic) songs that haven't become old for them yet, and the first glimpse of the more improvisationally tight '74 style.\n\nA+ performance, A/A- quality",

I had attended the Maples show a week prior and that was a rock fest.\n\nThe version of HC Sunshine is so over the top, far ranging yet but gathering in, it would be hard to discern the album cut over it, but because of its intendant jam it just goes into the exact areas we never thought possible. Thereby, the unexpected frees the soul.\n\nAs I am listening to Dark Star, outside my window, municipal fireworks go off adding their flash  into the conflagration of a tepid evening sky. The finishing touch is a decapitating Phil solo that leads into a hint of the same chording that graces HC Sunshine/Midnight Hour and floods the night with Eyes.\n\nWhen by 1977 they would have quickly ended with a few more songs, the Dead pile-drive right into almost like a third set without taking a break. And every square or round inch of it is impeccably played while holding onto the muse's hand of forthright, yet gracious, improv. \n\nA jammed-to-the-max Eyes lends itself to Mind Left\nand cascading down Everest finely links back up with the trail and into China Doll. This version acts as a bit of a rest period for the three guitarists. And then they kick royal ass throughout the rest of the show.\n\nI tell ya, for a Fourth of July, this was all the fireworks I needed. This is a 5 star performance. I had to downgrade the overall rating because the sound is not quite up to snuff, but it is passable",

I love it :)  Jerry's riffs on El Paso are truly interstellar,  the Here Comes Sunshine Jam is the best I've ever had the privilege of being turned on to :)  The Darkstar-->Eyes-->China Doll is simply amazing!!!  I remember playing hackey-sack when I was in college and putting this tape in the box.  One of the guys asked me, \"Are there any words (lyrics) on this tape?\"  he he, he just wasn't getting the point...\n\nThe famous American Prophet, Edgar Cayce, said once, in one of his trances, that every thought ever thought in the history of the universe is recorded in the universal mind.  I am looking forward to finding out what Jerry was thinking about during the hyper-drive jam in Darkstar from this show.

Yes, the usual UJB tweak to be sure but one day outta no-where we took it way way down and slurried it around a bit and out spooged Mountain Jam ala Allmans based on the old Donovan song.

Mountain Jam to be sure.

It goes out into outer space and gets stuck on a ring on Saturn and can't get off. Try to contemplate these lyrics:\n\nWake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine,\nGet out the pans, don't just stand there dreamin'\nGet out of the way, get out of the way,\n\nHere comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.\n\nLine up a long shot maybe try it two times, maybe more,\nGood to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor,\nWhy hold out for more?\n\nHere comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.\n\nAskin' you nice, now, keep the mother rollin'\nOne more time, been down before,\nYou just don't have to go no more, no more.\n\nHere comes sunshine, here comes sunshine.\n\n\nHere are a few more thoughts I have while listening to this song:\n\nI feel like I'm caught on the ripple of a pond from a freshly thrown stone... up and down I go with reverberations and echoes ringing in my head until what I thought was infinity is casually reunited with the present reality.\n\nYou have to listen in the right frame of mind and analyze the consciousness/madness.\n\nDark Star is inventive and unanticipated. I think it is largely due to Billy or Mickey's rat-a-tat-tat on the symbols. Ting-tang-ting they ring. And then Phil took it along a journey through the woods up and down winding paths (Even made me get up and move closer to the other \"phil side\" speaker).\n\nLike sliding down the back of a penguin...\n\nThe \"Eyes of the World\" seems like it collapses. A bunch of people standing around a sink whole saying, \"Where did the the sound go?\" and then, as it begins to swirl like quicksand in an hour glass, it erupts out into a volcanic jam with smooth veins of hot lava meandering down the mountain into a pool which is called, \"China Doll.\" Lava is funny. you can see it coming a mile away. It moves quite slowly. But as it burns and keeps away the yearning of such turning away.  The China Doll could be felt through the whole jam! It wails like a calling from a far away stable... calling the horses home. Consider the following lines:\n\"All I leave behind me is only what I found\"\nand\n\"Take up your china doll, take up your china doll,\nit's only fractured and just a little nervous from the fall.\"\n\nWith the coolest, cool down... My darlin' Sugaree! Just don't tell them that you know of me.\n\n-TDT",

Grow up - let's enjoy the fact we have this wonderul archive to enjoy all this fantastic music for free.  This site is for STREAMING people - period.  Why all the greed?  I have 2000 hours of cassettes been trading since 1981, you don;t see me whining do you? I risked my life on the road for these guys and saw 92 shows, most in '84-'86, do you see me complaining?  Of course not, we enjoy what we have.  Why can't you people enjoy it for what is designed for instead of - like Bill Graham says on 4.29.71 - being spoiled little ---- all the time and always wanting more, more, more.  The Dead were not about that folks -the Dead were about enjoying what we have.  So please - let;s stop the complaints, use the site as it is designed, and keep the comments positive before someone takes this awesome site away from us. If you feel you must download then you have horrible internet access, a lame cell phone, are technically challenged and need serious training, or all of the above.  I can naccess this site anytime anywhere and stream away and enjoy it, and everyone else can to if they just get the training, its very basic for the 21st century.\n\nGreat Eyes, its stunning how well they played that song even in its infant stages.

The review section really pops out at you on this website, so I think that it's easy to become focused on it, and the review section is starting to lose the spirit of what it's meant for because of the focus on it. It's probably not something that's on the top of archive.org's list of things to change, but this is just a shout out and suggestion for us that we bring back the purpose of the review section and put the value back on writing solid reviews specifically about the performance, production quality, or anything at all that isn't bickering between reviews or making generalized statements about the other reviews written here.  This review probably seemed a little cunty... and technically hypocritical. But I am willing to wager that you, like me, would love to read a review section with more reviews on the music and upload than reviews on reviews.",
