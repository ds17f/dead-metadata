Hence I only went to a this one of this run and only a few this year for which I was given free tickets, this and Monterey!\n     Plus this only has the 2nd set with board quality here therefore I can only give it a 3!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

I'll give it a 5 star for playin and 4 stars for quality.",

      "review_text": "Strictly business AUD for the first set and the SBD for the second. I would have chosen the SBD for both sets, but it's source seemingly starts with the commencement of the second set.\n\n1st Set: Loud crowd roaring interaction during \"LTGTR.\" It's an average version but certainly an appropriate welcoming intro. At first \"Franklin's\" is a little dull but it opens up to life several moments throughout. Whatever rust has accrued from 45 days of non-performing, they seem willing to scrape off...Bobby's almost saying 'c'mon' during \"Masterpiece.\" We haven't heard \"Jack\" in awhile but this isn't the cleanest version. \"Walkin\" is akin to heavy boots sloshing, but it's buoyant enough to still move and shake. It's a little dull, however, til the clap-along and the fun sliiide wheening its way out. \"High Time\" asks for little else than the uncomplicated pleasures of two individuals thoroughly enjoying each others' company. Therefore, that modest reversion to more linear tunes helps push this version over the top. \"Cassidy\" perks up proceedings, my goodness, those Brent searing synths through the late 4's/5's are attention grabbing. \"Ease\" is fine enough, despite some volume fluctuations, to finsih off this 'rehearsal' 1st set. \n\n2nd Set: Brent's ever growing menu of mind-twirling sounds make me immediately smile as \"Scarlet\" arrives. Unfortunately, that's the most novel aspect of this otherwise mellow version. However, the intricate jam comes together nicely, setting up for a consistently c+/B- \"Fire\" that although never pops, has steady pacing and keen quietly dynamic work setting up the 9's letting free. \"Estimated\" awkwardly breathes into existance filled with errors, (should they have gone into \"California\" at 2:03, or waited til 2:16 when it happened?) Thankfully the bridge is ok...mostly cause Brent dominates with his laser-inducing boards. The jam is a chill head turning foot stomper which surprisingly leads to a pretty segue into \"Eyes.\" The reading of the song is a pretty standard affair but the jams out of are quite lovely, Jerry being egged by a repeatedly delightful series of small Phil bombs...Brent eventually catches up in the mid 7's... from 6:45-8:00 it's as good of an \"Eyes\" outro jam I've heard all year in '88. \"Drums/Space\" pass smoothly into a mild-mannered \"The Wheel.\" the words on \"Gimme\" come in quicker than expected, but it's a good-time song. \"Wharf\" is a decent, somber run-through but despite Jerry's valient attempts  this \"Watchtower\" lacks fire. \n\n\"US Blues\" is typically the selection when the band feels apathetic.\n\n2 1/2 stars rounded down because it left me blah",

      "review_text": "Let the good times roll indeed So stoked to be back in California, especially in So-Cal in December.The Santa Ana winds were a sweet balm after missing the Southern tour for personal reasons and percolating in D.C. since the the end of Fall tour.I seem to recall it being a snap decision to fly out to Cal, much to my girlfriend's chagrin.Little did she (or I) know that I would see every show the Grateful Dead played from tonight until July 18th 1990 in Deer Creek, a run of 115 straight shows.Rick and Roger were already in Southern California, up to who knows what, and they picked me up from LAX wearing stoned grins.I could feel the stress of flying with drugs wearing off and I just knew that this was all I was going to do from now on, I'd been straining at the bit to throw caution to the wind and just go, from that point on it was full on tour.Highlights were LBPD not busting me for that sack of buds and a blistering 1st set kicking off with Let The Good Times Roll that was highlighted by a rare Jack-A-Roe.Onward we go.",

I know 'cause I was in the front row.  Does this sound like a guy going throught the motions??????\n\nAt the time of this gig the Hills of LA were in flames so the song choice had special resonance for the area.  The Estimated was spooky as hell that night also given the locale.  High Time was glorious.  Will you naysayers and snobs please give it a rest?  It may not have been '81  but I'm sure there were people watchin' that Long Beach '81 China>Rider saying \"Gee, this isn't as good as the smokin' Good Lovin' I saw the The Pig do back in the day.\"\n\nEat my stars, my lovelies!!",

AMAZING is all I can say. Being new to the dead, this show will forever be a part of me, so good.\nReview of the show: High energy.. Anyone that was there will agree with me. I sat up in the nose blead seats, peering down on what was a simple but amazing spectacle. I always wonder if the band was as high as I was, it's as if they new what everyone was thinking and what everyone wanted. Thank you so much for the memory.",

This was mine and a friend of mine that didn't have a choice in coming with me because it was her  pre-christmas present.  First thoughts were skeptical as we sat in the nosebleed area, well I sat, my friend danced frequently turning to me \"Oh my god can't you feel that?\" The energy was high and I was only one in the auditorium who was sitting down feeling miserable.  Then Jerry did his thing whatever not even sure what he did, next thing I knew I was on my feet, dancing and have been dancing ever since.  Listen to them every day since then.  Think I saw a ghost in the girls restroom dressed in no other than a freakish outfit from the 60's, yes, gogo boots, short brown skirt and checkered shirt, perhaps she was paying her respects to the band but whatever we left that auditorium as one and floated in the cosmos that night...literally.
