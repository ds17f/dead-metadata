Recording quality to me is really quite acceptable, and the musical value is worth the trouble of diddling w/ the EQ.  Jer and the band really let it fly.  Kinda surprising to hear them sounding this advanced so early in '67.  Funny, the \"distracting flute\" and the rapping guy (anyone knows who was on stage?) make this \"forgettable\" Schoolgirl a unique event; a free-form outdoors Acid Test.  Bongos anyone?",

After Jerry says \"I guess it doesn't matter anyway\" they go into a nice little jam that sounds very soothing to the ears. It's really cool that this early on in their career and the first time they played it live, morning dew could sound soo damn good.\nThe viola lee here is pretty interesting. Like said before, it's nothing special, just some free-form fun.\nThe good morning little schoolgirl is def. a throwaway version. The flute really distracts from how awesome their set was.\n\nThe sound quality isn't as bad as people say. It can be a little muddy and there's a decent amount of hiss, but it's not unlistenable. It actually adds to the nostalgic feeling. \nThis is worth the download, if for nothing else but the fact that you're listening to the friggin be-in man! How cool is that!?",

      "review_text": "The Human Be-in This was a bright and legendarily cosmic day that brought every freak in the Haight out to the Polo Fields -- an energized, magical location that Phil likens to Avebury in England  -- \nbeyond the historical interest of this show, it's a killer performance. The sound for the premier of Morning Dew is gorgeous.The other two tracks, btw are out of order. You can hear them launch into Viola Lee at the end of Schoolgirl.\nThe Dead are joined onstage during Schoolgirl by the great Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Charles Lloyd. All the musicians shared a huge inspiration from John Coltrane and it's interesting to hear Charles' sparkling bursts of notes pushing out against the Dead's surging intensity here. Eventually Charles launches into a passionate rave that really seems appropriate to that time and place... the boys were obviously psyched up after that because they just shred Viola Lee to pieces... 1967 took off to a good start that day.\nMuch thanks to the Archive, it's so wonderful to hear this historic event, a crossing of the new musical streams in the late 60s and in many ways a peak moment of that time period.\nThis is also the show where Dizzy Gillespie turned to Ralph Gleason and asked, \"who are these guys? They sure can swing.\"",

The flute is likely played by Ron Thelin, who was the owner of the Psychedlic Shop and an instrumental figure in the growth of the San Francisco scene. While we sit here straight and criticize, the vibe their was everything goes so I'm sure no one noticed.

On the following morning I hitchhiked to Golden Gate Park from Lafayette, hitchhiked back to Lafayette after the Be-In, then drove with friends to the Fillmore later in the evening. I was a short-haired, freshfaced, innocent 17 and a senior in high school, but I had been around the burgeoning hip scene enough to fit in. I was also familiar with the Beatnik scene on Telegraph Ave in Berkeley and also had mistakenly attended an Acid Test in San Jose thinking that I was going to one of my brother's fraternity parties. \n\nAt the Be-In I was fairly close to stage right and remember the GD's and the JA's sets and both were amazingly loud even though by 1968 P.A. systems would dwarf what was used at the Be-In. I seem to recall also, that there were sound problems. The whole affair was quite an eye-opener for a young kid seeing his first pair of naked female breasts, but it was warm and I took my jacket off and danced in herky-jerky motions like everybody else. People around me shared sandwiches and cokes. No one dosed me, and, though people were smoking joints, no one offered me any.\n\nAll in all, it was an easygoing afternoon of music, but I didn't care for the political gobbledeegook between sets. During those early days of free concerts in the park it seemed as though there was always someone spouting great swirling speeches about the atrocities with which the establishment was dousing the hip world. They seemed to come out of the woodwork if an open microphone materialized. Most all of us who attended free shows did not relish the between set rhetoric. All we wanted was the music. To get the music you had to endure speeches. \n\nThis is not a good recording, but it suffices for historical reckoning and is good enough to sit through. Charles Llyod plays flute with the Dead during Schoolgirl and sings and scats different lyrics to the song. You can also hear Phil screaming \"slow down\" near the end of Schoolgirl. They slow quickly to a stop.\n\nBy listening to this, I can actually feel that warm sunshine on my face and the overall sunny disposition of the crowd.\n\nWarm weather in San Francisco in January is not all that out of the ordinary. It can be quite a bit more pleasant in January than a windswept and foggy July day out in the avenues on the edge of the continent.\n\nThen again, we weren't there for the sunshine, or the music, or the sandwiches, or the speeches. We were there because being there was on the edge. It was the place to be.\n\nThis show merits two stars because of its significance and because it is not as bad, in context, as other recordings I've heard on this site.",

No way.  No how.  I don't believe it was recorded outdoors at any venue.  Based on the sounds of the instruments, Bobby's playing, the presence of the two drummers, and the sound of Jerry's guitar I'm saying sometime in the summer of '68.\n\nIt is, however, one of the very best versions of Dew ever, equal to the fantastic 5-6-70 version at least.  How about that falsetto vocal before the final jam?  Love IT.\n\nIf you want to hear Billy drumming all by his awesome self, check out the Viola Lee which follows the Dew -- obviously recorded at a different time and venue.

It's better than many of the other 1967 Dews here at Archive.org. It also compares well with other '60's Dews, including the sweet 1968 recording on Two from the Vault. Not all first performances are good: the first Me and My Uncle from November 1966 is quite awful.\n\nBut there is more significance to this Morning Dew. It is the earliest instance of a sound that is recognizably Grateful Dead. What a contrast from even the previous month of December 1966. For the first time,  Jerry finds his vocal style, not apparent in any of the '66 shows at Archive.org (I've listened to them all.) Also for the first time, Jerry finds a guitar style and sound that is recognizable as Grateful Dead. The 1966 stuff is great fun, and some of it quite good -- the soulful blues, the Beatles-like and surfer-like pop, the twangy guitar, great Pigpen vocals -- but this Dew is the Dead.\n\nHere, the Cream Puff jam has it's moments. The School Girl bit is interesting because it gives you an idea of what it might have been like in Golden Gate Park that day at the Human Be-in. This was no rock concert.",

      "review_text": "Morning Dew Paragraph number 1: Perfection\nThere is no such thing as perfection, no matter how great something may be. Something can uplift us, something may make us give our lives a complete 360 turn around. Even music isn't perfect. If it were perfect, we would listen to one song every day for the rest of our lives and never grow tired of it. And to prove that perfection does not exist, I will say that I have not listened to Morning Dew from 1-14-67 in more than seven months. Why? Because I don't want to spoil what I feel to be the closest thing any musician has ever come to perfection or, what I call, contact with the super (super powerful, super unknown, super beings, or supreme beings).\nThe debut: When the Human Be-In took place, it was something out of the ordinary. It was the garden of Eden with the Tree Of Knowledge still bearing her apple. It was a mental picture book of our first families wandering around through Africa gazing towards a morrow of uncertainty. It was Robin Hood and His Merry Band of Thieves using guitars instead of bows and giving music to all of the people. It was a cross between Son House playing Delta Blues along a Mississippi lakeside, John Coltrane channeling a love supreme at Birdland, and a child's birthday party. Of all the bands who played at the Human Be-In, only Jefferson Airplane had had a record out and gone 4 lineup changes in the past two years. All of the other bands, Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Charlatans, and Country Joe & The Fish had yet to record an album. The Human Be-In, which attracted several thousand people, may be the biggest concert in history to feature rock bands in their innocence when what they played was free and fast without the iron hands of middlemen to put them down. \n2. Pig Pen\nI am here to discuss Morning Dew. I will not be discussing the talented flute improvisation of Charles Lloyd from the Modern Jazz Quartet, nor will I discuss Phil's lead vocal at the end of Viola Lee Blues. I have been left wondering about the absence of Pig Pen. I have seen pictures of him at the Be-In, but there is no evidence that he appears on the recording (the harmonica on Schoolgirl is played by a homeless guy) nor does he appear in the few photographs of the band on stage. \n3. Morning Dew\nWhen I first heard Morning Dew, I nearly cried. I felt like I had gone back to some childhood memory. I could see roses unfolding, morning rain, joy, and I felt like I was alive. It brought into mind what Henry Miller said about music in Tropic Of Capricorn,\n\"Music is interplanetary fire. It is the slate writing of the Gods.\"\n4. Why Is This Song Not Perfect?\nBecause they are playing with such emotion that Garcia makes an awkward mistake towards the end of the song. It will never bother me though. I have experienced the closes thing to perfection.",

      "review_text": "This could only happen while listening to the Dead After watching the News on PBS I put this Dew on and before I could turn the TV off who should appear on the TV screen but Oppenheimer and  a shot of a nuclear explosion.\nIf my history is correct \"Morning Dew\" was the first folk song to deal with a potential nuclear holocaust. Told from the perspective of two survivors much like the CSN song \"Wooden Ships\". \nThe tale of two characters was a favorite song vehicle for the Dead, take \"Jack Straw\" for instance and the most famous song with a tale of two is \"All Along The Watchtower\".\n I have seen and listened to my share of Dews and if this is indeed the first one played at the Human Be-In it is quite a relaxed version for that time period. If it is , it truly is the birth of Dead music. The ride out in Dew is exactly what the Dead was all about; formlessness inside the form. Good examples are \"Dark Star\", of course, and later \"Playing in the Band\" which starts out with form and dissolves into formlessness within the form and then back into form. A musical metaphor for a trip. I always thought the Dead were at there best when they were playing \"nothing\". Such as a formless transition from one song to another. Those moments never lasted long enough.\n Back to the Dew, given it's nuclear theme, a powerful place to see the Dead perform this song was at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. Due to the fact that the nuclear bomb was invented at the Lawrence Laboratory in the Berkeley hills just above the Greek Theater. My favorite of all the Greek Dews was 7/15/88. What a Friday night it was. But as far as this Dew is concerned it is quite incredible. 5 stars for historical context and musically a great Dew and Viola Lee.

No organ is more likely to be mid '68 IMHO (perhaps this is when Pigpen began to lose interest and TC was yet to arrive?).

Just started reading Phil's book Searching for the Sound. He talks about this show and mentions that the power went out during Morning Dew which doesn't happen on this recording. I'm convinced this Dew is no older than September '67 due to the Gong-Mickey Hart. The sound on this song is 1968 to my ears.",
