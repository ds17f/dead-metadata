Bishop sit in for Jerry for most of it, and from the get-go he pushes the band...harder faster more. \"Checkin' up on my baby\" has the kids in the band playing straighter blues than anywhere else I've heard...and at one point Elvin has to admonish the band not to 'blow it' they're so ready to push into overdrive. Bishop's vocals are soulful and his guitar tone is go-for-the throat. All this plus the classic 'green grass' and an early M&MU make this little show a keeper.  \n\nSound quality for this era is good, not comparable to late 70's obviously, but more than listenable.",

Phil Lesh later said that one could taste the acid in there!! Phil said that when it came time to play, he was so zonked that he had to be propped against an amp and he thought his bass was some strange artifact with fish-scale strings!\nLater, Robert Hunter had a freak out and saw lobster people and Janis Joplin was belching blood! After the show, they had to have Jerry play some soothing guitar for Robert until he calmed down!\nJust thinking about how amazing stoned those guys must have been while they played is ammusing to say the least.

I'm a little surprised that with all of the excitement about a 46 minute Lovelight, nobody seems to have commented on the obvious cut at ~ 33:25, after which there's a clear tonal change in the vocals, and a sudden inclusion of a long sustain note on guitar (presumably Jerry, but with all that's going on in this gig who can be sure?). Although it's quite obvious, I don't see any mention of a splice in the notes, the txt files of either of the archive.org versions or in Deadlists, so I'm a little suspicious that perhaps somebody got a little creative with the source tapes and people have been too gaga at \"witnessing history\" to notice the shooter hanging out over there on the grassy knoll....\n\nHaving said that, the Smokestack w/Elvin Bishop is certainly a rare treat :-)",

Crazy weird cool shit.\n\nALSO, I believe the record books need revising. I\u2019ve always held PITB 5/21/74, at 46:26 or so, to be #1 longest single song. This Lovelight has it beat by a solid half minute. Ahem.\n\nEDIT: Just went back to the tapes. I actually happened to listen to this PITB two days ago - no cuts noted, and the last note fades out around 46:21. Haven\u2019t listened to this LL yet but assuming no cuts, last note finished by 46:20. I\u2019m wrong by about one second, but it\u2019s pretty damn close.
