Poor europeans.\nBefore that I'd seen the GD at Rockpalast on german TV in 1981.\nIn 1990 I was very familiar with rock 'n' roll concerts in german venues, especially Zappa, who visited Germany periodical.\nAt that night in Essen I wondered where all these barefooted people - male and female - in long hippie garment are coming from. Now mark it was 1990 and it was october - pretty cold in Germany at that time. Nobody could answered me what these people are doing in the day-time. Very funny.\nBy the way - it was a great concert. !!! And the beginning of a great passion. Lucky that these are wonderful versions of Maggie's farm and Sugaree, not to forget Drums & Space. High time and the rest is also remarkable.\nIn these times - without Garcia and Zappa - I take comfort with Mr. Dylan, who is touring often in this area. Where is Tom Petty ? At lenght in the Grugahalle 1992.",

The show impressed me much, I would have liked to follow the tour to Berln, Frankft, Hambg. Relistening it now and comparing with other live material that I know it's clear that it was not really a top-show, but very dense and moving in the second part, specially from Black Peter on (I was lucky they played my favorites, \"China cat...-I know you rider\", Truckin\" and at the end: \"Knocking...!\" - good versions).",

But there are some other notable 10.17's, like 81-84, and of course, this the first (though hardly the brightest) of many Europe 90 nuggets. \n\nThe opening of the Europe tour, the show that proceeds this, 10.13.90, Stockholm is pretty much agreed to be less than noteworthy, if not quite awful. Some of that is undoubtedly the lack of Mr. Honsby\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s presence, or perhaps given the other side of that same coin, the more noticeable presence and sensibility of Mr. Welnick who seems to musically deflate everyone, particularly Jerry.

Weir is actually convincing on falsetto backup vocals here. Again the drummers are key here, not letting this tune open too far into spacey zones, the result is a resolute performance that really builds towards the end of the song. \n\nCassidy, the perennial second-set preview, is the most promising number of the evening so far. The piano and guitars are producing mounds of fractal sparkles. Phil who isn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t otherwise too conspicuous in the first set brings a set of repeating bass chords that seem provide both a musical center to follow, and a challenge of sorts. This makes for a great, if short, exploratory segment. Had the Grateful Dead an editor, the set would likely end here. Instead we have an average Tenn Jed and Picasso Moon, both staring Bruce Hornsby and played with conviction if nothing else. \n\nSecond set lines up with China > Rider in hand, with Weir turning in something of a lead through the first verse. The China starts a little light out of the gate, but by the second minute or so, we have the full works in motion to great effect, by the time we hit Rider, Phil\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s back in the front of the mix, dare I even say the band, leading with his bass, there\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s less challenge here than outright direction.

Right off, Bucket>Sugaree, Minglewood, Me & Uncle, all predestrianly good. Then,  My first Maggie's Farm. The Dead's \"Cumberland\"  is very similar to this Dylan song and what's unique this night is that everyone shares singing a verse, ala Bluegrass ~ I really love that.  A wonderful not-oft played High Times follows.  Jerry's and Bob's guitars are so prominent in the mix; clarity abounds.  Jerry sings it well, but it suffers an abrupt ending.  Cassidy could go a lot further but it is solid and Tennessee is pretty good.  Picasso Moon, a much-dissed song, is well-played, as usual.  But the sound on this recording is so delicious and the recording has ear-correcting separation. You can hear every note from all seven.  Someone once remarked that Healy pissed off the GD and fans with his effects tomfoolery, but he sure could capture this band live. The fact remains, that regardles of what song they played, they just sounded so good playing it that you think you've looked past flubs and don't care.   China>Rider. Truckin>He's Gone.  Fabulous Truckin'  This sounds so good, it even sounds good low.  Other than some hiss, it goes down real nice, real easy.  It is a very good show, performance-wise.  A beautiful concert.  And it sounds like Jerry strapped on the \"Wolf\" that evening!  Glorious, unpretentious flowing sound and awesome glistering Guitars! Jerry just lets it fly.  This is Grateful Dead as I like it. Feckless a-band-on and every moment catching up with itself, but, catching up every time, just in time.  An absolutely amazing drums/space>Wheel>Miracle>Black Peter. Jerry's guitar=rich cream strat honk. He hits all his marks.\nCuttin' Heads, Charlie, Cuttin' Heads. You can hear Bobby perfectly in the side pocket and Vince does not offend. Hornsby? Just pure chords/inserts (see).  Come on, man, you cannot appreciate this totally marvelous Black Peter? It is soul wrenching!  Black Peter.  A raging Black Peter. Totally epic. Then a flawless transition into Love Lights, an old Pigpen standard rejuvenated by Bobby. Heaven's Door so remarkably clear and vibrant ~ like you never heard it before, y'know?\n  \nevan  s.  hunt",

Was living in Europe, going through Dead withdrawal (although made more then bearable by hanging around with all of the 20 or so of the Swiss deadheads), when the Dead decided to follow me.  Coming up the escalators to the venue, suddenly transforming from a fairly dreary environment to the magic of the deadworld, running into old friends I hadn't seen for years, primed me for a great show.  And the Dead came through! Smoothly transitioning between moods, the show was both mellow and energized at the same time.  Blissed-out, while there were long dancing periods where I'm sure my feet didn't touch the ground.  Cassidy was particulary memorable for a feeling of infinitely-layered laid-back complexity.

Most people had skipped out on Sweden so this was kind of like the first stop and everyone was jazzed since it was the first show, I was blown away immediately by the small size of the venue - what a dream, after places like Giants Stadium and JFK. And the music was spot on. Whatever they played was great - and Black Peter - not my favorite jam - was probably the song I  loved most. And Maggie's Farm was awesome too. This was one of those shows where that, if you could only see one show, this would be it. The archival recording is a nice souvenir but you really had to be there. Should mention that there were hardly any Germans at any of these shows.  It was like being at a show in the states.",
