Bruce has a field day during scarlet, riffing on top of everything...he begins steering the ship into victim land at about 5 and a half minutes into scarlet, and it only gets more interesting from there. at the end of victim bobby attempts to steer it into bucket, but to no avail as phil begins plundering ahead with the beginning notes of fire. i wore my analog copy of this show out, and I am SO glad to have this pristine copy now. viva la archive.org!!!",

      "review_text": "hornsby-ariffic It's funny that Bruce Hornsby says his biggest problem with the GD was that it was so inconsistent. After hearing this show you can see why he said that...this show is so damn smokin', much more so than the average '91 show. There is no doubt that they were chanelling the great spirit on this fine summer night. Phils bass problem during Jack Straw is weird, but novel in it's uniqueness. Dan Healy must have had a field day trying to sort it out. It doesnt seem to stop the band from tearing through the Jack Straw -> Bertha opener. Hornsby is in control here, almost forcing Jerry to rise to the occasion. Naturally, the first set Dark Star was a real treat. \nSecond Set's Scarlet->Victim->Fire seemed to blend together so naturally. Hornsby starts turning the Scarlet ending lick into a Victim modulation mid way through the typical transition jam. Gorgeous! This is a first rate show for an era of Grateful Dead music. I for one (IMHO) think that 90's GD rocked in a more progressive palette pushing style than any time before. Maybe that's cause I was there in '91 and wasnt even born for 69-70.",

      "review_text": "8-16-91 I think a big reason behind all the 5 star ratings here is b/c of the novelty of 1st set Dark Star (1st one since '71), as well as the novelty of the Scarlet>Victim>Fire sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great show, but I just don't think that it is one of the best 3 of the year as one has stated, or even if it merits more than 4 stars. It is well played, but IMHO, a little lacking in energy for how hot this particular configuration got in 1991. The Dark Star is probably the shortest one of the year clocking in at about 10 minutes. It is good, but had it been a second set Dark Star, I don't think it would have stood out as any better than the other 91 Dark Stars. I think the Scarlet>Victim>Fire thing is kinda cool, but the post Scarlet jamming is not existent, which was one of the best transition's for Jerry and Bruce to play off eachother. Jerry does do some nice work at the 5:40ish mark on Victim and at the end.\nAs well, there is some nice stuff from Jerry towards the end of Fire, but there are plenty of longer and more jamming Fire's from 1991. The SOTM is riddled with forgotten verses and segments where the song pretty much trainwrecks. I would make the argument that this SOTM is one of the worst on 1991. IMHO though, the band just wasn't rocking as hard as they did for the majority of 91. To me it's kinda the same as the Music>Sugaree>Music at Shoreline 94, it looks great on paper, but it was pretty average in reality.\n\nSound quality is good, but not great. Some Drums are very distant, and Vince is mixed way back. As well Jerry's guitar is mixed pretty far back too (listen to All Over Now, during Hornsby and Vince's solo's and several other tunes, you can't hear Jer at all). And that's my two cents.",

The boys rip a great Jack Straw - Bertha opener, but Phil's bass is doing this thwangy thing that kinda blemishes the greatness. It's the Scarlet-Victim-Fire that really stands out. The transitions into and out of Victim are mind-bendingly smooth and coordinated.  Phil comes into Fire with such great energy, propelling the band into a very unique and inspiring rendition of the song. Jerry's vocals are uncommonly clear and forceful ala Morning Dew of the next night.  The band finds a timeless groove.  Spectacular stuff. 4 stars b/c rest of show is anticlimax after unreal Scarlet-Victim-Fire.  All in all, better than many shows that people have rated with 5 stars.",

      "review_text": "Worst Dark Star? Oh please....it's cool to not feel the vibe of certain shows, but to flat out bag on a show, especially a show in which the boys are clearly being creative and having fun is a clueless move.  SOTM is the high point of this show?!?  Some people need to take a break for a while, me thinks, and get a little perspective.  The Dark Star in addition to being a great choice in to start the close of the first set, kicks off with a great run from Jerry.  Think he is not feeling it?  Go back and listen again.  Jerry does have juice in this Dark Star, which cannot be quantified by usual standards and measurements.  10 minutes, yes.  But it is the FIRST SET.  Talk about seeing the glass half empty. And there is much interplay between Jer and Bruce, that goes double when it is in the framework of a first set song.  It does hold up well to many modern-era Dark Stars, IMO, regardless of placement...I would take this type of first set over many, many others from the 1990's.  Maybe I am biased as I was there rocking out, and leaping and freaking from the first tuning notes of Dark Star, or maybe it's because I've never been a jaded Dead Snob.",
