However, this is the hottest Eleven that I've ever heard.  Perhaps even my #1 Grateful Dead moment ever.  Jerry and Phil just don't stop.  My only problem with this copy is that William Tell and the beginning jam are part of St. Stephen on this copy, preventing a quick fast forward to the outer limits.  5 stars for THE Eleven, 3 for the rest of the show.",

      "review_text": "Excellent Performance! This is a great performance by the band and a reminder of why I love the music of the Dead so much from this particular year. They start right off the bat with Lovelight and though it takes a little while for the band to groove, it turns out to be a great version which actually is only the beginning. After a bit of chaos, they launch into Me And My Uncle and then Doin' That Rag which really works. Rag is done well and contains some great jamming before they give way to He Was A Friend Of Mine. This version is sweet and contains a nice Garcia solo. Next, bookended by a couple of China Cat Sunflower teases, is Dire Wolf. It's probably the weakest point of the show IMHO.\n\nNext up is the stuff of legends if you ask me. A nice, though compact, Dark Star is played in pretty typical 1969 fashion which leads into a very muscular St. Stephen. Following on the heels of Stephen is one of the best, jammed out versions of The Eleven that I have heard. Very well played by all, especially Garcia, Weir and Lesh. The song just cascades before shifting back into Lovelight number 2. This leads to an oddly placed but unique drum solo before falling back into Lovelight number 3 for the infamous vocal jam finale. This song is without a doubt Pigpen's, there is no doubt about it but if it wasn't for the manic vocals of Weir at the end of each and every version I have heard, I don't think the song would be near as memorable and this version is certainly no exception.\n\nAn energetic, fun, psychedelic rock and roll show that really shouldn't be missed by GD fans and fans of the band from this particular era.",

      "review_text": "St. Stephen > The Eleven I don't know that I could ever pick any version of The Eleven as my favorite, but this one would definitely be in the running.  It isn't as tight as the Live/Dead version, but the transition into the main Eleven theme and the first part of the Eleven jam have got to be among the most amazing few minutes of music the Dead ever played.  That isn't to say the rest of the song here isn't excellent as well.  It's just that the first few minutes of music following William Tell are so freakin' intense.\n\nSimilarly, I would say the St. Stephen here is among the better versions I've heard.  It's very tight and rockin'.  It does, however, suffer from a very brief (less than a full second?) drop out between the lines \"spinning that curious sense of your own\" and \"Can you answer? Yes I can\" at the very end of the song.  I don't think it is mentioned in the text file.  This may not bother most people, but it throws me every time I hear it for some reason.\n\nThe remainder of the show is well played.  I wouldn't place this on quite the same level as, say, 2-28-69, because there just isn't enough show here.  There is no Other One, Alligator, Caution, etc.  I also don't think the music on the first disc is quite as inspired as the jam on disc 2.  Still, I'd say this show is definitely worth checking out for fans of 1969; and it is an absolute must-have for any fan of St. Stephen > The Eleven.",

This probably is the best \"Eleven\" I've ever heard. They go OFF! And Jerry just keeps coming up with mind melting runs up and down the fret. This is \"goosebump\" material. They are just charged. The whole Lovelight wrapping throughout the show is rare. I can't think of another show where they replicate this. I wouldn't be surprised if they clean this one up and release it as a Dick's Picks.

      "review_text": "Dosed Again ! This show has been widely traded for some time, and it usually shows up in the 1969 top ten in Deadbase surveys. One listen and it's easy to see why!\nFans of Pigpen - this is the show for you. Basically a \"Dark Star sandwich\" with 2, count 'em TWO Lovelights as the \"bun\".\nThey burst out of the starting gate with Lovelight #1, full of fire and funk, and it's obvious that Jerry is ready to cook tonight! A gutsy Me & My Uncle follows, then a tight version of Doin That Rag with some nice Jerry soloing at the end. Then the Friend of Mine, not usually a standout, is here just played to perfection. A chill-producing version where even the vocals and harmonies are spot on. Only the Byrds could top this version, or maybe not !\nAn early, tentative rendition of Dire Wolf points forward to Workingman's and the Dead-about-to-be.\nThen, it's time to put on your space helmet and achive orbit. Not the longest Dark Star, but certainly one of the best for 1969. Different themes and styles explored by Jerry make this one rather unique. Plenty of texture to keep your ears busy - bells, gongs, backwards-sounding guitar, feedback and tasty jamming by all.\nSt. Stephen really smokes, and here includes the William Tell seque into an incredible Eleven. This is definitely one of the best for 1969, tight and rhythmically complex with sparkling runs by Phil and Jerry.\nThere aren't many great SBD's from the summer of 1969 available yet- all the more reason to download this one! The sound quality is B+, a little muddy but well balanced. Highly recommended!\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

It's very difficult to pick best versions, and there are a hell of a lot of good lovelights out there...But, this show's manic energy is through the roof, and the eleven in this show is the definition of the first, best, and most creative jam band there ever was or will be. \n\nI challenge anyone out there to count the eleven time throughout this version and focus on Jerry's guitar at the same time. Good f***ing luck. On top of the crazy time and unbelievable jamming, he's coming in on different beats. I don't know how the band kept up, but i suppose that was the best job to have, keeping up with Jerry. It's light years beyond fluid.",

This is by far the greatest lovelight ever preformed. After the epic 26:27 minute  lovelight the me & my uncle is probably the greatest one from 1969, of all time not but top three. the din that rag vas valiant but nothing compared to the opener. But the he was the friend of mine is probably one one of the vest versions i\u2019ve ever heard Jerry's playing impeccable and you fell the lost as he saying \u201cnow he\u2019s dead and gone\u201d like he is singing about his father beautiful to the very end. The Dark star in so spacy and an amazing version you hear phils base leads the spacy trip with his rhythmic  bass and completes one of the best of what 69 offered by phil an tom on the keys.  one of my favorite parts is of weirs  \u201cscreeching feedback\u201d as you are their in the mindset of what is the Dark Star. The st. stephen to eleven is insane as well again lesh driven intertwined with the remarkable playing of jerry during those extended solos. and probably the greatest eleven ever played!. The en they do their magic and bring it back with what a lovelight reprise that is juat as good as ever pigs voice oars over the tune that we all love as lolelight.  half way throu  you hear that a drumbs is coming and when they just break out into a drumbs that was compact yet worth as much a a 15 minute drumbs. i love how they yell ya, ya, ya, ya, and then they do their magic for the final time its a 7 minute lovelight reprise and and epic ender to what this dead head considers the Greatest Show of all time and the greatest lovelight ever played by the grateful dead. This show was on my birthday and if i were alive back then it would have been the single greatest hour and 50 minutes of my life. \n\n_This show doesn't deserve 5 stars but as many as humanly possible \nand i have know idea why this was never a dicks pick are you kidding me!",

He carries the show with his rendition of \"Turn On Your Lovelight\".\n\nThe GRATEFUL DEAD perform some of our favorite songs from 1969 all for a $3.00 admission fee.\nI think the \"Bitter Seeds\" opened the show.

I was 14-15, I remember it.\n\nElvis was King, Nixon was President and there was nothing like a GRATEFUL DEAD concert. \n\nThe equipment crew for the GRATEFUL DEAD always busted their a$$es to set up the amps, and equipment.  Without those folks there would be no show. \n\nI want to thank those guys and gals behind the scenes that did everything it took to put the GRATEFUL DEAD on stage for the fans. \n\nBack in 1969 there were no \"huge production companies\" with all the equipment you could \"rent\" to put on a show. The GRATEFUL DEAD practically invented the concept of \"big\" live shows with \"great sound\". \n\nWho knew hippies and freaks were such militaristic capitalists? \n\nWell, it is called \"Show Business\", NO Business, NO Show.\n\nThank you Bill Graham for being the protaganist for the GRATEFUL DEAD. We miss you.\n\nEven way back in 1969 the GRATEFUL DEAD were a force to be reckoned with. \n\nI highly recommend adding this Monterey, California show to your 1969 GRATEFUL DEAD collection. \n\nFive stars for the mix, recording, performance & transfer.\n\nAs with all shows on the Internet Archive I highly recommend you use your EQ during playback.\n\nHere's one way to download this show:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer.

The sound quality of the recording is average, but the music is supercharged and nearly manic at times. This last screwball who rated this show doesn't know what he's talking about. The songs are out of order- check with older reviews if you care to get things in the right order, but they are all from this date. They're electric and tight. If the sound quality were good, it'd have been a Dick's pick long ago. I've been a deadhead for 30 years and though i've worn this out listening to it too much, it still is a top notch favorite. The eleven is dizzying and almost impossible to follow, if you listen to Jerry. He'll take you all over the place and make the beat very difficult to maintain.",

But Dark Star is sweet, oh so sweet as well.\n\nDoes anyone know who it is who sings the first chorus of the last go at Lovelight? (just about 20 seconds after the end of Drums). It doesn't sound like Bob to me.",

Pretyy amazing sound for a show that happened 50 years ago.  Also, they evidently had hocked Tom's B3 throughout this stretch, which is a real shame.  Sounds like the backup keyboard, a Vox I think.   Also pretty thoroughly amazing that a one-of-a kind band, incredibly talented, and popular band like these were having trouble making ends meet.  \n\nBut, the Bob, Jerry, and Phil mix is just fine and they are all totally on fire.  The Dark Star-->St. Stephen-->Eleven suite is absolutely stunning and crackling with original jamming.  Don't miss this one.",

      "review_text": "A Grateful Treat in the Monterey Summer No, there's no \"Performing Arts Center\"....this gig was at MPC (Monterey Peninsula College).  And it was a beauty. Bar none, the *best* Eleven I ever saw & heard: Garcia as intensely focused as I've ever seen him, driving his arpeggios with hypersonic force...he was kicking the rest of the band into a different dimension, and was not letting up for a nanosecond.  The whole band was working to keep up, and fell into a fiery groove, holding the centrifugal force of an aural hurricane.  And it was also the gig I will always remember as my favorite Pigpen moment: he was at his peak, and his style was still fully integrated into the band's persona, before the diminution of the straight blues numbers.  All in all, a great summer evening before heading back to Big Sur....",
