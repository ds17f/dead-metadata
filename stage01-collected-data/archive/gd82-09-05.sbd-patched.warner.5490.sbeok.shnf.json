(Phil) Well, I'm revising this slightly, because the last fellow's claim that there were only ~ \"50\" people there is a gigantic approximation. And approximation is what I mean by \"~\". Since I was one of those ~ \"50\" and can still pictue it mentally in color I should know. Yes, it is true at 9:30 A.M. there were far less than the eventual ~150,000 people, but certainly alot more than 50 !\n     Sort of short, yet longer than most if not all the other acts. I saw all 3 days of the US Festival and they were still one of the best.\n     Given the ~105\u00c2\u00b0(F) heat, they played well, (Despite some MDA, unusual for me), I thought it is good but certainly not one of the best I've attended, especially at the beginning ie. Playin' in the Band -> Minglwood Blues - > Shakedown Street !",

Got up early, and drove to the show with my two buddies, both named robert.  all we brought with us was a big bag of nacho cheese doritos, a can of cheese whiz and a gram of coke.  needless to say, not a good combination--it was only like 108 degrees that day in the shade, which by the way didnt exist.  the day started out okay before it got too hot, the dead rocked-especially the Satisfaction encore!  but as the day progressed with the coke, the cheese whiz and the ruthless sun-what a colossal headache! jerry jeff walker, jimmy buffett, jackson browne not withstanding,  we left during fleetwood mac.  i dont know if i coulda stuck it out in the dust, mud and sun all weekend-like my buddy phil did below.  it was fun, but not so fun that my head didnt feel like it would explode if we stayed any longer.",

They sound like they got a good nights rest and were ready to crank it out at 9:00 AM.  \n\nPlayin->Shakedown is wonderful.  Jerry melts into Shakedown out of Playin a little too quick for me (they were just getting loosened up during the playin jam) but a noteworthy Shakedown makes up for the quick transition.\n\nMinglewood is typically hot for this time period and the China/Rider matches up with 8/7 and 8/10. Was '82 the best year for the China/Rider transition or what?  the ONLY issue here is that Rider cuts out a little early, but it's close to the end of the song anyway.  Just be warned cause I was bummed the first time I was listening and it got cut. \n\nI put this one on my MP3 player and went for a jog and ended up leaving it on there for the next three jogs.

The reason Phil said that is because there were less than 50 of us spread out near the stage, on a couple dozen blankets, eating yogurt, bananas and granola. It was like being at a private Grateful Dead Party. Sure, up on the hill, there were 50,000 zonked out people who had partied till 2 and 4 am for the last two nights, and thought what the hell is this at 9:00 am. The Dead were only added to the line-up 2 weeks before the dates, when Bill Graham was brought on to take care of the mess the production had become from that Apple computer guy. Sure it was hot, but at 9:00 am, it was only about 85, and by the end of the set, about 400 dancing fans were grooving around the stage. And they would spray us with water when it got hot. My favorite concert ever! And for the rest of the day, I found they had a cold pool in the Beer Garden, with a nice ledge to sit your beer on, and a set of speakers set up so the center of the pool was the sweet spot.  It was 115 degrees and the pool was clean and fresh with no chemicals because a giant water main pipe gushed fresh water into it to keep it clean. I listened to the rest of the groups in hi-fidelity right there.  It was Heaven!",

      "review_text": "Short but sweet First of all, this is quite obviously an amazing setlist. I mean... first-set PITB... that transitions into a Shakedown?!? Pretty awesome stuff, if you ask me. Not only is the setlist great, but the songs are very well-played. The first set is more exciting and \"out-there\" than many second sets I've heard, starting with an opening sequence that sounds just as phenominal as it looks on paper and ending with one of the best China Cat/Riders I've heard from the Brent era... if not THE best. The fun continues with the second set, which also contains some really strong playing. Other than PITB -> Shakedown -> Minglewood, I wouldn't say that there's all that much \"jamming out\" here, but that doesn't detract much from the show. This is really powerful and energetic stuff, as is a lot of stuff I've heard from '82. Think '71, except with Brent instead of Pigpen.\n\nOverall, I recommend this to anyone interested in Brent-erea stuff. If you like this, you also might want to check out the performance the band did in Jamaica later this year, which is another example of the band showing up at a festival and kicking serious butt.",

During Shakedown Brents' piano is wildly distorted as is quite painful to listen to while wearing headphones. I outta know I listened to this at work and it's a shame because the band are playing well. The mix is a bit wonky at times: Phil's there, then he's not, etc. By Minglewood tho, things have settled down and the show gets into gear. There's nothing all that special and nothing bad either, it's a good solid show held early in the morning  on a really hot day.",
