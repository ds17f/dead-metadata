The Jack opener may be my favorite version of all time. Brent struts his stuff on a very cool Far From Me, and Bobby dedicates Samson to a crumbling Garden (the old building wouldn't be torn down for another 11 years). The Uncle John's>Playing is unique.

Thats when I kneeeeeewwww it was going to be a cool night.\n\nWent to the show got dosed and came back looking for the party afterwards but could never connect with anyone unfortunately did leave a nice note for Jerry et al the next day saying how much I enjoyed the show. Cassidy, red rooster and West LA from set I(one of the first times they played this) stood out to me and listening to stuff bouncing off the rafters which Bobby kept point to during 'tear this old building down' in sampson - not sure they liked playing this all that much as this did not play here again for another 9 years almost to the day....Lived in Boston over 5 years in the 80's and never came across this tape so thank you! The stellar shows from this tour were UVA, the first night of the Garden, and Portland which they had just played the night before and clearly drained Jerry. Fun nonetheless and nothing could have stolen my excitement to be there....",

      "review_text": "Not a bad beginning First show for me. Not a bad slice of fall 82. Nice soundboard despite being a little Phil-lite in parts. First set had a nice Sugaree with a mellow jam more akin to 80's FOTD, West LA was high point for me then and now. Uncle John>Playin' is well excecuted if rather jam free. Early Throwing Stones without the 'ashes ashes' ending still seem odd to me, in fact all these years I thought Providence spring 83 was the first I'd heard of this song, but it was merely the first time with the fleshed out ending.\nJerry's sincere reading of Baby Blue is worth a listen.In a year of few sbds it's worth a download.",

We got into the show a couple of moments late, just as Bob sang, \"we used to play for silver, now we play for life.\"  The first lines I heard the Dead sing in concert seemed like deep wisdom to my 19-year old ears, as they had to my 16-year old ears on \"Europe 72\" and as they do still do, for that matter.  \n\nI recall the general puzzlement that greeted \"Throwin' stones,\" which was then brand new.  I also vividly remember the vehemence with which Bob and the boys belted out \"If I had my way, I'd tear this old building down,\" with the crowd chanting and stomping so strongly that it almost seemed that the creaky old Boston Garden might actually simply give way and fall down!\n\nAfter the show, my girlfriend (now wife!) and I walked around looking for the girl we had come to the show with, and I was singing over and over the encore's refrain, \"it's all over now baby blue.\"  As we were walking and looking, we were thinking about a name for the tiny little kitten we had gotten that morning.  It was in that moment that she was dubbed \"Baby Blue,\" a name she proudly carried for the rest of her wonderful, beloved life.",

I saw the entire East Coast Fall 1982 Tour.\nThis show is overlooked as the classic Portland show the night before is the real gem as were the MSG shows that followed. This was pretty good though. This SBD doesn't convey anything. I think the SBDs of this era are atrocious - too thin, no ambient sound, drums sound like toys etc. ANYWAY...\n*** I first received a cassette of 09/17 only a few days after the show. It was a 1st GEN from Cohen. Filler on it was the Baby Blue encore from this show - I never specifically asked if Mark taped it, but always assumed he did.\nIt had a very similar sound as 09/17 despite being a different venue.\nI assume there is a Cohen AUD floating out there somewhere. Hard to believe there are 3&4 sources of other shows and not a single AUD source to be had for this one.\nI don't recall, but maybe the Boston security was a hassle for tapers. \nI really hope an AUD surfaces for this Golden Tour.

My name is Brent and at that show I was 15 and did not know any band members by name.

I think I got off to a great start from here in my Hometown. The scene was North Station/Boston Garden. Major vending,a sea of mostly red 5lb NO2 balloons,weak police presence,hippies skipping,people swaying,thick anticipation,the huge Budweiser billboard on the Garden roof brillently turned into a magical Grateful Dead sign by DeadHeads that was seen from across the bay!

Then scratching our heads in puzzlement when, after Far From Me, instead of an anticipated set-closer from Jerry (Deal, Don't Ease, something), Garcia stepped to the mic and said they'd be back after a short break - this was Bob's job, of course, and anyway it was clearly one tune too soon, so we wondered what was up with that... The Samson that opened Set II and generally ferocious vibe the rest of the way hinted at some sort of strife or anger (and fueled what I remember as a pretty hot set), but we heard no explanation via the grapevine... Then they didn't play the Garden for almost a decade (grumble grumble), and when they finally did (for a memorable six-show run in '91 that culminated on 9/26/91, a show noteworthy for an epic-for-its-era, Dark Star, the final We Bid You Goodnight, etc.), there it was in the newspaper articles heralding the return - members of the crew evidently had been busted grilling lobsters on a fire escape during this show in '82, and so for years The Dead refused to come back, and instead we trekked to Worcester or Providence or (ugh) Foxboro...

I remember sitting on one of the benches in the general transit lobby of the Garden, pre-show, very much \"detached\", one might say. A girl sat down next to (she was not going to the show; just passing through on her daily commute as an art-school student). She asked if she could use a permanent marker and draw on my deeply faded, pale sky-blue jeans. I said, \"Sure\". She drew an amazing collage of intertwined images (Yes, I verified later that this was not simply my subjective evaluation at the point in time it was happening). The drawing remained for the several years I wore those jean afterward. I wish I knew where they are now! Oh, the show? Yet another proverbial potato chip of which one could never get enough...(I save 5 stars for those many shows that are primarily clustered in the '72-ish time period).",

I did not really know what to expect and had never seen anything like this wild scene. \n\nBefore the show I was waiting in front to meet my friends and this truck pulls up and they open the back and there are hundreds and hundreds of red roses in it. They hand them out in bunches to people. A beautiful young lady grabs a bunch and hands me one and then she walks over to this police officer standing on the corner. He's a heavyset middle aged guy that is looking all serious. She hands him a rose and he takes it and bites on the middle of the stem so he is holding it with his teeth. We all loved his spirit and it really epitomized the type of experience that was a dead show.\n\nOur seats were on the side of the stage and the sound was not great but we had a good view of the band. Especially the drums. I was blown away by the drum solo. So many percussion instruments all in the same place. A few years later I picked up mallet percussion and have played ever since.\n\nI remember Bobby was bouncing all over the place. At one point he jumped up on a monitor/speaker cab on the side of the stage and was performing specifically to the folks on our side of the stage. The Samson and Delilah was especially energized and after singing \"If I had my way, I would tear this old building down\" he adds \"and it needs it\". Very appropriate. The place stood for another 15 years but finally they did tear it down.\n\nI saw a bunch of other shows at the \"Gahden\", including some with Hornsby that were totally killing, but this show will always hold a special place in my heart.",

I was a freshman at Harvard and most of my new college friends were already fans.  An upperclassman booked a a privately run bus to bring about 50 Harvard students to this show.  I think the tickets cost about $25 and the bus fare was maybe $40.  The bus was an ancient school bus about 50 years old and had a very cool psychedelic paint job which spelled out \"Magic Bus\" in giant bubble letters.  I was a Navy ROTC student and had to get back to campus from MIT which is a few miles down Massachusetts Ave, and I was running late.  I arrived at the Magic Bus in my Service Dress Blue uniform and they wouldn't let me aboard.  Hah!  They very thoughtfully held the bus until I could change into something more reasonable.  And then off we went to the Garden where this magical show happened.  As they were wrapping up a fantastic version of Uncle John's Band, I shouted out, really loudly, - \"Is Uncle John still Playin' in the Band?\", much to the chagrin of my friends.  \"Shut-up, man!  They don't take requests\".  Jerry stopped in his tracks, lit a cigarette, turned around, nodded over to Bob, who was on the other side of the stage, and they went straight into Playin'.",
