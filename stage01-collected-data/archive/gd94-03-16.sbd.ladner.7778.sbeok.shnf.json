Some decent moments (\"High Time\" stands out, solid \"Scarlet>Fire\"), some classic '94 clunkers (was \"Easy Answers\" the lamest GD song ever? Top 5, anyway). Worth having for the memories if you were there, you might listen to it more than once.",

      "review_text": "Very Solid Show I was at this show as well and it was one of my favorites.  The first set had plenty of highlights with nice song selections--Jack Straw, SMR, High Time, BIODTL...granted, the set did end a bit flat with the Easy Answers>Don't East given its high ceiling earlier.  Second set was outstanding with a scorching Scarlet>Fire (incidentally, Phil admitted to having a spiritual experience during the segue jam of this version in a later interview).  LL Rain was beautiful as well. There was a banner being held up during the show (around the 20th row on Jer's side) that read: \"Last Chicago Dark Star...('such and such year')\". The boys granted Chicago the favor of busting out the second to last Dark Star ever. A short version but a treat nonetheless.  The jam out of space heavily hints to being a second Dark Star verse before melting into a Truckin groove which ultimately resonated in Miracle.  I'm giving it five stars on song selection, sound quality and personal aesthetics. It's better than the three-star rating, imo.",

      "review_text": "Anybody else notice... ...how nasal'y Jerry voice was in 94 (mainly Spring 94)? It's like he had a head cold the whole tour. Good Sounding recording with a pretty darn nice performance. Jerry starts out the Jack Straw with a litany of sour notes, only to turn the whole thing around for pretty much the whole rest of the show. A 4- in my book. \n\nThis was John Cutler's first show as Soundman.\n\nGreat Dark Star. The first one in twenty years for Chicago with lyrics (6-22-91 was an instrumental version). Last Chi-town Dark Star before this one: 7-25-74 International Amphitheatre.\n\nThat annoying static during Minglewood and SMR is not an artifact of the recording, but was actually audible during the show.",

      "review_text": "Yea, I did notice Jerrys kind of nasaly head cold vocals.. The funny thing about your review was I was just listening to ohio 94 with that nice Peggy  Speedway,He's gone and last but not least that sweet Stella Blue. During the Peggy O. I was thinking about mentioning that nasal vocal sound then decided screw it and wanted to browse the Rosemont shows only because I attended and I read your comment. Grate minds think alike I guess, anyway my opinion is 2 fold Jerry's been doing a little H. via nose and their sound system changed for the worse. It's kind of computer sounding I think it started literally with the first Vince show that I also attended little bit of a bore other than being at a Dead show. New Key boarder new sound I remember really noticing this in 92 when trading tapes like the Feb. 0akland shows and Cal Expo etc. and witnessing it live in soldier Field and mentioning the sound with friends that it was getting lame. 1991 esp. with Bruce better shows than previous year for sure then it got worse as time went on to the point of not being able to here Jerry sing and seeing him frusted. There were times at various shows that I didn't feel like it was a live show even though they were playin in front of me. I like to find some moments of total brillance in the early to mid 90's in the way Jerry emphasizes some words or slick solo's but as far as whole shows it was over they day Brent Died. Make no mistake I went the shows until the very end but, I found myself laughing alot with some of my buddies during some of the stuff the were up to. ie:during this show for ex.way to go home,easy answers-horrible,and Fought The Law. (not played here equally as bad Corina,eternity and rain.)  \n  As far as this show goes  I like to see Jerry do So many Roads smokinn solo and I stoked when I heard the opening notes to High Time long favorite of mine. Althogh again this one compared to some of the 70's and 80's it pales in comparision take what you can get at the time and Scarlet>Fire was pretty good. On a positive for new material I really like So Many Roads,Days Between and enjoyed Liberty but not in high rotation. Kind of a weak run but, good sound here. Back to 83,84,85 and 89 spring and summer 90.",

      "review_text": "On third thought - EXCELLENT My first impression of this show while browsing shows was Wow - powerhouse show!\nMy 2nd impression while sampling the songs was that the performance was lackluster in certain key places - FOTD and Scarlet for example - stuck me as 'going thru the motions' - and these are two bellwether Dead songs IMO. I want to hear that bounce in Scarlet, and conversely, I want to feel the lazy wandering of FOTD w/o much drums.\nMy 3rd impression after several listens - is that this IS a very strong show like I originally thought it might be. EXCELLENT aggressive, powerful sound. A little more dirt from Bobby's guitar than usual. Some songs that start out unimpressively really catch on and turn out great overall\n\nSound Quality = 4.5\nPerformance = 3.75-4-ish\nSong Selection = 4.5",

OK, I've seen 100 Dead/Jerry/Ratdog,etc shows and thanks to my main touring buddy this was the only show to ever sit front row dead center (seats 27 & 28).  He got the tix thru mail-order and yes indeed the band rewarded us old stallwarts.  \nI can remember Jerry melting in front of me during Dark Star.  Jerry's use of the MIDI was the highlight and to watch the band interplay made me think these guys still had somehing to offer.  Scarlet>Fire was also very well played as was some 1st set offerings (FOTD, High Time and Easy Answer).  To watch Bobby spray half of his lyrics is something to see.  I now know why many fans wore raingear when they sat front row.  I would like to also thank GDTS as well as my buddy Curly.  THANKS!",

I always thought Jer gave it a little extra on IFTL and it showed the Boys could laugh at themselves.  The cops were pretty stern at this show so the IFTL added some levity to the experience.

      "review_text": "Sp94 Rosemont- Night 1 I'm with doug the dude on this show. High energy first set that, yes, does seem to fizzle out some by the end. Jack Straw opener is a little rough going for Jerry to start, but it surprises as he gets his grounding. All told, this show is a powerhouse and is easily one of the best shows of the year. So Many Roads always makes for a late-era dead highlight and this one is no exception. It\u2019s got a little skip to it, played at a bit of a faster tempo. Some lyrical stumbling, but it's a beauty as always. Garcia sounds great on the Tom Thumb\u2019s that follows with a sweet solo. High Time also nestled in that first set, would only play three more High Times- on 7/20, 10/11 and 3/24/95.\n\nSecond set is great. Scarlet-Fire opener is always a treat. The Fire's better than the Scarlet but it's all good, especially for 94. Definite highlight, though, is the Dark Star. Last played 21 shows prior on 9/22/93. This would be the penultimate version, the final version coming a couple weeks later on 3/30. The whole 25 minutes of Drums/Space feels like an extension of the song, with the last couple minutes before I Need a Miracle teasing the Dark Star. Great stuff. Really nice SOTM - with some lyrical flubs - out of INAM in the closing ballad slot.",
