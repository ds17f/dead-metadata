This portion was remastered by GDH host David Gans and sounds spectacular!  The feel in the early portion of Dark Star is similar to the great jam before Wharf Rat in the 7/27/73 soundcheck just five days earlier, and the energy is just great throughout.  Also, the mix seems to be switched, as if you're sitting at Billy's drums with Jerry and the ride cymbal to the right and Bobby, Keith, and the hi-hat on the left... which is great for air drumming while driving (not the stop-n-go sort)... not that I condone that sort of thing.  =)",

But the Dark Star is fantastic and unique.  The part I play over and over is the pre-verse jam, roughly minutes 3 - 12 of this Star.  At lightning speed, ideas emerge and themes unfold.  Out of this full-band dynamic an awesome groove develops, at once uncontrolled chaos and tight funky jam.  Brilliant.  \n\nBill's drums are louder than normal in the mix, a nice change in sound not heard on too many tapes.  If you dig unique Dead music, this Dark Star is a must-hear.",

People say that the Eyes is \"unfocused\", well i like this one a lot because it is quite different than other Eyes. Jerry takes off like a mad man, and Bobby really compliments him well here. The ending is pure Jerry soul as he steals my face. Morning Dew is the perfect way to end, and the climax just seems to never come. amazing. sound is pretty good too.",

I don't know what was going on in and around the band at this specific time but  the emergence of this nights configuration indicates a unique creative force had been folling them around. (check out Watkins Glenn 7-14-73).   Definatly cool stuff here friends.  Dark star is pulsating with steller energy.  A cosmic blessing from the universe to celebrate Jerry's birthday? Maybe.  The Eyes is upbeat and and the melody is sweet except for a few little strange turns of the guitar after the first chorus but by this time youve probably already been turned inside out and are floating off the ground anyway sound just enjoy the muse.   It still gives me goosebumps.",

      "review_text": "Good Recoding strategy The most notable thing here, besides the playing and fun had at the show, is how well this sounds - it seemingly has that desired mix of mostly board, but with enough audience that it feels more like being there than most shows provide.  Neither plastic (sign of too much board) nor distant (sign of weak audience tracks), we are transformed/transported well into the night's festivities.  \n\nA plus from this era - it is always special to see/hear Jerry as lead on four of five consecutive tunes (ROW>DARK STAR>el paso>EYES>DEW), which genuinely notes/archives how deeply Jerry would get in a groove that no one (especially the other members) wanted to end, and he delivered accordingly.  And, further more, this only goes to prove why this band should have stayed silent after his passing, for, as Pete Townsend commented about bringing in 17 instruments when they performed TOMMY and QUADROPHENIA, \"Look what we had to do to replace Keith Moon\" - no reorganization or replacement effort can supply the artistic/beauty levels Jerry brought to the table.  Jerry was already (born) at the artistic level most of the other members sought (why they followed his \"lead\" in more ways than just onstage), and only Mickey has (independently) reached close to such levels since.",

      "review_text": "One Of The Best Dark Stars Ever This has always been one of my favorite shows. I have had parts of it since the late 70's. For a long time, I only had the Dark Star>El Paso>Eyes >Dew, and am so happy to be able to get the whole show now. To me this is one of the great Dark Stars of all time. The jam after the verse is spacy and sweet, and the transition into El Paso is very smooth, and actually works very well. The Eyes is one of those classic 20 minute '73 versions with the Stronger than Dirt jam at the end, and the Dew is one of the slowest I have heard. The rest of the show really rocks as well. The Sound is excellent!! \n\n As an aside, the dark Star>El Paso jam is one that we would often play in the hotel after shows as everyone was getting ready for bed and trying to crash out. This was not because it is a boring jam, it is definitely not that, but the jam after the verse and into El Paso is long and very spacey and is a perfect jam to get your mind to stop racing and relax, it worked every time!!\n Get this show!!",

So far this is every bit as good as I remembered it to be. Does anybody have this on cd that I can get a copy of? I'll send blanks in return. For some reason, I can't download this show on to my computer. The Band was great on this night too even though they hadn't played much that year.",

      "review_text": "Fantastic 73 Power This show just goes to show the commitment of every member of this group to creating beautiful, mind-bending, utterly amazing music, despite the death of one of the band's core members a few months prior.  Miles2184 makes a great point about Jerry's supernatural musical gifts, but this show proves how much the rest of the band cannot be downplayed.  Bob Weir, while a protege of Jerry, was integral to the Grateful Dead, just as Jerry was.  If Bob had passed first, I know Jerry would have continued, and I personally view it as a tribute to Jerry that the rest of the members of the Grateful Dead continue to bring this amazing music to young, inspired minds everywhere.",

For those of you who rate it highly, you nailed it and Im amazed that that you were able to from the quality of these tapes. Some memories: at the end of Casey Jones for the cresendo, the roadcrew released about a dozen fire estinguishers that sent a slow rolling clous of co2 over the crowed and air conditioned the stadium on a ver hot night. Then during the break little 3x5 pieces of paper were sent throught the crowd (alledegedly from the road crew and alledgedly Owsleys finest ) with the verbal instructions to \"rip off a piece you thin you can handle\" . All I can say is that by the time intermission was over my friends and I were in orbit on the cleanest trip I ever had.  Then the second set opened up and fireworks were set off behind the stage and Happy Birthday Jerry fireworks were lit off around the upper deck of the stadium. Jerry's birthday party was on and thats what you all hear in this music.  A VERY special show indeed, I just wish you all could have been there.",

You must get last night's show here:\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd73-07-31.aud.weiner.gdADT12.12883.sbeok.shnf\n\nRoosevelt Stadium was the smokin' follow-up to the June 9 & 10 shows at RFK Stadium, in Wash D.C. Watkins Glen was way too many people for me to enjoy it, but I went there with my friends. I saw many of the other east coast shows in '73, up north, like Nassau Colliseum and the Spectrum. RFK Stadium had the best \"sound\" I ever heard -- hands down. The Dead played great there. It was the sound system that nailed it. Best sound that I EVER heard coming out of a PA System, period! Perfect. Roosevelt Stadium came in 2nd for me because these 2 shows are very exciting. The sound has tinny moments. Definitely very special. Definitely history. The best of the Wall of Sound era.\n\nRFK Stadium Sat & Sun shows, June 9 & 10, 1973:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd73-06-09.sbd.hollister.174.sbeok.shnf\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd73-06-10.sbd.hollister.174.sbeok.shnf",

I was shocked by the size of the crowd.  I had been over seas and had not seen the Dead since 1971 Filmore and Port Chester shows.  I was bummed that I was way back behind a huge crowd.  Still, I the show is really well played and I have come to love 73 though not as much as 69-71!  I took a big hiatus after feeling so lost in Roosevelt Stadium and Didn't see the dead until 80 or 81.  My loss.  but here on the Archive everthing becomes possible!

Finally, one of the intruiges of this show is the completely unorthodox set list. Stella Blue->Big River? Dark Star->El Paso?",
