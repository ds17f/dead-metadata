The Stella Blue compares well to live performances, and has the advantage of studio-quality mixing and vocals, but is not over-produced. The Weather Report Suite sparkles, and Mississippi and Row Jimmy are classic '70s Jerry. Eyes is way too short, but  we do get some intricate ensemble playing. (Sing Your Blues Away is the weak spot.)\n\nThis collection of outtakes is not only historically interesting, but has some very good performances. The two Stellas and the Here Comes Sunshine are as complete and as good as the album versions. Also a great Weather Report Suite. We also get some Jerry solos not found on the album.\n\nBut don't be satisfied with this download. No studio Dead collection is complete without Wake of the Flood.",

      "review_text": "Archiveological Find! WOTF (not to be confused with \"wtf\" of irc shorthand fame) is easily my favorite studio release. Three years after the release of American Beauty, and free from the constraints of a Warner Bros contract, WOTF drips with blues (smiley face blues and the wretched angst variety, all on one LP!), reggae, jazz, bluegrass, and maybe even a smattering of funkadelic. Some of Hunter's best lyrical efforts as well, imo. Barlow didn't fare so badly either!\n\nThat makes these outtakes that much more intriguing. The sound quality is brill... someone mentioned the angelic quality of Donna's voice. Stella Blue's vocal harmonies certainly support that notion.\n\n1973 was smack dab in the middle of the evolution/diversification of \"60's rock\" into the many flavors of the 70's. Psychedelia was waning, evolving into new interpretations of american roots music. The variety of musical styles that emerged/blossomed/matured during that decade boggles the mind (classic rock, funkadelia, reggae, country rock, blues/jazz fusion, punk, disco, new wave, \"old and in the way\", and heavy metal comprise but a partial listing). \n\nCompare that musically diverse decade to the now 16-year-rut that \"rock\" finds itself in (rap/hip-hop or pop diva/boy band - hey, it's YOUR choice people!) I got slightly alarmed the other day realizing that some of the old Carpenters and BeeGees songs were better than the current crap. When is the last time something truly unique made the playlist of any cookie-cutter \"rock\" station? Sure, we've had folks like Dave Matthews managing to crack playlists (even he admits he had to write more \"accessible\" songs in order to reach radio audiences).\n\nThere may never be another era in which one could enjoy the likes of the Grateful Dead, Floyd, the Talking Heads, Jeff Beck, Bob Marley, King Crimson, Bowie, Eno, NRPS, Little Feat, Poco, Gentle Giant, CSN & (sometimes) Y, etc. in an afternoon on the FM band.\n\nThanks for this nugget from that era.",

      "review_text": "Mighty Fine WOTF would be the studio effort that best personifies the band from this date forward. Workingmans and American Beauty serve up some delicious tracks, but fall short of showing the artistic range of this album. Both sets of writing partners are at their peak. Stella Blue from Garcia/Hunter and WRS from Weir/Barlow show a significant maturity in both style and substance over their previous work. Even Eyes, although way too brief, lays a superb improvisational foundation for live play. Future offerings lack Garcia's stunning and emotional pedal steel work...and it's unfortunate that he rarely broke it out live with the Dead. These outtakes alos provide interesting insight into the building of a song when played bak-to-back with the released version.",

      "review_text": "\"...Putting In 289 Working Hours...\" \"...at the Record Plant in Sausalito (Calif).\"\n\nObviously, since the GD played at Roosevelt on this date, this date is in error, but the month and year are correct, of course. Here is Grateful Dead Historian Dennis McNally's quote from page 458 A Long Strange Trip:\n\n\"Back home, the Dead returned to the studio for the first time in three years, putting in 289 working hours at the Record Plant in Sausalito to create Wake of the Flood.\"\n\nI definitely recall they were in Studio A, and Studio A cost $100 an hour in 1973. The tab from the Record Plant would have been $289,000 but the GD got a bit of a break by hiring the studio during off hours in what is termed in the recording industry, a \"lock out.\"\n\nStill, they paid the Plant over 200 grand for this recording, which is more than a million in today's dollars.\n\nLooking back. It was a deal. Initially, this album sold 400,000 copies, and eventually went platinum... after 35 years.\n\nNow, that's longevity!\n\nIn the history of music there has never been a musical act that has recorded as many of their concerts, rehearsals and recording sessions.\n\nWhich lends one's self to declare that there has never been anything like the Grateful Dead and there might never be.\n\nBut dutiful and beautiful souls have determined to  preserve this music and they have found the Archives.org to act as the depository.\n\nThank you to all involved.\n\nTime to make a small donation.\n\nOh, yeah, this set of studio outtakes is choice stuff. Enjoy.",

      "review_text": "Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world... This is a great sounding studio recording by Betty Cantor that really shines capturing a defining period in the band's continuing exploration and evolution. Wake of the Flood incorporated many of the jazz qualities that influenced the Dead from the likes of Coltrane, Miles etc. This material - Eyes of the World, Here Comes Sunshine etc. continued to be part of the band's repertoire on the road until Jerry's death, and allowed them the opportunity to experiment and step-out into many delightful extended jamming moments. For those who love this period and material, give a listen to the exquisite version of Here Comes Sunshine on 12-19-73 at Tampa, FL. also available on Dick's Picks Vol 1. Also, for a beautifully haunting version of Eyes, don't overlook the 3-29-90 show at the Nassau Coliseum with Brandford Marsalis accompanying the Dead on saxaphone, which can be found on Dozin At the Knick CD. You'll love it!",

Also, I have always been of the opinion that the Grateful Dead studio lps in the 70s (early to mid seventies) were as good as any rock group during that period. The Grateful Dead made their reputation on the road as a live act,( and I dont think there is a dispute as to who the best live act was) and that is where they were best, but that makes it so easy to dismiss thier studio output. To do so would be a mistake. Wake of the Flood and Mars hotel have become two lps that I find myself listening more and more. I know there is nothing better than live Dead, but lets not forget their studio lps either",
