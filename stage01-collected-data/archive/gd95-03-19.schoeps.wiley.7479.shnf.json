Thanks for uploading this aud, everyone.  This is a show that should definitely be enjoyed with the audience reaction to UBC over the soundboard anyway.  \n\nThis run of shows was the last time I saw the Dead in my hometown of Philadelphia, so there are some real vivid memories of the experience for me.  \n\nI'll never forget the first set, after the band broke into Don't Ease as the fifth song played, thinking \"WTF, five song first set?  What is going on?\"  Then out of nowhere, the entire place is floored by the completely unexpected breakout of Unbroken Chain.  I remember for years in venues all over the country, deadheads linking together the thin, flexible glowsticks in the upper level, and people saying if they ever got it to completely encircle the venue that the band would play Unbroken Chain.  Well, they played it anyway...\n\nIf you read the reviews for the soundboard version, you'll get a general idea of the quality of this show.  Most if not everyone will d/l for the historic element of the first UBC ever.  They'll get a rousing Alabama Getaway and an above average version of So Many Roads as well in the first set, and a pretty lackluster second set.  For those that complain about the quality of 94-95 shows, all I can say is I would give almost anything to see Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead perform a 1995 calibre show again.  In retrospect, I certainly wish I had seen more of them while they were still performing, \"bad shows\" and all.\n\nAs for this particular recording, it is pretty good.  A little hollow sounding, and I wish the vocals were more up front, but not much to be done about that.  The first second or two of Alabama is clipped.  Thanks again to everyone involved for making this show available for download once again.",

I was secretly hoping Jerry would somehow recover and come back strong, a la 87, but he just looked about 90 years old by the Summer.  \n\nI will argue this point: the debut of the Unbroken Chain makes this not near to being one of the worst shows.  I believe that distinction should go to the las Giants Stadium show... check out the Wharf Rat and you'll see what I mean.  Still, one of the first reviewers made a good point: I'd really love to see a \"bad\" Dead show nowadays, because even a bad one could still be fun.  Sigh.",

'cause I saw them, heard them so many times... and now... I'd give anything just to be back in the room with Jerry on his worst night playing even the most over played songs.\n\ni guess, because i did go on to a career and even opening my own software business and had to sacrifice the last few years of shows, that i'm a little bit bitter when i read some of these reviews.  i don't mind so much when people are critical of technical aspects of the performance, 'cause, c'mon, i was there, too... but to call the crowd \"sad\" for cheering the boys when they took the stage... man, get a life and find a woman and learn how to love and be loved... because you obviously have some issues to resolve.  the only thing \"sad\"... is that Jerry isn't at the party any more and it just ain't the same without him.\n\nand yeah... i was at this show.  and eternally grateful for this one and every one.  thank you, Jerry!",

What a short-sighted hypocrite you are!\n\nYes Skuzzlebutt's review is pretty pointy and he's hard on the audience but I have noticed that he and a number of other certain frequent reviewers are known for being brutally frank in their dislike of the mid-90s Dead sound and the scene in general. The criticism that the Dead audience was ruled over by an \"uncritical majority\" is nothing new and has been commented on by numerous people both inside and outside the GD organization. This shouldnb't be new or suprising news to you.

What will you tell people who never got the opportunity to see the Grateful Dead? How will you spread the spiritual energy that Jerry freely offered for so many years?\nAs a great author once wrote - \"The Critic\" who stands on the sideline is the true loser, for he/she will never know the feeling of winning or losing, and the greatness it takes to pick oneself, skinned knees and continue to struggle onward to the finish. \nJerry picked himself up so many times and in his own way carried us all thriugh ,amy tough times. How many of you put an old tape into the deck and let his playing ease your own souls. It is up to us now to shed light and not to master.Time to join the heart of gold band.

I had seats way, way, way up in the rafters for this one, and yes, the show wasn't all that great, but it was a Dead show none-the-less, and Phil was finally able to play his \"baby\" live.\nAnyway, for the folks (such as myself and others) that were fortunate enough to attend a great number of Dead shows (and Jerry shows, for that matter)over the years will all probably agree upon this one point- after 89', you pretty much went to a show not expecting a \"whole\" hell of a lot.  That is, the \"whole\" show itself was not anything to write home about, but there was always something, somewhere during a set that left a smile on your face as you were strolling back to the parking lot, and that time, it was \"Unbroken Chain.\"\nFor example, the previous night (3/18) the \"Visions of Johanna\" they played was the most incredible thing I had seen them do in years... still smiling about that one.  Another one that I remember very, very well was the opener at Shoreline (7/2/94) Music> Sugaree> Music... another \"grinner.\"  \nThe point is, Jerry's gone, The Dead's gone, JGB's gone, and we should all be thankful that we got the opportunity to see them play, even if it wasn't \"all that great\" because we will never be able to again.",

You can critique the balls off of any given show (whether you're responding to the show itself, or just being contrary), but the final truth is that sound quality and even musical quality doesn't always paint the whole picture. \n\nYes, I prefer by a wide margin 69-77 to nearly everything after, but this show moves me. Period. \n\nThat makes it a five-star show in my book.",

      "review_text": "Poor show! Quite a lackluster show. But people will say: \"they broke out Unbroken Chain\"! Too bad it was years too late and Garcia couldn't hack playing the song, especially the solo section. When I saw Unbroken Chain I was embarrassed for the band and Jerry inparticular. It didn't make the show I saw any better. \n\nOne of the previous reviewers is right about the 2nd set song selection, especially before drums. It was bad enough they could barely play as a group competently anymore, but all these new songs were quite bad. It all started with Dayjob, Victim and Foolish Heart. Then it went downhill from there with Wave to The Wind, Corrina, etc... You can salm me all you want, but that's the truth.",

Have the tape locked away with the other ones (pun intended) so its nice to have access to it on here... 5 stars for the experience. Love & Light",

It was a lot of peoples exception on Jerry that brought him down, when all along he just wanted to have fun. I'll never forget these show.  Thinking and writing about this brings tears to my eyes,  I miss him so much!",
