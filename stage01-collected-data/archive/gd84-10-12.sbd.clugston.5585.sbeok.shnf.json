While the source is ID'ed as a Master Soundboard Cassette, check out the text file and find out that from mid-UJB until the end of the show there is an AUD patch.  This really burns me up because that part of the show that is MSC is really high quality, whereas the AUD patch is decent, not great.  It turns what was probably a 4.5 show into something less, which is too bad, because this show does have some fine moments .. the UJB and Morning Dew especially, during the 2d set.  I will say that while this is a fine fine Dew, comparisons to Cornell, or even the 9/18/87 version are a bit of a stretch.\n\nHad this MSC been a full show, I'd give it a 4, the AUD patch drops it down to a 3.\n\nNEUTRAL RECOMMENDATION",

I wonder where the rest of the show is...\nHopefully its residing in the vaults somewhere.\n\nI think I might actually buy it if it comes out. \n\nlegit 4.5 stars for the playing (5 goes to the Cornell's etc..)\n\n2 stars for the awol 2nd set.\n\nMy favorite show from '84.",

A Quick time Jack \u2013A-Roe \u2018This couple they got married\u2019 (Let the dance marathon begin). Used to LOVE Her-Another tune not always a regular, (Bobby sounds hoarse too!)

Sounds like the blues too me! The way Brent presents this tune is part of the problem; it is kind of an awkward song at times. But I know what the man was feeling!\nThis was the show I believe where Jerry walked off during \u2018Don\u2019t Need Love\u2019 and came back to lead the band into a heartfelt \u2018Uncle John\u2019s\u2019 \u2013We do NEED LOVE! \nThe Drums and Space are nice; this was one of those very small venues the Dead would squeeze in off the beaten path, as you can tell- well worth the effort to be at such an intimate show.\n\nI have just read the rest of the reviews. Yes, there are sound quality issues but if we are just talking which show just kills for this East Coast tour and has a dream set list that is very well played -this show gets my vote. \n\nI like the comments about \u2018LOVE\u2019 posted by SFCwent, Love seem to be the common theme of this show, almost all the tunes have a tie in to love in some way. \n\nPost Drumz--------Playin >Uncle John\u2019s Reprise > DEW!\n\nListen to the collective roar that goes up for the rare GOOD LOVIN encore",

The whole scene was a blast outside and inside the civic center (though I do recall seeing bogus tour tickets being sold for $20).\n\nThe 12th was a high-energy burner from the outset and was incredible throughout. I'm pretty sure the long whistle you hear in Cold Rain & Snow is my pal Mark. I hadn't listened to this show for a while, but it sure brought back memories.\n\nI just caught two very fun Lesh shows in NYC during his long run at the Nokia, and as good as those shows sounded, it's plain to see that there was nothing like a GD concert. No knock against Phil. But when the Dead delivered the goods, no matter the era, the music took you places that no other group can (at least to this fan). \n\nDefinitely a top-5 among the 150 shows I saw from 1977-1995.",

      "review_text": "Top Ten for 1984 !! \"Even the lobsters were tripping tonight\"\n                  - attendee at 10/12/84\n\nI can't believe I'm picking yet another October show for my top tens, but there's just no denying that this Fall run in the east was really a high point in the year. There was some serious competition from 10/11 and 10/15, both available\nonly as AUD sources, and please do yourself a favor and check out those fine AUD recordings, esp. the Oade sources. Great shows, as is 10/17. I must've listened to over parts of 6 different shows tonight trying to pick my top ten. This one, however, was an immediate standout from the first song, I knew this show had that extra ingredient, that mojo touch that makes it special. An excellent representation of the 1984 sound here, full, lots of bass, depth and a certain 1984 ambiance I can't explain - others have called it \"melty\" \"being underwater\" \"gooey\" or \"like a warm fuzzy something\".\n\nI'm surprised that I ended up picking this one, because usually the song lists are a major factor in what makes a show special for me. And this song list doesn't thrill me at all. No Estimated,\nno Terrapin, no Scarlet>Fire, not even an Other One or a Shakedown!!\nBut everything is played with such energy and soul that even the mediocre songs shine. I feel the same way about the 5/6/89 show at the Frost. Kinda lame song list that includes Pocky Way.\nBut my God what a show that is! So you can't always tell the quality of a show from the sets, like the book/cover thing. But I digress.\n\nStranger, never one of my favorites somehow is \"just perfect\" as the opener tonight. Really confident and tight playing, gets the show off to a blazing start. Stranger is kinda the \"Dancin\"\nof the 80's for me, since Dancin started so many sets in the late 70's.\nRoses is a semi rare treat, and Jerry delivers a soulful version with just a little croak for sincerity's sake. Ditto for Jack a Roe, pulled out of retirement since 1982. Great to hear it again here, and it adds to the uniqueness of the set. Cumberland smokes like a fatty. The coffee is perking now. Then the closer, Music just cruises like a well maintained sports car. Garcia wails and then wails some more. You wish it lasted longer, but all in all a very strong set that gets your attention and pulls you in.\n\nThe Cold Rain opener is for me, further validation that this is a Jerry show tonight, with him taking the lead in setting the vibe\nfor the group. The Roses and Jack a Roe in Set One told us that, and the stunning Uncle John>Morning Dew to come in Set Two will clinch this as a night when Garcia parted the Haze just enough to deliver a clear and focused performance, while still leaving enough Haze to put that extra layer of mystery and magic to\neach song.\nAs mainly a 1969 to 1977 kinda listener, it took me a long time to warm up to Sailor/Saint when I started listening to 80's shows. Then I \"got it\" about this pairing and I've since considered them\nsome of my favorite Bob songs, of which there are not many. Sailor is kinda Bob's \"Terrapin\" you know? Mystical, with cascading runs from Jerry, deep lyrics, mythical even. This pairing, even though I would prefer a Help>Slipknot or a\nPlayin in this spot, nevertheless takes the set to the next level. Some scorching leads from Jerry on Saint. Great vocals by all here as well. At over 7 minutes, they do some \"saintly\" jamming\nthat sounds at times like a Dark Star on steroids, or at a faster tempo.\nOkay, so then we get Don't Need Love. But let's not forget that even in the primo year of 1973 we had to put up with \"You're Not Woman Enough\". And, the Uncle John's Band that follows quickly\nmakes up for the weak spot. At 11 minutes, there's plenty of fine jamming, with Jerry weaving colored curlicues of music in the air.\nThen instead of bringing back the chorus, they drift into a 5 minute Jam that sounds like Dark Star, China Doll or Sage and Spirit all in one. This lovely UJB>Jam is truly one of the high points of 1984 and a prime example of what they were still capable of even if 1972 was 12 years past.\nJerry and Bob do some nice duets during Space. Then we get the \"leftover\" Playin reprise that they didn't do on 10/11, which is a fun little joke for those that were stoned enough to get it. Jerry plays with the theme for awhile with Bob and Brent filling in with trippy background counterpoint.\nAnd speaking of leftovers, what about that last chorus of UJB? They leave no turn unstoned tonight, giving us a splendid short jam and then the gorgeous harmonies at the end. The ease with\nwhich the boys flow from Playin to UJB into Morning Dew immediately brings to mind those famous sandwiches from 1973 using this trio of songs.\nI'll leave you to discover this Dew on your own, oh intrepid ones. Suffice to say that this is one of \"the\" songs that really shone brightly in 1984, and this version is a show stopper. Jerry sings his liver out, and maybe a few other organs besides. Brent's Leslie is making the whole arena spin, and even on this AUD patch in Set Two, Phil's bombs are devastating. Jerry channels Duane Allman for some killer bending leads, then brings the whole thing to a roaring climax. Did the Civic Center need roof repair after this?\n\nWith Good Lovin for an encore, the only thing that would improve this is a full SBD source with the Charlie Miller treatment. CM, hello?\nVery recommended for 1984 virgins.\n\nEnjoy,\nDr. Flashback",

This was probably the best, this and Hartford and Syracuse, maybe second night at Brendan Byrne.  I also liked Richmond a lot, second night at the Centrum.\n\nThis is not a sbd for the whole show.  Still a good source.  I loved this show, and all the Cumberland County Civic shows I saw from '80-'86 and Lewiston '80, loved Maine shows - one of the few northeast places that was a special place unlike all the sterile arenas, especially the ratholes in Nassau or Hartford or Providence or the hideous MSG, easily the worst place ever to see a rock show. Now the Palladium was a different story, that place was awesome.  MSG sucked.  \n\nBut to say this was the best show of the 1980's is absolutely ludicrous. Out of my 330 shows I saw about 120-130 from '72-'79.  Then from '80-'86 I saw close to 180, many of which were better than this show.  A couple of the Warfield shows in '80, especially 10/14, Halloween '80, Lewiston '80, New Years '81, the Greeks in '81, Amsterdam '81, Buffalo '81, all of summer tour '85, Fox Theater '85, some of the Oakland shows in '85, Greek '84, BCT Halloween run '84, Halloween '83, and Eugene/Red Rocks/Boise 1983 all come to mind pretty quickly, among 20 or 30 others.  Starlight '82, Merriweather '83 and '84, Rochester '85, Mardi Gras '86, etc., etc., etc.\n\nCheck this out as well as the rest of this tour.\n\nAnd who's the clown that said nothing in the first set here?  How clueless, and obviously not a Dead Head who was actually seeing shows.  This was easily the best first set in 1984.  I hadn't seen On the Road Again live since 1981 or 1982, of course I saw it acoustic a few times in '80. Jack-a-Roe is always rare.  To see them both in one night is beyond rare.  Stranger was pretty good, not quite as hot as 10/18 or Hampton 4/14 of that year (another great Dew). And this is the best Music Never Stopped of 1984.",
