The jam is mellow and not bad but not great.\n\nThe reason you should get this is for the Viola Lee Blues. At 20 minutes in length, you know there's some serious stuff goin' down.\n\nThe vocal are better than usual for the time, but what makes this spectacular is how Jerry is exploring every possible opprotunity that the song affords. At first the jams are pretty mellow, but Jerry brings them up to the song's natural intenseness. Then something weird happens. The keyboards are playing Caution. Then Phil's playing Caution. Jerry still won't bite and go for a Caution Jam inside the tune. Then you hear Bob playing some Caution! Jerry won't have any part of it. The song is Viola Lee Blues and he's not gonna go for the bait. After the climax is reached in the final jam and the song reprises itself, Jerry milks it much longer than usual before going back into the final vocal run. Even after that point, the song goes on.\n\nThe tape cuts when the music is still playing. It sounds like Jerry is going to go into another song, but I can't be sure what.\n\nThis is a must-have just for that one song. A 20 minute Viola Lee Blues? More than definately worth the download.",

The jamming is usually pretty good, but the singing is just BAD (sorry fellas.) This version is funny though, cuz Jerry opens saying \"This next song is called New Potato Caboose, don't ya know.\" I always loved Jerry's comments in the early days (see 5/5/67's stage banter for a better example!) \nThe true gem here is the Viola Lee. Clocking in at 20:20, this is a true marvel. I always loved this song, and this is probably one of my favorites. The vocals are spot on and the jamming is precise and awe-inspiring. This is SUCH a good version. And the sound quality is pretty much perfect. There's a little hiss, but that's nothing. Listen to other 67 recordings and you'll see that this small amount of hiss is NOTHING.\nThis is seriously some VERY good early stuff. Agressive (not 68 agressive, but close) primal dead at its best. Seriously consider downloading this stuff!!",

Jerry plays some great speedy licks, true,  but that's not enough to really make it a great version. You want a SMOKIN' Viola from '67? Try 6/18 or 9/3. Those Violas kick this one in its proverbial ass. The New Potato is OK, nothing special. \nThis show makes good filler.",

Both Jerry and Phil do a good Viola Lee, though the New Potato is average for '67.\n\nViola Lee different, in that it is one of the first performances to end in feedback, one of the first extended feedbacks. Through 1966 and much of '67 they ended on the chord. But they had recently performed at the Monterey Pop festival, where Jimi Hendrix shocked the audience with 5 minutes of feedback, during which he burned and smashed his guitar--feedback still going. \n\nInstead of violence during the feed back, the Dead go into campy vaudeville \"outtro\" that they had been ending shows with this year. Unfortunately, it's cut off here.\n\nFrom this Monterey/Hendrix-inspired feedback ending, the Dead would expand feedback into a lengthy \"song\" in it's own right. Over the years, this evolved into the \"space\" that was a standard part of shows for decades.",
