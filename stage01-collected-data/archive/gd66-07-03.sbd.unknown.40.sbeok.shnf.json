Dancing In The Streets, as sung with their best early attempts at harmony, is a sweet early version.\n\nThe song soon became an extended set piece as can be heard on the psyched-out version of Sept. 16th, '66 (used on the Vintage Dead album). \n \nHe Was A Friend Of Mine brings it all back home. \nWith that vibrato sound of Jerry's early vocals, and emotion in his delivery this is a particularly heartfelt version.\nThe song always makes me think of my father,  a down to earth '60s dude, he was a friend of Luria Castell (founding Family Dog member) back in '63.\nThe song also invokes memories of a friend to all of us who recently passed on - the founding father of the Family Dog, Chet Helms, who ran the beloved Avalon Ballroom as only a true hippie can, loosely.\nAvalon Ballroom was THE place to party thanks to Chet.  \n\nViola Lee Blues moves along at a nice clip - and passes the acid test after Jerry's loopy spoken intro.\n\nBig Boss Man is delivered with a snarl by Pigpen. \n\nSitting On Top Of The World is hard and fast...\nwho says they never knew how to play this even when they played it?\n\nNext Time You See Me, a regular cover they performed mostly in 1966 before reviving it in 1969 (having played it once in 1967 and about 4 times in 1968 - going by what's available here in the archive.) \n I saw it with Jerry joining in happily with Pigpen on vocals, at the Fillmore West on August 19, 1970.\n\nBy 1970 their repetoire seemed tinged with a touch of nostalgia for these hazy lazy crazy days of summer '66,  before \"love\" tore the Haight apart.\n\nThe official Vault collection of 1966 Oddities includes 2 live songs with this July 3rd date: the very rare Pigpen sung \"Don't Mess Up A Good Thing\" and something even more intriguing entitled \"Gangster Of Love\".\n\nA few chops and cuts here and there, to be expected with the early reels, but the sound overall is excellent.",

Compared to other versions, this one is short (4 minutes), peppy and fast with a rock beat, Pig's organ is squeeling along.  The voices sound great and very clear on this recording.  Jerry's voice does a funny fluttering thing.  Some of the later versions of He Was A Friend Of Mine in the Archive extend to 7, 10, and 14 minutes, most at a slower pace than this one.",

      "review_text": "Close to the chest <br />This is one of the rare shows that has been officially released (nearly) complete, when only a soundboard portion circulated. A night out with the Dead at the Fillmore in '66 was just the usual - they played it 46 times in '66/'67 (along with other Bay Area spaces, though this is the \"Independence Ball\"). This isn't the cream of '66, but the sound quality is nice. Before Primal Dead, there was Rudimentary Dead; in between garage/club band and Psychedelic Ballroom Dead. You listen to a show from this early for different reasons (one being the curios). Bear separated the vox into one channel, using the tech of the day to minimize bleed. We do not have the previous 12 shows; the previous confirmed show we have is 5/19/66 at the Avalon. We also don't have the next four, until  7/16/66 at The Fillmore.\n\nFirst Set. The SBD comes in late on <i>Nobody's Fault</i>. Most of the set is similar to all shows from the era, though <i>I Know You Rider</i> sparkles. There's a fade-in to <i>Just a Hand to Hold</i>. <i>Next Time You See Me</i> is so uptempo! Bill's drumming stands out on <i>Viola Lee</i>. Blair picks this version, with a fine quote, \"feral intensity with parts interlocking by kismet\". They were becoming more potent by the month, as seen in the improving <i>Big Boss Man</i>. This would really have been something else in the pre-Satanic Majesties/Sgt. Peppers/Village Green Preservation rockverse. <i>Sitting on Top of the World</i> is both rudimentary and explosive. <i>Keep Rolling By</i> is  followed by a Teddy Bear's Picnic tuning.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Minglewood</i> + Bobby vox = ouch! <i>Cold Rain & Snow</i> is super-speedy, and a perfect example of the '66 arrangement (i. e., the album version). Proof they were a blues band: <i>Tastebud</i>. The <i>Beat it on Down the Line</i>-6 is right when they started counting-in. Garcia is ahead of his time here, but otherwise it's rough. Though, like most young bands, the rhythm section speeds up on almost every song in summer '66, here the tempo slows. <i>Cream Puff War</i> is  simpler than it would become just weeks later, but it has a jam section that's surprising. Fontella Bass's <i>Don't Mess Up a Good Thing</i> was only a year old. Booker T issued an instrumental version at the same time the Dead began began covering the song. You can tell that <i>Cardboard Cowboy</i> was too cumbersome  to work out - even though it was the shortest thing they ever wrote (it sounds like early Airplane). The 7/29 version is best. <i>Gangster of Love</i> and <i>You Don't Have to Ask</i> were also short-lived. On the latter Bobby sings off-key and though it's not as good as 7/16, check out @1:20, when Jer leads the abrupt key change. The Wilson Pickett original of <i>Midnight Hour</i> was also then-current, and though it was just a 2\u00bdmin single, the boys had already started jamming it out - to 15min! They had also given a section of the show to Pigpen's aud interactions. You had to be there for this one.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 2\u00bd stars [full show]\n\nHighlights:\nI Know You Rider - Jer looks a year ahead\nSitting on Top of the World - some explosive Jer\nCold Rain & Snow - perfect example of the '66\n\nSOURCES: Complete on <b>30 Trips</b>, though several tracks have fade-ins with the beginnings clipped. Don't Mess Up a Good Thing & Gangster of Love are on <b>Rare Cuts</b>. Cream Puff is on <b>Definitive Live Story</b>. The SBD tracks are mislabeled and play:\nDancing in the Streets\nI Know You Rider  [cut]\nJust a Hand to Hold [beginning cut]\nNext Time You See Me\nViola Lee Blues\nBig Boss Man\nSittin' on Top of the World [cut]\nThe 139751_sbd_miller has correct labels, and adds the first 7\" single tracks (in iffy quality).",
