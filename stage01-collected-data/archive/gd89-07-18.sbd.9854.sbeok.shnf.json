      "review_text": "What a night... We kind of wormed our way down toward the stage inbetween sets and ended up in an area roped off by \"police line\" tape.  We sat down, and nobody said anything, so we held our breaths and the lights went down and the game was on.  \n\nThe first set definitely whet our appetite, and the second delivered on the yummies.  The Sugar Mags was and always will be a great way to start a set, and this one was a ton of fun.  I remember dancin' my ass off during the jam out of Sugar Mags, when all of a sudden I hear Jerry sing \"As I was walkin' round Grovernor's Square...\".  WOW, they sure slipped that transition in there sweet as can be.  NICE...now we're really into it...but there was a little piece of nice, flat, open space right in front of the stage just to the right of the speaker stack behind Brent..so, what the hell, we abandoned our seats and went for it.  \nThere was a security guard sitting right on the stage right where we wanted to dance, and he seemed completely oblivious to us.  I took off my glasses, my shirt and my shoes and set them right next to the speaker stack and proceeded to dance my ass off for the rest of the show...except for the China Doll of course.  \n\nI couldn't believe our luck in finding this space that the 3 of us shared for that magical second set.  Great, LOUD sound...plenty of flat space to boogie, and a security guard to watch my stuff while I did the apoplectic boneless arm dance all night.  \n\nThis was one fun night...but man, did it start rainin' during that second set, and it never stopped...",

That being said, I prefer the combo from 3/27/88 because they jam out the Sugar much more before revving up an absolutely insane Scarlet>Fire.\n\nAs for this show, I've had a cassette copy of set II for more than 10 years.  It was nice to finally get to hear the rock-solid first set; Minglewood and Bird Song are particularly sweet.  Sound quality is superb.  Definitely a must have.",

      "review_text": "Alpine baby and good ole grateful dead. This is one 3-night run I dont have to wish I was at. I live on the border of WI and IL near the lake. So this was a regular thing for me since 87. This last run here was so fun hanging out with buddies smoking dank, doin' some shrooms, drinking some brews and the hot girls running around. The venue itself is a cool out-door ski hill ampitheater with trees in the backround.  I remember thinking it looked kind of like a story pop up book. I ate some gooney birds and got into the Touch of grey opener seeing rainbow trails off Jerry's opening guitar solo and groving with everyone out on the lawn and then headed down into the pavilion for second set. Awesome show. \n The Jerry Garcia band played after this in Sept. and I had to catch that also. Hitting Deercreek and prior to that in the spring the Milwaukee Mecca shows 4/15 and 4/16/89 were such sick shopws I couldn't believe what I jamming to at the I noticed  they improved in this 89 spring tour from 88. I was getting crushed by the dead in that small cozy arena down town. Those shows and this Summer run were such a treat its unbelievable.",

IMO, these three nights are the best \"post coma\" dead shows....PERIOD!  They have it all...and the boys are playing so well together...the energy is electric from the first note of Good Times on 7/17 all the way through the last note of Lovelight on 7/19.

Alpine Valley is the culmination of  Summer 89, arguably being the best run they ever played. This night, while not the best of the three, is outstanding. Brent proves he the best keyboardist the GD ever had; check out his playing on memphis blues and mr fantasy. Like mentioned previously, the transition of sugarmag>scarlet is PHENOMENAL!! Their transitions are typically either standard originals(cant think of a better synonym) (ie: the China>Rider transition) or a transitionary song will be played right after the previous one (ie:Terrapin>Playin). Thats what makes this segue so amazing and unique. The transition is more like SurgarMag>Sunshine Daydream tease>Scarlet. The segue is seamless and sounds perfectly natural. The crowd goes absolutely nuts when Jer bust out, \"When I was walking...\" This is one of the best transitions I've ever heard the GD play. BTW, the song themselves kick ass. Jerry and brent play the hell out of the second set.",

      "review_text": "Proof that Brent is the best Keys Player the dead had, First off, this show is awesome. The second set is the place to listen here. It starts off with an amazing transition sugar magnolia -> scarlet begonias. the transition is so flawless, the jam out of sugar mag sounds like sunshine daydream, but it just fades into scarlet begonias like one fluid song (just listen for yourself). By the way phil absolutely rips on this begonias; the fills he just throws in there are incredible. After this i usually skip right to the juicy eyes, everybody is on on this version, and Brent really makes some great contributions. Brent is really up in the mix for the entire show creating a presence i never felt with godchaux nor appreciated with the later hornsby and welnick. \n\nchina doll is solid and beautiful. Brent shines again in dear mr. fantasy->hey jude. His voice is so unbelievably high and has a wonderful raspy undercurrent to it that is straight up amazing. they wrap up the show with a sweet sunshine daydream and an encore of quinn, finishing the show in true '89 fashion",

I'm in Cali and got to see many shows from '87-'90. Some considered very special shows, and this Alpine has always been toted as one. Now I know why, just damn hot! Phil is all over the place, he started with Jack and never stopped, it seemed that he was leading the band that night, JMO.\n\nNow time to bitch, lol.  This show would've PERFECT, in my opinion, if they lead off with Music or maybe even an old classic opener of China/Rider, but that's a stretch. Music fits very nicely with the theme.  But my real complaint is Bobby's whiney choice of Throwing out of that sweet Fantasy/Jude.  \"Front Spot Light\" Weir couldn't keep the mood and go in Let It Grow/Sunshine. It's perfect fit, at least it seems so to me.\n\nThat's, this shows rocks!!! Take it now and save it on back-up.  Definitely a keeper!!!\n\nThanks guys for this beautiful gift...\n\nPeace,\nAudiohead22\naudiophilehead@hotmail.com",

It is so hard to rate this greatest 3 night stand in the history of the band, when the powerful potential of the MIDI experiment was realized in a way that would lead to some of the epic shows of the fall(including the return of help>slipknot and dark star), but this night is kind of the \"fun\" night of the three. The touch opener, pair of jacks, and the absolutely MINDBLOWING Sugar>Scarlet transistion tell me that the band was just reveling in the fact that they were just flat out ON FIRE. A really fun setlist, perfect for the middle night of this run, and appropriate after the absolute atomic bomb of energy that was the 2nd set from the previous night. So sad that the soundboard from 7/17 is no longer on the archive. Thanks to Bobby and Ratdog for that.",

Much has already been said about the Sugar Mag Scarlet transition and it's great, but check out the drums and space.

Of the 150 or so shows that I attended these were right up there with the best. These are must have shows for your collection. The recordings are excellent and take me back to a wonderful experience that will never be reproduced. They never returned to Alpine and it truly was downhill from here. While I saw many shows after these(and obviously before), these 3 performances capture the true essence of the Grateful Dead. Also,check out May '77 and summer of'85.

      "review_text": "Excellent show Overall: why does the previous night get more attention than this night??  Just b/c they released a video of that night??  I think this night is actually better, but that\u2019s just me.  Phil is simply all over the place here.  Great stuff.  Great recording as well, although I\u2019d also love to hear a high quality AUD or matrix for this show.  But I\u2019ll also reiterate that I think while these were fantastic shows, I think they get a little blown out of proportion.  I think the Cal Expo and Greek shows after this were just as good and, of course, fall 89 and then spring 90 were on a whole \u2018nuther level (NOT just b/c of MIDI).  Just my opinion.  \n\nThe scene: welcome to the mudbowl.  The rain began the previous night after the show and it was torrential at times leading up to this show.  By the time the show started, people were sliding down the hill, creating a mud/water slide.  But if memory serves correct, I don\u2019t think it actually rained during this show (maybe just towards the very end?), which is always helpful for those of us not under the shell!  \n\nThe music:  it\u2019s all good here.  Obviously, this is an incredible Phil show, but everyone is on.  Jerry\u2019s solo on FOTD is a favorite 1st set moment here for me.  Bird Song>Promised Land smokes nicely.  As for the Mags>Scarlet transition, I\u2019ll say it is very smooth, but it\u2019s only about one minute with no \u201cjamming\u201d just a subtle change in chord progression (the two songs are very similar chordwise, so the real wonder is that they didn\u2019t do this combo more often), so I\u2019m not sure I agree with the hoopla that it\u2019s really \u201camazing.\u201d  Nice Eyes>jam.
