      "review_text": "No Neal Rap At This Show The Neal Cassady rap, as the notes to this show indicate was not on 11/10/67. It was an acid test like rap probably given on 7/23/67 at the Straight Theatre with a Dead supplied background. An annotation of the rap is online at: http://www.pugzine.com/arch01.html . Neal was known to rap on many things at the same time which must have led to a lot of confused people. Those who could pick up on at least a few of his thoughts/jokes would certainly be laughing. An example is: \n\n\"Logical Positivism had a great increase at UCLA recently they got Alcindor but no water polo...what are we gonna...? you all are surrounded...I've never found who was...I played short short...outfield-no glove...you just need...I learned an illegal pitch-caught Satch Paige59 barehanded...\" The Alcindor refers to Lou Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul Jabbar. \n\n\nThe highlights here are the jam in Viola Lee and Pigpen's Good Morning Little School Girl. On It Hurts Me Too listen to that blues guitar that Jerry plays and of course a classic performance by Pigpen. \n\nThe Grateful Dead were certainly making music unlike any other group in 1967. \n\nSound is good for '67.",

His guitar play was never near as fierce later on and the sound he got from his amp was one bad ass sound (Viola Lee Blues being the best example) along with the Les Paul which I will continue to comment was his most fitting guitar.\n\nOn to the show.  Great quality on the first four songs not including hoot jeer.  Then on the Neal Cassidy it sucks, but it isn't of any importance.  Then for the last half.  It is only a little less than the first four, but performance fuckin' rips all the way through.  The guys were on fire.",

Until fairly recently, 72 was about as far back as I went. Their sound had changed (evolved?) significantly by that time. I love hearing how through-the-decades staples sounded in 67, like Morning Dew and Estimated Prophet, when effects were more limited, but they played more rootsy, tighter, and maybe more authentically than they did later down the road.  \nThe Cassady rap is cool to hear, too. Red Tom Wolfe's \"Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\" some time back, and it's cool to hear somebody rapping the way it was described in the book. Quite a trip.\nThere are no weak cuts here. A great example of a great phase.",

      "review_text": "Parts of this Caution mixed on Anthem of the Sun. One of the great Cautions. Starts with a bluesy, mellow Viola Lee--before the speedup. This was NOT one of the first times for Hurts Me Too. At this time it was one of their oldies--they played it most of 1966. Listen also to Phil\u2019s walking bass here. A fine group effort. \n\nJerry fires it up on Morning Dew\u2014again, with some great accompaniment from Phil. It\u2019s not Jerry soloing, but a Jerry and Phil duet. A fine Dew.\n\nNot one of the better Cryptical/Other Ones of the year, sloppier than most. (Check out 10/22/67 here at archive, for instance.) The Neal Cassady rap is pretty interesting, done over the \u201cLovelight\u201d riff. (Neal Cassady is \u201cCowboy Neal at the wheel\u201d of the Other One, for those who didn\u2019t know.) The Notes below says this is from a 7/23/67 Acid Test.\n\nA great Alligator: bluesy, psychedelic, energetic and spacy at times, going to a 22-minute frenetic Caution, for me, the show highlight. This Caution\nebbs and flows, changing direction\u2014kind of the way Playing in the Band did in the early-mid \u201870s, but sounding very different. We get several Phil solos, Pigpen harp solos, Pigpen rapping over space effects, and some fiery outbreaks from Jerry. It evolves into acid space, then it absolutely explodes near the end and fades into space, like a supernova. A great way to end a 60\u2019s Dead show.",

Nice to hear it again.\n\nHere's one way to download this show:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer. \n\nRealPlayer is a free media player you can download at www.realplayer.com. \n\nUsing RealPlayer to view this webpage, click the VBR M3U link to open the songs in the Playlist.

PENGUIN: Pocket book of On the Road by Jack Kerouac.\n\n2. PHIL: Phil Lesh, bassist of the Grateful Dead.\n\n3. BIC: Cigarette lighter, noted because Phil had no light. Five o'clock in the morning at the Watts Acid Test, light barely glimmering. Phil was still thumoing when Babbs shut down the power. \"No light! No light!\" Phil screamed, but to no avail. It didn't come back.\n\n4. ROASTA BEEF: Riffing on the chow at the Straight-always the worst, and Cassady was a truck driver's special man, hated ratburgers.\n\n5. FOUR FINGERS: Pertains to his flute playing, \"Three finger delight,\" he said, \"no, that's masturbation,\" but in this case he's threatening to play the flute like he always did while driving the big bus Furthur, thus the groans from the musicians.\n\n6. CLAW: His hand with the tip of thumb cut off. (See On the Road for best explanation for how it happened.)\n\n7. METRO: The law. Police station. Clenches his fist to hide the thumb and reveal the torso, muscles tense.\n\n8. SPENCE: Dick Spence, a connection, always drive past his place, no telling what might be available.\n\n9. HEINZ: As in '56 flavors in '57, or was it the other way around?\n\n10. 6 SEEDS: busted for seeds the waiter was, can you believe it?\n\n11. LAUDATORY: Refers to a 6 page letter to Gavin Arthur who visited Cassady in San Quentin when Neal was doing two years for two joints; lotta time on his hands. My brother's bar in Neal's hometown of Denver has the letter on the wall.\n\n12. THE WALL: Some of the best writings can be found on the shit-house wall.\n\n13. 20 YEARS: Cassady's a bit older than the audience in the theater. He's being heckled.\n\n14. PAISLEY: In vogue amongst the younger set; why not join in? \"If you want to be loved, be lovable,\" Cassady often said.\n\n15. SON OF THE MAN: Christological reference to San Francisco's Mayor's son. Chip Alioto.\n\n16. Roger GRIMSBY: San Francisco television reporter.\n\n17. MARCO GREG: Nightclub critic always thought Cassady was putting everyone on. \"Talks about cars a lot, doesn't he?\"\n\n18. JUST IN TIME: To save the lady from committing suicide, she's at her nitwit's end.\n\n19. WINNEMUCCA: Nevada: east of Reno on Interstate 80. Site of the Mustang Ranch, a a barbed wire enclosed bordello. The management dug Neal so much they didn;t charge him for services rendered. Always a quick stop for Neal when heading East out of Frisco.\n\n20. ENDURANCE: \"What, what? Consistency,\" Cassady said. \"Not how you come out of the blocks or make the first turn.\" You gotta be in it for the long haul.\n\n21. VIC'S VAPORUB: Mentholated version of the popular lubricant.\n\n22. FIRST CHILD '42: One of many kids alleged to have been fathered by a young Neal in Los Angeles and Denver.\n\n23. CHARLIE VALENCIA: her boy friend.\n\n24. TEMPLE: Street in L.A.\n\n25. ACID TEST: Were held in L.A. in spring of '66, Cassady the star, Grateful Dead the band, Pranksters the crew, Furtur the bus.\n\n26. 1350: Street address on temple. Now a shrine to the CKC nuts. (Cassady Kerouac Corso). The Cassady virus was brought across the border on the bottom of the sneakers of a wetback. Cassady was all man. From the top of his head to the bottom of his feet-to the very sole. They say clothes can't go to heaven but those shoes had sole. Other soles picked up the Cassady Virus and it's since spread across country and now into Europe. \"After us, the deluge,\" Kerouac said, a soulful man.\n\n27. ANTHONY QUINN: the actor who was shooting a movie called Guns for San Sebastian in Mexico and involved with Neal's last lover. She had to make a choice between Neal or Quinn, she chose Neal.\n\n28. SORTOFA: Read all about it in Carolyn Cassady's book, Heartbeat.\n\n29. COLORED GIRL: Neal and Jack took her to Neal's house in Los Gatos and past Carolyn asleep and up the pull-down stairs to the attic, pushing the girl's ass to get her through the hole when Carolyn woke up. It was Neal's birthday and he was supposed to be wining and dining Carolyn under candlelight but Jack called to say he'd been busted, could Neal come bail him out? \"Back in 'alf a mo' darling,\" and that was hours ago the candles have burned out Carolyn is pissed. What do you think she did to get even?\n\n30. KEROASSADY: the composite Jack/Neal: a hybrid personality that did 'em both in.\n\n31. SUICIDE: After Carolyn got her revenge, Neal was so devastated he sat in the car with a gun in his hand all night fighting over suicide being wrong versus I don't wanna go. He rejected suicide as an option and decided to go home and beg.\n\n32. FORD SIGN: Billboard where you turn West driving from Manhattan to the coast.\n\n33. VANHELLUTHER: Preacher who lectured Neal on the wonders of Valballa, home of the warriors slain in battle.\n\n34. DIDN'T SEE IT: Blessed are the peacemakers-for they shall be called the sons of God. \"There is no excuse for violence,\" Cassady said, \"except when making love.\"\n\n35. MENOPAUSAL: Just as the woman stops bleeding, the peacemaker declines to shed blood. The grace that comes with age.\n\n36. 20 YEARS: My, how time do fly. To think, 20 years gone by already, like a blink of the eye. Kerouac said, \"Cassady knew time.\"\n\n37. RAILROAD: Neal was a brakeman on the railroad for ten years, with an impeccable record, never missed a train, but when he went to prison, lost his job, his pension, his wife, his home.\n\n38. 10 MORE FOR: For what? Not even Cassady could predict that. But he still was going to give it all he got in whatever time he got left. DEAD A THOUSAND YEARS: the orthodox lapse between incarnations.\n\n39. REB PARKER/AL COLLINS: Old runaround friend of Cassady's he ran into at the Acid Test.\n\n40. AUROBINDO: Savant who knew body functions from having existed at one time or another as every organ in the body, so he was a soothsayer alright-could tell you straight what alcohol did to you, and Cassady was always scared of the booze what with growing up on skidrow Larimer Street in Denver with his wino father.\n\n41. D INSTEADA T: A Nealish proto AA injunctive?\n\n42. PORNOGRAPHY: Those German drink so much beer it's obscene.\n\n43. ALL SAINTS Church: Downtown Denver where Neal was an alter boy.\n\n44. 4 WHEEL DRIFT: Auto racing. A Stirling Moss technique. Going around corners giving it the gas and breaking at the same time. You slide but don't cartwheel if you do it just right.\n\n45. HEEL AND TOE: Heel on the brake, toe on the gas.\n\n46. DOUBLE LEFT: Cassady was left handed, so left-footed too, and couldn't manipulate the heel and toe with his right foot.\n\n47. PIGPEN: Ron McKermnan: vocalist and keyboardist for the Grateful Dead. Since deceased.\n\n48. GINSBERG: Allen the ubiquitous poet.\n\n49. THE GUY: Luther Frease, RIP, who worked at the Springfield News across the street from the Springfield Creamery.\n\n50. BROTHER CHUCK: Ken Kesey's brother, who owns and operates the Springfield Creamery (not the Eugene Creamery) Chuck is also an original Merry Prankster who was on the bus, Furthur, in 1964 when Cassady drove.\n\n51. ROCKY OVERHANG: Luther's furrowed brow.\n\n52. ED SANDERS: Leader of the Fugs, radical music group of the 60's. He also wrote book, The Family, about Charles Manson.\n\n53. 2-16: Union card. He's riffing about the fleet, never having been in the Navy or any other branch of service, being color-blind...\"I was out there on the grass and all,\" Cassady said, \"and to me it looked red. The grass red? You're nuts. I was so mad at that grass I learned cars.\"\n\n54. 4TH LARGEST UNION: Railroad brakemen.\n\n55. OBETROL: Great speed. An OBETROL 10 tablet contained: 2.5 mg. each of Methamphetamine saccharate, Methamphetamine hydrocloride, Amphetamine sulfate, & Dextroamphetamine sulfate. OBETROL 20's contained twice this potency.\n\n56. THE TIRES: at the Los Gatos Tire Company while on parole after stretch in San Quentin.\n\n57. EXTENSION: for his socket wrench.\n\n58. ALCINDOR: Later known as Kareem Abdul Jabbar.\n\n59. SATCH PAIGE: Ancient Negro pitcher finally made it to the big leagues with the Indians at age of sixty-something.\n\n60. NELL: The nurse in W.C. Fields comedy.\n\n61. STIFF DR. PECK, DOUBLE REED: Carolyn worked for a spell as receptionist to Radiological Associates; Dr.'s Clemmer M. Peck, MD, & Robert H. Reid, MD. DOUBLE REED: The oboe, most difficult of instruments to play. You gotta get just the right lip on it.\n\n62. DILLINGER: John, the 30's gangster shot down as he left The Biograph movie theater, Chicago-July, 1934.\n\n63. ROBERT JONES MELVIN: Religious leader who got rich from donations, but after all, gotta drive a Caddilac, you think they'll give money to a man in a clunker?\n\n64. CHARGE TO ASTROLOGIZE: No money changers in the temple. \n\nhttp://wild-bohemian.com/cassady1.htm",

The jam in Alligator on Anthem is different though -- I'm pretty sure it's from Valentine's Day 1968 (Feb 14) at the Carolusel Ballroom (edited down a bit but mostly all there).\n\nThis jam is excellent too, maybe second only to that one.",
