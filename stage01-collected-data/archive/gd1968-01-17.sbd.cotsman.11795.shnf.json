Although, the years at times blend into each there are noted stylistic shifts at the beginnings of each year.  This show is no exception.  Apparently back from an out of town tour, the Dead introduce several new shows at this show to start 68 off.  This is a five star show for so many reasons, being a complete show with great quality and the debut of new material at the turn of a new year, to name a few.\n\nCheck out my blog where I follow Dead chronologically starting at this year.\nwww.gratefuldeadlive3.blogspot.com",

How in the hell do we have a recording from 1968?\n\nthank you so much.\n\nif you see a blue and white '77 bus goin down the road, i'm probably jammin' out to this one, hiss and feedback and all.\n\nthe last track in the first set is super spectacular, thanks again!",

      "review_text": "First China Cat! First Eleven! First Born Cross Eyed! The Dead roll out a bunch of new material in this historically significant show. The new material is not as well formed as it became later, but it is well played.\n\nThe very first China Cat sounds like it it\u2019s in a lower key than on Aoxomoxoa and later, and Jerry's reaching for notes at the bottom of his range. It\u2019s a fast take, and Jerry's playing simply smokes throughout. \n\nWe then get a rare China Cat->Eleven transition, and it works well here. This is also the first time they played Eleven. Robert Hunter said that the lyrics of the second half of the Eleven were originally intended for China Cat, so it\u2019s interesting to hear the debuts done this way.\n\nThis is the earliest Dark Star here at Archive.org, a seed of what it would become. The Dead had only played live it twice before at the end of 1967. This version is up-tempo and short, much like the studio single (as in 45 rpm vinal) they released at this time. On the B-side was Born Cross Eyed, played here for the first time. A jamming New Potato precedes it, as on Anthem of the Sun. Cross Eyed slips in to Spanish Jam, which may also be the first time they played it. (It\u2019s the earliest here on Archive.)\n\nThe Other One is only a few months old here, and the lyrics are still evolving. It\u2019s a dynamite jam resolving into Little Schoolgirl, another rare transition. Pigpen is in top form on vocals and harp, back to the Dead\u2019s blues roots.\n\nThis is an exciting, historically notable show, but is not a great recording. The bass is muddled and the buzz is annoying at times, and there\u2019s a hiss. 1968 isn\u2019t exactly the dawn of the age of recording. Compare to the 1939 Benny Goodman live Carnegie Hall recording or to many of the 1966 Dead recordings.",

      "review_text": "vocals & lyrics come through crystal clear...... Jerry's & Bob's guitars come through loud and clear also. Keyboards are clear. Drums are low in the mix. Phil's bass comes through when I push in the loudness button and turn up the bass control on my amp, but its not very defined. There is that annoying buzz that is audible during quiet passages. There is an audible hiss. All in all a very listenable and I think good quality recording given how old it is, it sounds clear. I'm listening at medium volume through a decent 4 speaker system with a pair of tube amps. \n\nNote: the historical references that previous posters added to this show. Oldest live Dark Star on this site & first live China Cat, Born Cross Eyed & Eleven! Killer Spanish Jam too!",

The Spanish jam is beautiful, but the peak of the recording has to be the post other one cryptical jam into a hot GMLSG. Classic. Other One features the early draft lyrics.

The extended jam in the Eleven is no slouch, either.\n\nBut, as Cliff noted, the 16 minute Spanish Jam takes the cake...a definite candidate for the most amazing ever performed, the jam builds to some astonishing peaks. This is NOT a four!!",

      "review_text": "the lightning bolts of illumination shine quick I know this show well... perhaps its the dynamics of it. A great awakening, as what once slept now awakens. The movements are ALIVE, the Grateful Dead becoming anew as they fully become (and transcend) conciousness going beyond individual thought in the flying ways of pure progression... no drugs needed. The mind is already bent... full circle! Revolving around some deep inner truth released in fully achieved passion... '68 is capturing the sound in an unfathomable way. The depth of sound is, so much like beauty, a vast sea through which we are. Awash in the transcendent passion of a show such as this, you begin to grasp an idea the Dead never really portrayed but more so manifested... shining through the darkened stage is a light of pure noise. They arise from this and go in the myriad ways of beauty throughout '68. It is a quite amazing sound... this is where '68 begins. How could it really though? Its a year... irrelevant. Why define a moment when it shall pass? This show is a blur... a quickened movement, a glimpse of progression, the transcendence of beauty. When you pass through such a moment, you arise anew like the child of sound birthed by the Dead. It lived in fleeting moments. Its face was constant in its change... if you are to see what is represented in such a transtive moment look no further- the lightning bolts of illumination shine quick! The sky bursts into a quick scene of color on January 17, 1968. With unhindered passion as their feet, the music leads them onward into '68. Alas! The beginning of a year! It arose in '65, onward it grew",

But the playing more than makes up for the technical problems. A very good China -> Eleven, an outstanding Spanish Jam, alternate words on The Other One (too bad that they are so low in the mix), and a truly 5 star Schoolgirl.

The Dead at their raw, ragged and psychedelic best, working out the kinks in their newly hatched experiments. \nJust check out that Spanish Jam and more specifically the feedback at the end - just incredible.",

I notice that none of the copies of the 1968-01-17 show on the archive site are available to download though and I can't seem to find anywhere online that's offering these shows in downloadable format. Does anybody know where I can find this show for downloading? Thanks. ",
