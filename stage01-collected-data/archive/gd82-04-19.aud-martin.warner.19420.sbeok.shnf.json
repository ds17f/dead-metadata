I always prefer the audience tapes because they really capture the ambience of the whole show.  \n\nAnd what a show it was!\n\nI guess opinions about shows are always colored by our experiences, and this experience was incinerated in my brain.  :-)\n\nMe, Rustamon, Big Steve, and John K jumped in John K's old Buick and blasted up 95 to Baltimore from Raleighwood the day of the show.  No tickets, but it was not a problem getting in.\n\nThis show was the last on the tour.  Although the set list is not particularly notable other than the well known Raven space, this show rocked from start to finish.  Stranger was smokin, and the boys just did not let up for the rest of the set.\n\nEverything about it was memorable, the haul ass trip up, the seedy part of town where the venue was located.  The parking lot scene after the show was scary - people started lighting all these fireworks and Baltimore cops on huge horses just descended on us all.\n\nI was 18 but it seems like yesterday.  It was a dark night :-) in a dark place, a dark show, and man, I was riveted!!!\n\nAlthough the SBD is better reviewed, I suggest you download this version.  Either way, no collection  is complete without a copy of this spectacular show!\n\nR :-)",

I thought I was smart to tape over my cassette recording of this when I came across the soundboard version.  What a mistake.  It took me years to track down the audience version again.  There is so much warmth and life to this recording.  A stark contrast to the sterile flat soundboard.  This show is known for Phil's Raven space.  However, I love it for the entire show.  The first set is especially exceptional, including the my choice as the best-ever version of Jack Straw.",

      "review_text": "My-Oh-My.  Another Great Sounding April Audience! I'm really impressed with how many good April '82 audience shows are coming up on this site.  I've always liked 4.17 and 4.18 but, my-oh-my, April '82 is starting to rival some of the legendary periods we all highly-salami to.  Jack Straw starts things out strong with a good TLEO to follow.  And I LOVE the On The Road Again - Peggy'O - Cassidy troica.  Very nice.  Cumberland is superb (and only four done the whole year out of 61 shows...jeez.)\n\nI'm surprised at the labeling of this source at only \"AUD\" and not FOB?  Sure sounds like one to me.  Could anybody get a clarification on this?\nAnd really, could you get any wackier with that Raven Space?  As long as I rotate a few hundred shows and hear it maybe once ever few years or so for laughs.  That'd be fine.   This is a tough show to gage at giving a four or five star rating.  I wish Truckin' was a little more developed and exploratory.  Having Stella > R&R as an ending don't help much. The second started well enough but, The Boyz just didn't finish me off by putting a sonic stake through my heart.  This will have to be 4 1/2 I guess.  That's too bad since there was so much promise for \"stellardom\" with the first set and the beginning of the second.",

I was working on my fathers farm and it was hard work and my father to be blunt, was a dick, and not just because it was hes name. So that day i had had it and i gave him the quote from Maggies' farm  and packed my bags and my ticket and i was off. When i got there i was embraced by people that i knew and peple that i didint know.The love i got from the band and you folks was overwhelming so i said to myself that i was going to adopt these mother fuckers.The funny thing is that they let me in and i fealt like the luckiest man to in the world.  The 2nd famly you gave me was the greatest gift i will evere get in my life. you all saved me from a dark hole that i would not have gotin out of. Thank you and i dedicate this to my dear friend who is not with us now, Todd W.  aka Stone. I miss you and  i will see when i get up there one day.  Thanks for takeing the time to read my story.

IT WORKS PERFECTLY and they move into the best Terrapin of the tour on a big fluffy HASHISH cloud....\n\n\nthe rest of the set is all mandatory listening -- they were ON this night. check the Clugston SBD for the complete GOOD LOVIN. mostly i don't like the post PIGPEN version but bobby brings the tour to a very delightful end with his effort here -- i love every second.",

The harmonies have a wild synergy. Jerry\u2019s emphasis on California & angel has a unique rise that contrasts splendidly with Weir. Vocally this one is stunning, a personal favorite.

If it doesn't have the encore, here's one thing you'll miss:\nSo there I am in the upper section at the truly brokedown 'palace' that was the Baltimore Civic Center.  It's the end of the show, and I steal (I am SO SO Sorry!) a bedsheet with the Steal Your Face painted on it.  The sheet had been tied to the railing of the upper deck.  And I'm wearing this sheet like a cape and swaying back and forth, along with a dozen strangers, I mean lifelong friends.  We are all just swaying to the music while standing at the railing, and being as careful as we can considering the situation.  Then Bobby looked up at us (I mean, me) and said \"Be careful up there.\"  We went nuts.  On the way home, my sister and I grabbed a bus near Mt. Vernon.  Nobody onboard but a few deadheads, and one of em looks at me and yells \"HEY! I sold you pot!\"  And he had, too, several months earlier.  He's probably a doctor somewhere now..... \n\nThis was my second year of seeing the Dead, and maybe the best show I ever saw.  They Love Each Other, Peggy-O were great to hear.  It was a love-fest for a while, and then really rocked out on the Franklin/Estimated/Station  -- well, you know the rest.  GREAT show.  Fantastic time.  One of the most fun evenings of my entire life.  Thank you everyone!",
