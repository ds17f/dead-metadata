In The Grateful Dead Taping Compendium, Vol 3, John Dwork comments on the entire three-show run at Alpine in 1989, and lists the highlights of this particular show as \"...every damn note.\"\n\nTwo of the many notable hightlights:\n\n1) Not Fade Away. Usually a throw-away tune, this version sparkles. Raunchy, energetic, full of life. Jerry was bobbing back and forth while playing this, and during his second solo, bends a note so forcefully that he knocks his head back with his eyes closed, a shit-eating grin on his face. I was there, and I recall that plain as day. We all went \"Whew!\"\n\n2) The first And We Bid You Goodnight since the closing of Winterland (11 years). There was a momentary scream of joy from the audience when the first notes came out of Jerry's mouth, then everybody just as quickly shut up and enjoyed.\n\nThis show will rank as one of the best Grateful Dead concerts of all time.\n\nSean K.",

The first one was a nice, hot day, the rest of the time in rained and rained until after the 3rd night was over.\n\nDoes anyone remember the full moon over the back of the stage during 'Standing on the Moon' ?  I got a bit lost the second night and actually asked a policeman directions - I also asked him how many people the police were estimating that were present and he told me over 400,000!!!  The place only holds about 40,000 ...\n\nI was up by the tree on the first night - the only tree on the lawn.  The show really got going during 'It's All Over Now'.  Then it just got better and better.  Excellent 'Row Jimmy' as I remember!  Of course who could forget the 'We Bid you Goodnight'! That was a nice suprise ;-)\n\nAlso - nice first set closer - 'Music Never Stopped'.  Excellent 'China->Rider' too!.\n\nI'll never forget these shows and hold the first one in my memory very fondly.\n\nA long trip from PA but worth going and I highly recommend having a copy of this show with you wherever you go!",

For me some of the highlights include a tasty Row Jimmy (excellent vocals). a super jammin' phil-bomb droppin' TMNS, a high flyin' China/Rider, and great covers of It's All Over Now and Gimme Some Lovin'.   The sound quality is also EXCELLENT.  The vocals are crisp clear and out front and the instrumentation is well-balanced and fully audible.  This is not one of the those echo-plagued 80's shows or a show that suffers from the vocals being drowned out by the instruments.  This is a show that you will listen to alot.  Not only because of the great sound, but because of the performance and the nice set list.\n\nPeace.",

A second set that makes me up the volume, open a heineken, have a \"smoke\", boogie around, maybe piss off my neighbours - hee hee.\n\nLove the band, saw many shows, tortured many friends with my favourite bootlegs on cassette over the years.  But, with all due respect, damn they can't sing together.  One at a time - no problem at all.  I always wondered why they persisted in even \"trying\" to harmonize.  C'mon, we've all heard many a teeth-grinding UJB (although the one in this show is really good and intense).  \n\nPlayed Cumberland Blues from this show, thought my dog was going to start howling from the \"harmonies\".\n\nAnd this show is one of the better ones, in terms of singing.

The 1st set is solid but no way would it lead you to belive that the boys were going to pull off one of the best shows of the Decade. China- Rider is perfect and ends with an amazing solo by Garcia. Playin'is hot  with all the right acccentuations during the Bridge the jam is very jazzy and melts into a very clypso style Uncle Johns. During the final jam Weir and Brent lock into a powerful groove and Garcia goes with it. The Standing is very soulful and just fades out into the drums beautifuly. Post drumz is as good as it gets pure Rock and Roll. After the Wheel Brent stays on the Hammond the rest of the show he really Takes the show home. We Bid you Good Night is a great treat.

Obviously that's a subjective statement. I'd have to say that the GD planned the Warlocks shows as they happened since they had just banned camping in parking lots and wanted to get folks more excited about the music. On this night in Alpine Valley, they were just psyched to be there and simply destroyed. I would bet anything that the Bid You Goodnight was not planned at all, they knew they played the second set of a lifetime. This entire run is a breed apart.",

Hey, its the one from Fallout from the Phil Zone! You gotta love it when Brent hits that high note and sustains it over the rest of the band during the jam! Set two is a monster with the most intense China Rider I have heard from this period followed by a great SOTM. I love this song and the placement before Drums is pretty cool IMHO! Don't forget about the We Bid You Goodnite- the first since Winterlands closing according to Deadlists! \n\nSound is one thing I am very picky about with late 80/90's shows and this show delivers. If they got lazy they could release this as is; it sounds that good, just like you were there. Lots of color and crispiness! Everyone is nicely balanced unlike other SBDs I have come across from this era. \nThis is definately one to take with you to that \"desert island\" if you choose to go there- otherwise enjoy with some headphones or in the yard with close friends!

There is a way of getting these soundboards and starting a collection to cherish for the rest of your life. You can stream the soundboards directly through a Hi-fi VCR,Super VHS,Beta or Reel to reel, or better,DAT.There should be an Output on your hard-drive and of course an input on recording systems. There you have it. For those who dont know, VHS tape is suprisingly very good quality. It brings out the bottom end very well,plus alot of us allready have many of the boards allready on disc,I know for sure that Deadheads will desperatly seek out others fans disc's.

Sadly, near the end of Brent's life and ironically, he was playing perhaps as strong or better than he ever had. Brent's performance here equals anything Keith achieved in 1973. His organ work, in particular really shines here.\nEven if you're a hard core 70's fan, and I certainly am - you've simply got to include this show in your collection. The intensity in the playing is evident from the first song, and it's immediately clear the band is here to rock tonight. Stranger is well jammed, and then by the time they get to Cumberland and All Over Now, Jerry's just on fire. He delivers what was to be the last version of Push - too bad, because this one is so strong, Jerry sounds so comfortable and in the groove - as if it's the JGB band instead. The closer Music is just off the charts and guaranteed to curl your hair. Warning - heart patients should skip this song!!\nAs expected, Set Two is where they really show the crowd that by summer 89, the group had achieved a new peak in their career. The China>Rider opener is surprisingly fresh and inspired for such an old horse. The jams in Playin and UJB are a bit short, but magical and the ensemble playing is just so on target it's easy to forget it's live. SOTM - what can you say? Jerry's voice is fine and strong, a classic version for all time. When Jerry sings - \n\"A lovely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you\" - well if you don't get a lump in your throat check your pulse. The solo brings the house down and leads to Drums.\nNow - the Space. Each one of course is totally different, which is why I love them. This one remains one of my favorites of the late 80's. Never too harsh, yet inventive enough to not get boring. Only 7 minutes, but very mystical and introspective - a kalidoscope of different sounds and colors. Gets very weird near the end before blossoming into Wheel, with great spacy effects from Brent that just levitate you out of your chair.\nI'll leave you to discover the rest of the set on your own. Needless to say, they saved the biggest fireworks till last. How hard can they rock out NFA? This is it folks, the real 1989 in all its glory and a top show for the year.\nI have this SBD in a 128K MP3 version from you-know-where, and the sound quality is astounding - every bit as good to my ears as a SHN show. The other 2 nights are special as well, and I hope to review them soon. But this one holds the trophy. Find it, you gotta have!\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback",

I continue to listen to the DVD soundtrack though, which hacks the first set. 2nd set is classic stuff, but not as \"out there\" as Summer 1990 shows, which I think were even stronger. \n\nRegarding getting these SBD's still. Why use VHS when you can just stream the MP3 directly into your home CD Recorder (if you have one)! It's more work but you can mark your tracks and enjoy. But, MP3 is inferior to the SHN's or FLAC's by a wide margin. I have bought every monthly download at GD Merch so far for the best available sound.

But like Deer Creek, I honestly think these shows have been blown out of proportion over the years.  Cal Expo and Greek, just after these shows were at least as good, IMO, and many of the fall shows were better. \n\nThe scene: 88 was the dustbowl.  89 was the mudbowl.  I\u2019d skipped many of the east coast stadium shows, and then started my tour in earnest at Deer Creek (then here and then Tanner and I continued out west).  I remember PhC and Tanner were in the bus, but don\u2019t remember exactly who else was there (Sissy or was he in his own vehicle?).  In 88 it was Blackbird, this year it was Bid You Goodnight.  In this pre-Dark Star-break-out era, BYG was really something to celebrate \u2013 and celebrate we did.  \n\nThe music: why is it that when Brent starts swearing, the hairs on my neck stand up, and I know it\u2019s going to be a good show?  Everything in the first set is well played, but nothing crazy.  Is this one of the last, if not the last, Push/Shove?  Never one of my favorites, but not sure why they dropped it.  Brent trinkles the keys nicely on this one.  Music Never Stopped is the first sign that this show is going to be anything really above average, but near the end you can hear that Bobby and Jerry are not on the same page, with Bobby trying to bring the song to a close quite a while before Jerry wants to do so.  China>Rider is very good, but I\u2019m not sure why it gets quite the hype that others have given it.  Same goes for Playing.  I can think of at least 4 others from this year that are better and even the one from Laguna back in 88 (an underrated year, IMO) was better.  Then there is very little jam out of Uncle John\u2019s.  Really nice SOTM though, for sure.  Space through the end of the show is outstanding.  This is where I think the show really gets its reputation.  As I said above, the Bid You Goodnight was really amazing at the time.  I put it up there in my memory with the Landover Ripple from 88.  When they started tuning to play some else after, I remember some people calling out for a third set.  Ha.  Would\u2019ve been nice, though, eh?",

Alpine Dead shows were always special. Having had both seats on the lawn and seats in the pavillion, I can recall that the pavillion felt like a separate theater, it was shaped in such a nice little bowl, the sound was clean and LOUD in the seats. Obviously these shows just rocked, hard. The boys were happy and so were us Heads. It makes me sad to face the fact that in his later years, when Jerry was clean(er)and somewhat healthy, he still had that intensity and fire and virtuosity, but when he was too f*ck*d up he just couldn't put it all together. God rest his soul (Brent too,) those magnificent bastards. The next night, with the SugarMags sandwich in the 2nd set was even better, imho. I miss those days. At least we have the music.",

The best Built To Last- no midi trumpet effect on the solo!! Hands down the best SOTM ever played. Jerry rips your heart out with the outro solo. like i said high energy ALL THE WAY through the show, and VERY, VERY good singing by ALL the guys (yes even bobby).

July was the hottest month since '87 and the best until March '90. At tour's end, the Alpine run was the late-Brent era's hottest 3-day run, and this show is an '89 best. People talked about this show for a while and it was heavily traded: \n\"Dude how was the show last night?\"\n\"Pretty good\"\n\"Alpine good?\"\nOne reason is that the 1st set had a lot of rockers and another is the amount of carried-through energy in the second set fabric.\n\nAll but four songs from this show are on <b>Downhill from Here</b>. The first of these two (<i>Row Jimmy, Masterpiece</i>) aren't as important. <i>Push2Shove</i> however, was almost never pulled off like this. It's a definitive version and, what's weirder: the last! I saw something like 14 of these - none as good as this. The last of the four is <i>Music Never Stopped</i>, which is on <b>Phil Zone</b>; a song they killed consistently in '77, that had more drudged airings in the 80s, this is one that's just freaking nailed. It's good fortune that this show was captured during the infrequent complete-show vid tapings (but would be da kine if it were restored to a complete show).\n\n1st set. Solid right out the gate with <i>Good Times Roll</i> and a super strong <i>Built to Last</i> (they didn't play this enough at the time). Remember how you'd be standing with your buds pre-show and somebody would say \"this is the show where I get my <u>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</u>!\"? For many that was probably Dark Star, for me it was 'Bama, but I knew this cat that thought BTL was the E-ticket. He should've been there for this one . \n\n2nd Set. Likewise made of win. This is an 80s Top Ten <i>China>Rider</i>, and the energy and perfection are carried straight through <i>Playin'</i> (well, except for a Bobby flub) and into <i>UJB</i> like it takes no effort, building on the energy. Like the machine is switched on and they just ride along. The rest of the second set is average '89 until <i>GDtRFB</i>, which is as hyper as a '71 and perfect (aside from Bobby flub, natch). The high plateau continues through the encores (two the first night!).\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall: 4\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nGood Times Roll  \nBuilt to Last  - as good as it gets\nMe & My Uncle - pat\nWhen Push Comes to Shove - aced and put to bed\nThe Music Never Stopped - a ride\nChina Cat\nI Know You Rider - an 80s best\nPlaying in the Band -  6/29/76, 12/41/76, 2/3/78...and this one\nUncle John's Band - One of Brent's best\nGoin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad\nNot Fade Away\nAnd We Bid You Good Night  - has slight accompaniment\n\n17th - Most consistent overall - 4\u00bd stars\n18th - Variable, with the great 1st set streak and most interesting 2nd set - 3\u00bd stars\n19th - Best 1st set - 4 stars\n'89 Landmarks from this Run:\nChina>Rider - 17th\nFriend - 18th\nScarlet - 18th\nAlthea - 19th\n\nSOURCES: The 17702 source is just fine (the SBD has voices via some ambient bleed or board patch), though  <i>Good Times</i> and <i>GSL</i> have cut-outs on this upload. The Sokolow matrix is great.\n\n@dr flashback - Thanx for the great review. It's no surprise your MP3 sounds good. MP3 was designed in a German lab to be CD quality - identical to human ears. If it wasn't, they would have just gone with a different spec that was. People get it in their heads that it MUST BE inferior somehow, but blind tests repeatedly and consistently prove that you can't tell a difference from a (properly rendered) MP3 and the original source. Observing A/B tests for \"golden ears\" can be enlightening (especially those subjects claiming to hear a difference between 192k and 320k). Lossless is great for archiving - that's what it's for.",
