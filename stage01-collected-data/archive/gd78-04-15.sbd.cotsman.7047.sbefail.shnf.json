While everyone showed up for this one, Jerry in particular is white hot from the first chords and it just keeps getting more and more amazing as the show unfolds.\n\nThe 'Let It Grow' toward the end of the first set is one of the most amazing things my ears have ever sent to my brain.  How this one could have ever been written or performed by human beings after serious rehearsal, let alone the highly improvised work of genius it was, simply defeats rational thought.  BRAVO!!",

      "review_text": "Let It Grow and...Morning Dew! At 3:29 or so, Garcia lets out a ferocious warble..  He lets another good one fly at 11:50ish.  Fairly crisp sound.  In Deal, Garcia starts off with a solo so low key, you figure he might pack it in after one time thru.  His next one starts uniquely in the very low register.  The singing at the end is spirited; Garcia tries to improvise, and Donna does, too, here and there.    \n\nVery interesting Morning Dew.  The only one in 1978, it sounds like no other.  Garcia's first solo is exciting.  After an extended scalar run, he suddenly trills the chords, something he usually saves for the end.  They seem a bit uncertain how to bring it back to the verse, so they just basically stop, dead.  Out of this complete silence, Garcia begins to sing.  At the seven minute mark they start the quiet part, leading to the expected crescendo.  Probably not among your top five or ten versions, but great fun.    \n\n[the rhythm in Brown Eyed starts all screwed up, as if half the drummers are trying to give it a reggae beat; they don't pick up the straight ahead 4/4 beat until they sing the first chorus, and then, lose it again when they get back to the next verse!  Bizarre.  Garcia's solo here starts all off balance; you start to wonder what tune they are playing. Passenger is also troubled; Garcia butchers the ending of his first solo. On A&A he starts strong; but once they make the jump to warp speed, he quickly runs out of gas.  So, despite some clear high points, this really might be only an average performance on balance].",

The mentioned Brown Eyed Women in particular is tough to endure.  But the rewards are a fine 1/2 Step, Let It Grow, & Morning Dew.

      "review_text": "A History Lesson One of the best shows ever.  No; really.  Here's why:\n\nThe show was held at William & Mary College in Williamsburgh, VA. If you've never been, Williamsburgh is a restored colonial town for the tourists -- everywhere you look is ye olde candle maker and the town crier.  This was before the insane mid-80s outburst of MTV Deadheads, but even so, the Deadheads took over the town in our own friendly way.  Walk in to ye olde ice cream parlor, and there are Deadheads helping the counter help apply extra whipped cream to sundaes, and discreetly breaking up mushrooms in to their milkshakes.\n\nTo add to the adventure, it turns out that besides being income tax day (April 15) it was also parent visitation day at William & Mary.\n\nA beatiful crisp spring day as the sun went down.  Suddenly someone appeared in the parking lot with a large bag of rather gigantic blotters for sale at very low prices.  The rumor was always that the band was connected in some way to this.  Who knows?\n\nInside, the stage was VERY low to the floor -- maybe a foot off the ground, making for a very intimate setting. The ushers were all college students, and it was refreshing to see that no matter how wasted we were, they were more wasted.  John Scher, the east-coast's answer to Bill Graham tried to get us to calm down and move back from the speaker towers, while spaced out ushers tried to whip us up in to a frenzy with their flashlights.\n\nThose who could still talk when the second set started saw Billy and Mickey come out and start swinging their arms back and forth and spinning on their stools before the show even started -- like two wrestlers getting ready to grapple.\n\nThe rest of the show speaks for itself in a dozen crackling ways, especialy the Morning Dew.  When they played Around and Around, we really DID believe that they would \"never stop rocking\" -- they're going to play all night!\n\nWell, no not exactly.  I DO miss the One More Saturday Night encore on this tape.  The band came out and Bobby said, \"Guess what night it is?\" and our busy little minds scrambled...\"Uh... New Years?  Halloween?  Someone's birthday?\"  No, it's SATURDAY NIGHT.  Whee!\n\nNo room here to tell you how after the show with our faces painted day-glo we wound up at Camp Perry Marine Base instead of our campground.  (Camp Perry also being a CIA training center).  The nice guard with his nice shiney boots and nice rifle showed remarkable restraint, and pointed us toward our campground.\n\nOK? OK.\n\nGlen",

Since that time I've always looked for other versions, especially from the 77-78 period which might compare.  Another reviewer mentioned the version from Broome County 11/7/77 which is indeed a mighty fine version.  The famed Boston show 5/7/77 is another fantastic version.  Recently, I got my hands on the Englishtown 9/3/77 which has been released as Dicks Picks 15.  If I had to pick a definitive version of  Half-Step it would be the Englishtown show.  Its just tremendous.  Yet, like I said this version is really amazing.  The final jam is so heavy with Jerry and Keith flying together accented by the drummers into super tight locomotive finish.",

Having said that, it's the best among those I've heard. Garcia's guitar notes shine, his voice is a little better than average. I could do without \"If I had the world to give,\" but for the most part, quite good.\n\nSome of the other reviews mentioned what a shock to Williamsburg this show was. My friends and I stayed in a campground, and didn't sleep at all (wonder why?) I think we were happy purchasers of that gray blotter another reviewer mentioned. Anyway, in the morning about seven of us thought we'd go to Howard Johnson's for breakfast. We were wearing our best Dead/camping clothes, and smelled like wood smoke. Who knew that HoJo's was the after-church hangout for the town's finest elderly citizens? \n\nIt got noticably quieter, and all the heads turned our way as we came in. I guess the freak show was already the only thing they were talking about that morning. We were seated way in the back, near the smell of disinfectant, and then never waited on. We left through the back door while one of our friends was still in the restroom.",

      "review_text": "excellent 78 This show aint perfect, but it's better than some of the negitive comments given, that's for sure, and stands up on it's own.\n  After all, this is 1978, everyone is down on the year, that it's easy to over look the hidden gems. and this period is before they started to open up to the shakedown material in the fall and winter, so it can be heard as the inferior late 77 tour. But really, keith is still active, even if he's more delicate and hallow.\n   The Brown eyed women is not a choice cut, but it's not as bad as many would have you belive, it's just falling victom to some loose playing at the time. The Mississipi is not as great as some would lead you to belive, but certainly worht hearing. broome county and the boston garden half steps are okay, so too is the winterland from june, but half steps are king in 73-74, dp1, kezar, march in buffalo....\n  The real meat of this show is the Playin' ITB which is great all 77 and into 78, where as the dark stars to follow and the other ones are lacking enginuity, the PITB is still fresh and thought provoking, now used to get somewhere other than donna's loud screach.  \n   Let It Grow is equally hot, first picked up again in October 77, from 76, there's a lot of life in the exit jam.\n    And the Only Dew in 1978, sure not a 72-74 dew, but as people love  barton hall for it's simliarity to the one drumber dew era, this dew sould be liked along similar lines, with a hint of jerry's reinvented strings. The only caution in 1971 fromj 3/18 casts that show as a gem, maybe not for the entire performance, but for a unique portion found in it.

I really appreciate the setting, as it makes the listening experience that much more tinglingly intense. I found this show as i hunt for the greatest 1/2 step ever... this one is really good, but not quite as rollicking as I would like. Hey did anyone else notice the buzzing sound starting during good lovin? Could it be something on the bass.. thats what I'm guessing. The Bertha was really quite nice and extra smooth, passenger has akward with a guitar scream as donna tries to wail- bizarre. I think the best moment is when Donna lets a scream duing good lovin and the song goes from dull to exciting.. you hear the crowd start to pick up on the energy about 30 secs later and the band starts the engine ack up. I think this Dew is top notch... not too haunting, but well played and nice drumming. I might venture its really about as good as Stanley theater 72-> pretty close for this later year. Lastly Candy man is trippy as I lost what song it even was for a few confused glorious moments. Cheers!",

      "review_text": "The Misfortune Of Coinciding With Parents Day... Saturday morning, 8AM. Bill Whitbeck and his date Meredith picked me up and we began partying. Drove from Norfolk,Va., to \"CW\" (Colonial Williamsburg) in his tan Ford Pinto, and when we arrived about 9-ish the parking lot was already half-full of die-hard NY, NJ, PA, New England and fans from all over. It was one big pre-show party. My stick-man, Bill, had attended W&M, graduating in '76 and knew lots of folks there, many whom I'd met over the years. We hooked up with Steve Wilkerson, Jim Puckett, Tom Puckett (No relation to Jim, just good friends). We were drinking some \"cold ones\" and toking off of a bong, right there in what the students call \"The Drunken Gardens\" (Sunken Gardens, according to the College), when I happened to notice that amid the assembled multitude of tie-dyed Freaks (My People!) there were an awful lot of students and their parents really dressed up, like Sunday-Go-To-Meeting clothes, suits, ties, formal dresses, etc. Well, needless to say, the entire DeadHead community \"Threw Down\" all day long, and twelve hours later when the show started, I was about ready to call it a night. When the band hit the stage the crowd erupted into pandemonium. The band picked up on the energy of the legion of fans and Tore The Roof Off The Sucker, to coin a phrase. Somewhere on the internet is a photo of Bill, Jim, and Tom(Puckett), which shows them standing pre-show talking to Bill. Jim is the one in the beautiful \"Skull and Roses\" Levi jacket, the emblem he created himself, multi-talented guy that he is, a regular Renaissance Man himself. (I was standing next to Tom Puckett, to the left, but am sure I was cut out of the photo since I was wearing a brown t-shirt with Zappa's face screen printed on the back! (Heh, heh) Well, long story short, the parents HIGHLY OBJECTED to the fact that the campus (established 1692 by King William and Queen Mary), and thought to be a bastion of conservatism,  was \"littered\" with a legion of Hippy Freaks. Hence, no more Grateful Dead shows at the Hall. What a shame, it was the best place to \"Have a big party with a band playing.\" Next year they played the Hampton Coliseum, which was at first a letdown (to me) after the relative freedom of the hall. For cryin' out loud,at the Hall, security was the campus police! Hey Now! Paisley Tom reporting",

Listen to each Jerry solo, it is incredible. If anyone has found a version where he screams \"ON MY WAY!!!\" like this one, i'd be grateful, because i've never heard it. This ten minutes is just one of my favorite dead moments I've listened to. What an amazing song it is. Truly.",

Funny story. He split and went to the show. Great morning dew btw...read that two or three brothers died in a car wreck on the way to this show. First morning dew in the better part of a year.",

Brent was a great keyboardist and vocalist for many years. Sometimes Donna's howling was almost embarrassing. \n\n1978 was a good year. But then they were all good years. Even some great shows in the '90s. They're all mostly 5 star shows to me and other real deadheads.  ",
