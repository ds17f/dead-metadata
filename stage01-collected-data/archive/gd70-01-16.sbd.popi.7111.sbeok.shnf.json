It seems like the band is just starting to gel about this point.  \nThe Dancin' is relatively short but good.  Some Head in the audience yells out \"Alligator\" and the boys kick it off right on que.  That guy must have been ecstatic.  The 11 jam isn't as intense as it could sometimes get but it's real nice and Jerry sounds great in DDHNM.\nIt's really too bad the Cumberland beginning is cut.  This is a great version, the band is really in sync and chugging along when the end gets cut too. Damn! The outro jam was probably great. \nA good Easy Wind and a relatively short Other One but good Drums and a decent jam. (The drummers sound great in this show)\nA nice Cosmic Charlie but it too gets cut in the second to last chorus of \"Go On Home, Your Mama's Calling You\" and comes back in the final chorus.  Good version though.\nI'd give this show 4 STARS if it wasn't for the cut's.  The sound quality is damn good, so it's definately worth having. \nI wish all the 1970 shows sounded like this.",

I'm going to concern myself with a very select portion of this one.\n\nIf you don't decide to download this whole show, you should grab at least the Alligator > Drums > 11 > Death Don't.  Pig's pretty off-key in the Gator.  Drums > 11 features a real nice transition to the different time signature.  Jerry really is on top of the whole tension-release jams in this 11 and sings the hell out of Death Don't.\n\nI've always thought that Alligator would've been a great additon to the mid-80's dead.

To anyone belonging to the digital age, you have my sympathy. You know nothing of joy. This is not your fault, it's a circumstance of your age. But finding a decent tape back in the analog trading days was a thing of joy, celebration. And this is one of those shows.\n\nRating a show is subjective, but here's my rating: it sounds like a bootleg. If you don't want anything like that, move on. If you listen to phish, for god's sake find something else. The Grateful Dead are not for you. Find a pleasant, inoffensive band like dave matthews or spend lots of time in elevators.\n\nIf on the other hand you are truly adventurous at heart, stream this show. Listen and decide for yourself. Then download it and keep it.\n\nHear something that was recorded in a time not intended for you (or me). Yet it persists. Remember that in 20 or 30 years when phish & dave matthews are answers in the last version of Trivial Pursuit, true music lovers will still listen to Miles, Coltrane, Hendrix, The Grateful Dead and the like.",

The reason I bothered to read the most recent review was because of the date of the show, which I thought was the second edition of the Dead's Download Series. I wondered why this show (thinking what I thought) was still available here (not a complaint if it were the situation I thought it was). I thought of my gripes that the entire Albany '90 run is not available because of 6-10 songs from the other nights being part of Dozin', when other shows that are for sale can still be found on here. Then I went to compare what was available for sale-download and noticed the discrepancy in the dates, and discovered that they're two different shows!\nUncle Meat raises a good point about the trading era of yesteryear. Blank CD's and postage may still exist in some parts of this land, but trading circles and trees are now history. A building block of a community is no longer available at a time when it seems it's needed most. I got plenty of fulfillment from learning how to download these shows, but that can become mundane rather quick if you're like me and intend to pillage as much from this site as possible before it's all for-sale-only.\nI believe this show was among my first dozen to 20 tapes. Summer of 1989. Wow, I'm old. It was crackling with intensity back then, and this source is probably a X 20 upgrade from the tape I had back then. It might still be floating around somewhere in my mom's house. This should have been the remastered and released show, but I imagine that will come in time as well.\nIT'S FREE NOW!!! Get it while you can. You won't regret it.\nWhere's the convergence? Attention Deficit Disorder converged on me in a train wreck of statistics, philosophy, and sentiment.

Some pops,glitches,cuts etc, like an old photo where the edges have worn, but the image is still VERY MUCH all there..\nThis is a memorable recording for me, it was my 1st \"bootleg tape\" as they were reffered to then. Even though taping was allowed, and to have these tapes was perfectly legal and Ok by the dead, everyone still called them bootlegs. My 1st live tape,cam from a friend of a friend who was Deadhead and I had heard he had some live Dead tapes. I begged my friend  to hook me up. Eventually, probably weeks later, there was this cassette on my kitchen table. Springers 1970,I was like a kid at christmas when that tape came!! I Started listening and I was kind of dissapointed because the sound during the begining was rough and the mix was all screwed up, but I kept on keeping on with it..  Glad I did, Black Peter & High Time grew on me from this tape, but the big fun was Alligator>Eleven whew, I use to rewind and listen to that over and over!!Another story about this tape, a group of guys inour early 20's were ata lakeside cabin for a getaway weekend, I brought a bunch of doses and we all indulged for the weekend. being the only deadhead, there wasn't much Dead being listened too that weekend. How ever on the car ride home sunday moring, still all of us a little high and very tired, I popped this Springers 1970 tape in and for the next 90 mins. no one spoke a word and this tape bubbled and slid along as we ate up this miles on the road. When the tape ended my NON-DeadHeads friends were \"Like wow\" that was perfect road music, thats a great tape!! So I felt that was a fairly strong testimonial! Non- deahHeads who had a head full of acid over the weekend soaked that music up like kittens drinking milk! ....ahh, the crazy old days!! haha\nWhat an age we live in now, music at our fingertips....no more waiting for the whim of someone who had and overblown ego and the tapes you were seeking, no more trading through the mail and waiting weeks.. Anyhow, I'm so glad this music is still out there and so many people still stoke the fires of passion for this music!!! I thank all of you for your efforts in archiving all of this, I only wish I knew how to get this streaming onto a disc so I can listen in the car!!!",

In the old days, it be hell or high water before I got a decent copy of this show. And this is a fairly decent copy for being 35+ years old. Song selection is very nice and played well.

Analog sound isn't lost or gone forever, though. People I trade with often use analog modeling systems on digital platforms (Izotope Ozone, for instance). They tweak the sound with tube filters & valve equalizers and then they store the music in digital format, which is where digital makes the most sense (no wear & tear, warping, etc.) \n\nbtw uncle meatball, i happen to like phish.

Trading analog out of the back of Relix mag through the snail mail was, in retrospect, was like leaving cave paintings of the epic hunt.  It served to chronical the event, but was not available to a widespread and broad range of listeners.  A bit of the beauty back then, was receiving a brilliant show in the mail, and then springing it on your friends during a party, or out of the blue on a road trip.  It could always make up for that time you (insert red-eyed hazy blunder here).\nI appreciate the reviews, the hints, the words from some of the even earlier reel to reel guys out there, and from the later day digital \"tapers\".  I continue to record shows, trade shows, and mixdown matrix recordings, some 25 years later, and have met a handful of you out there.  You are family, and you are my brothers and sisters caught in the slipstream that still is, live dead.\nForgive me however, if I skip through the rants and bitch sessions that I am (argh) more frequently finding here.  I am not into that, nor do I find it a very valuable way for archive to dedicate storage space on thier non-profit servers.

In a way I see this as the Dead surviving in yet another way. Cheers to those who put in their good word(s). This show is a great raw selection of early era drums. The jams are packed and some of the sound falls of the charts. I like this, cause in years to come the sound sorta hits that infinite plane where it all sits due to the sheer volume of time the band has spent on the stage. Still though, Jerry does some pretty rad Allman style riffing. I like this time right before the wall of sound where you can hear that they are really straining to do the most they can with the equipment they have. Perhaps this touches on some of the sentiment for the tubular days of analog!?! They are ready to break the sound open and really get into space with the sound. This is like a new pair of shoes as far as I am concerned... a really nice pair of shoes. Just not the holy years worth of wear yet.

I never contacted anyone from magazines because I didn't know about all that stuff. Later when the internet started up I used to find lists and tapers in my area, call them and arrange a meeting. I got the bulk of my collection from a guy in Marietta, GA who I sadly lost touch with, but who was an amazing friend to let me come with a box and take about 20 tapes at a time, even though I was unable to give him much of anything. We did drive over to Alabama for a Ratdog show (I think the first tour after Garcia died). I used to look at the lists of the traders with the biggests list, and just marvel at all the wonderful shows they had (Jeff Tiedrich's list was my bible), knowing that I couldn't even begin to trade with these guys because I likely just had the more popular shows. Well, I can tell you how glad and grateful I was to find the IA and see all those shows that I wouldn't have been able to hear. I imagined what these shows must have been like for years and years, and now thanks to the digital age, I can finally hear them. For some reason, I remember something on Jeff's list: Cafe Au Go Go in 1967 and 1969. I read somewhere that the Dead were running through some songs during the day and that Zappa came from upstairs and complained that they were too loud. Not sure if that's apocryphal or not. A lot of Deadheads I know were turned on by tapes. Even those going to shows in the 70's and 80's, so there's nothing wrong with discovering the boys here on the internet. I'm sure a lot of things about the 60's were \"had to be there\" but I don't think Dead music suffers from not having been there. I remember some amazing shows though I can't really remember what the band played. I just remember a feeling of \"wow, this is amazing\" and maybe an image or two. Certainly I can't say to anyone, \"you weren't there, so you don't get it and won't ever.\" Enjoy everything on offer here. Check them all out, the good and the bad.

Hat's off!  \n\nI just sent my old buddy on the other coast a late-night text message (listen and you'll do the same thing) that read:\n\n\"Ok, don't f--- around.\n1/16/70 at Springer's Inn\nat Portland has got \nprobably the best Dire Wolf\never- there's like twenty\npeople in a pub in January\nin Portland and a fireplace\n-bobby talks about the \n\"relative sub-dominant\"\nthen uncle johns. Ok?\nSmith- the deeper into the \nmines we go, the more \njems we find.  Goddamn!\nwill I declare!\"  \n\n\nFriends, this is a show. This is a show you might have as your soundtrack if you lived in some 'Lord of the Rings' world.  Like if you were on a quest that took you through stinking, crowded, cobblestone markets, through endless dark forests, over high cold snow mountain passes and cast upon stormy seas.  In these chapters of the journey there's not any elves or goblins, princesses or fairies- just the gruel of the road, the sweat of the horse, a tankard of ale at Springer's Inn.  The salt of the Earth.  Dig it?  \"...Every leaf was turning/to watch him die...\"  \n\nTake a broad look at the reviews here- they span over ten years.  Take a little bit deeper of a look- almost every year, on January 16, folks gather and write a review--Because there is ONLY SHOW on this day in the Archives>>> and that means this show, this campfire, this tavern round table, is strong magic.  This here is some way station along the road to unlimited devotion.  There's some really unique combinations at this show- like Easy Wind>>Cryptical and the bridges and little solos/riffs in the songs are just a little bit... different, it's a different key this night and I'm not necessarily talking musically, but skeleton-y.  \n\n\"Go home, your mama's calling you...\"\n\nMy buddy wrote back:\n\n\"Beyond the wishes of my\nwife.  I hope I never grow\nout of the grateful dead.  It \nseems to just get better & \neverything else gets \nworse!  I love my wife, my\nchildren, and my dead!\nCouldn't give a shit about \nanything else!\"",

This is not reason to be happy or sad I'm just commenting that my wife is gone, my child are eighteen and sixteen and they will be leaving me soon but the Grateful Dead just kept on spinning on my tube jive amp of yesteryear either at Springer's Inn or MSG or The Frost  or at the Capital Theater in Passaic, New Jersey. Wherever there is electricity and human will the Grateful Dead will live. The reason: they did so we can!",

      "review_text": "A standout performance Though lacking the great Dark Star of the following night, this is probably the better of the two Portland shows, and one of the best of Jan. 70. \n\nIn particular, The Good Lovin, Dancin, and DDHNM are all well played, but the highight of the set may be the Eleven jam following Alligator>Drums. This version is just flat out awesome, and very unique: Weir is higher than usual in the mix, allowing the rhythm section to stand out a bit more. Though somewhat ragged, it has a really interesting, dynamic, almost swinging/jazzy vibe compared to most other Elevens, and the jamming itself is white hot.\n\nAnd speaking of white hot, the Other One suite from this show is a real barn burner!",

      "review_text": "Chicken farm <br />This show was actually at Springers Ballroom, which was outside the metro area, south of Gresham, Oregon. People called it the chicken farm, because that's what the warehouse had recently been (and after a performance space, a weekend  flea market until it burned down in '87). Either it sold out or close because the band returned two days later (after a show at OSU) for a word-of-mouth show. This night is notable mainly for the Easy Wind, but sources are colored by erratic pitch problems, making it impossible to enjoy without pitch correction. The pitch change between Cumberland and M&MU indicates there were two sources at one point, and possibly a missing song here (perhaps a Big Boss Man). Either way we have 1h50mins of one of TC's final shows.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Casey Jones</i> is marred by PA problems but is otherwise a standard start. Things finally gel with <i>China>Rider</i>, where Phil shines (most boots from this era are completely missing the bass frequencies). <i>Good Lovin'</i> isn't the best set-ender, but they make up for it with the version the next night in Corvallis.\n\nSecond Set.<i> Dancing in the Street</i> appears to be the start of a new set (a single, long set is not atypical for this period). It's a sour version with the drummers out of sync. Coming out of <i>Drums</i>, Jer doodles straight in to a <i>The Eleven</i> and the rest pick it up, catching some fire without resolving to the verses. It seems unlikely (though cool) to dissolve into <i>Death Don't Have No Mercy</i>. The drummers are still all over the place for <i>Cumberland Blues</i>. Jer played the fills on <i>Me & My Uncle</i> differently in early '70 and even then this isn't the usual. <i>Dire Wolf</i> is a sweet and embryonic version, nailed (though there are better examples from early '70). They hadn't found the starting chords yet for <i>Uncle John's</i> and nobody plays tight here (even with help from Mickey's gong), nor is anyone harmonizing on the same lyrics at the same time. Write it off as a work in progress (and see instead later in the year). Then the show erupts with a landmark <i>Easy Wind</i> and, as others have pointed out, the <i>Cryptical>Other One</i> is likewise a smoker.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 2\u00bd Stars\n\nHighlights:\nEasy Wind \u2013 the one that put the show on the map\nThe Other One Suite \u2013 one of the year's best, w/great Crypticals\n\nSOURCES: All sources have severe pitch problems, running helium fast (a whole key in places) to way too slow, as well as balance issues. The popi_7111 is preferable as the droncit-restore-7111 has EQ that makes it ringy (it's not compression tinny). Casey Jones is Mickey Mouse fast, <u>needing -4.5% pitch correction</u>. Mama Tried <u>needs -3.5% correction</u>.  From Black Peter, the rest of the 1st set <u>needs -3%</u>. The 2nd set <u>needs -2%</u> until M&MU, which is slow and <u>needs +1%</u>. The next two <u>need +2%</u>, and from Easy Wind on <u>needs +1%</u>. The 140967_sbd_lubar has the same pitch errors for the first set, worse pitch errors for the second set, mislabeled tracks, and is missing half of the second set. A corrected Easy Wind is a bonus track on <b>Workingman's</b> \n\negeff \u2013 a couple people shout out for Morning Dew, Bobby/Phil say no, but they're playing UJB, which is musically similar (they're joking)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1/18/70\nAfter a good turnout, they returned two nights later for a better show. However, with no promotion there was a thin turnout. This was the Dead, so that's not why they played a short show. Rather, a reel went missing long ago. The source is <b>Download #2</b>, which needs the channels switched through Dancing. We have 1hr20min [tunings were cut for a single CD], lacking an opener or two (remarks opening CR&S suggest they were already a couple songs in), and from the missing reel a M&MU plus whatever else. Since they played Dancing, Good Lovin' and Love Light, it's less likely a missing TOO or Dark Star and more likely a couple/few from Workingman's<b>:</b> High Time, Casey J or Dire Wolf. Given the channels switch, one reel must be a generation down. \n\nThe first few are a bit rickety, especially <i>Mason's</i>. Note Bobby, \"You're probably wondering why we have so few of you here tonight\". Someone (sounds like Mickey),  \"It's a hippie death cult!\". Little of the <i>Dancing</i> jam is inspiring. When the tape runs out @11:31, the OFF switches to 12/31/69. Bobby mentions the curfew, but is then told they still have 35mins. <i>Good Lovin'</i> is where the show perks; the jam is basic but fine. The <i>China Cat>Rider</i> is what you came for. It's terrific, and note at the start of the jam into Rider, how much Jer lets Bobby take the lead [starting @3:15]. During <i>Love Light</i>, Pig tells Jer \"Okay Mother McCree!\". It has brief sparks, but when the tape runs out @17:50, the OFF switches to 1/2/70.\nShow = 2\u2154 stars",
