Terrific setlist including Mission in the Rain and Might as Well, giving it '76 context.\n\nThe songs melt, and I'd go so far as to say this is a top 5 of all time show.\n\nThe highlight is Row Jimmy, during Jerry's second lead exploration (4:00-6:00).  He turns his pedal steel into a pure extension of his soul.  His ability to communicate directly from his creative internal energy is crystallized in this musical dialogue.  I have no doubt this is the best Row Jimmy the Dead have ever played.  Hands Down!",

Crisp 5 star sound is the least of this review.  The band was simply tapped into a deeper rhythm of life in this era which comes through in this show like few others do in any time era of Grateful Dead Productions.

Don't get me wrong, I realize that there were better years (' 72,' 73, and ' 77 for example), but there is ample evidence to make a case for the Bicentennial as a great Dead Year. For example, 1976 had a laid-back funky groove that is quite unlike the sound from any other period in the band's history. The set lists from ' 76 are not known for song diversity; due to the boys relearning the material and the reintegration of Mickey Hart into the band, but there were some extremely interesting song pairings and combinations that were also unique to the period, and the songs they did play were pretty hot. Killer new material (Help>Slip>Franklin's, Lazy Lightning>supplication,etc.). Killer old school songs (St. Stephen, Cosmic Charlie) dusted off and freshly arranged. Plus one or two great songs that only played a few times (Mission in the Rain). Furthurmore, the soundboards from the period are so crispy and have great clarity, with Keith's piano and Bobby's guitar more prominant in the mix than at any other time in the band's history (a good thing). Phil's bass sounds so good and his playing is so...slippery! That's the best word I can come up with to describe it. And last but not least, Jerry! So soulful, so clear and focused, and funky as hell! Singing great as well.\n   Enough of my preaching about the virtues of DEAD YEAR 1976, the reason I chose this show is because I figured if I was going to rant in such a manner I 'd better have the goods to back it up. A great show and an incredible soundboard. Such a kind groove throughout. This and a few other shows (6/9,7/18,9/25,10/9,10/10,10/15,12/31) are the best of the year, and what a year!\n   This was my first review and was something I have been needing to get off my chest for a hot minute. In the future I will try to focus more on the particulars of the show itself rather than using the show, as a whole , to prove a point or as an example of some grandiose ideal. Anyway, this really is a great show... many highlights(Mission...,Row Jimmy,etc.)too many to mention...worthy download...I was four in ' 76...I will shut up now.  Namaste!",

Listen to those if nothing else. \n\nWith this show and others from this year, the last songs are not throw-aways. This One More Saturday Night is musical, the vocals are right on, Jerry and Keith are as tight with the band as in any song of the night.\n\nIf you like this one, you'll also like the 6/27 show. It's an audience recording-- a good one, though the sound is not as good as this. But I think that show is even better than this one. \n\nIf you're not familiar with the 1976 sound, listen these two shows at least twice each. You'll gain an appreciation for yet another unique-sounding and top-notch Grateful Dead era.",

Thankfully this was not the last peggy-o of the sweet 70's but this is one of the best for sure.  Really love the Cassidy  and Candyman too, Keith was on. Jerry and Keith Unite!",

As if rediscovering the love the band feels for its music and playing with each other, you can actually hear how Jer and the gang cherish each note.  Nothing wasted, precise, sweet.  Jer's voice sounds sweet.  I think you can really start to hear how rejuvinated the band is in this period after the hiatus, the long studio/rehersal stint for the Blues for Allah album then the start of full force touring again. You can hear them smiling. They love it.  Wish I had been there.  So much excitement despite the layed back tempo.  Set 1 is brilliant for a nice easy Sunday morning of kicking back.  Mission is the sweet icing on the cake.  You can't go wrong.  Download now.",

So mellow, in fact, that Donna gives an orgasmic \"ohh\" during the chorus at the end of the show...priceless!  Classic '76 show with excellent sound quality.",

She is simply beautiful.\n\nSpeaking of Donna, she is starting to sing better, admittedly her wails from 72-74 did distract from songs.  She gets really good in 77 and 78, then tails off in 79 from doing too much pot and coke.\n\nShe is still beautiful and I'm so happy she was a member of the dead for almost a decade.",

The playin' that surrounds it is surreal.\n\nThis show has one of those bone chillingly amazing feels. No flubs, all buisness.\n\nMission in the Rain is simply the best live version found here. Jerry, Donna and Bobby sing it more beautifully than any other rendition of JGB, allthough those are good as well. \n\nEvery single song has on and Keith is not wasted and is playing beautifully. How this full show went under the radar of Lavata's collection or the download series i'll never know.\n\nGrateful to own this SBD, anyone want it?\ndylan.muhlberg@colorado.edu",

Lets get some perspective and save the 5 stars for when the band is ON and tight and inspired.\n\nSound quality is great tho, with keith maybe a bit too loud.",

Recording levels are perfect.  Great show to boot. Tenn Jed starts  off with a nice mellow groove and it gets better from there. Someone on here once said \"this site is like mining for gold\". I totally agree. With all the different phases of the Dead, when you find a \"nugget\" that you love is such a great feeling. My favorite shows may not be your favorites, but we can all agree there is gold in here for sure",

Its very difficult to capture the magic in a tape or any recorded show unless you actually were there and experienced it first hand, which I\"m grateful I have! But my point here is, this show right here, captures the magic. I can feel it unlike any other show I've heard where I wasn't actually there. There is so. much. feeling. in this. Period. Love it.",

Auditorium Theater was a great venue, I had never seem an amplifier set like the wall of sound, I had never heard music live or otherwise that touched what Jerry and the boys played that night. The only fly in the ointment was a crew of extremely aggressive ushers that were determined to snuff out any pot smoking. Luckily about the third time they accosted us the guy next to me let the guy have it with a high end camera flash right in his face. That was the last we saw of him. ",
