The sound isn't as good as this set 2, but the I think the playing and sound are superior to that of the 9th's set 1. If you care, Cassidy, Candyman, L.L >Supp., Might As Well, Samson, and Cosmic Charlie fill out an 80 min. CD. The C.C. is a separate song, and doesn't flow into Let It Grow.",

Yes, the first set has sound quality issues, but this is STILL my favorite show.  They sound SO tight and the music just flows.  Don't understand one poster's comments about Dancin' being sloppy - it is the BEST one IMHO.  St. Stephen, Eyes HOT HOT HOT!  I also love the tightness of Lazy Lightning/Supplication - again the best versions so far I have heard.  They are so in synch and Jerry is on fire - it sounds so beautiful with a nice full sound.  I always wondered why some deadheads are so down on 1976.  This one and the Beacon show are so incredibly played I have ranked them both in my top FIVE.  Of course, all of these reviews are just opinions and everyone has one but I urge you not to miss this show (even if it is just disc 2 and 3).",

He is really responding well to Phil and Jerry and is playing very free, well phrased riffs with a LOT of energy. This is what is so great about the dead sound in the late 70's.  Everything is real balanced and you get a sense of how the band is reacting to each other in these jams.

Why?  Because I have NEVER heard a St. Stephen or Eyes played like they did at this show.  There is an effortless grace combined with a monstrous, yet gentle power pervading the band here, especially Jerry and Phil.  Phil drops some of the greatest bombs of his career during these two songs.  Thanks to archive.org, now I can hear the crystal clarity of this SBD recording and hear exactly what the boys were doing, rather than my brain filling in the blanks and me saying, \"Whoa, did I really hear what I thought I heard?\"  And you know something?

This set begins with St Stephen and it has an audience splice at the beginning, but when the lyrics begin, the soundboard kicks in and it sounds really great.  St. Stephen > Eyes is really amazing... this recording is absolutely a top 10, or even a top 5 just for that alone. It's a shame the soundboard from the first set is gone. As far as audience recordings go, the first set isn't that awful, but its impossible to combine that recording with this one as a complete show because the quality is so different. The first set has really dominant shouts, when it starts some guy is screaming  \" hey man its cold rain and snow\" and it just gets worse and worse.

When I'm walking down the street with one of these shows on my ipod it's pretty darn close to being there. You can indeed absorb the unique energy of these shows and expereince the flavor and nuance that makes them what they are. This whole archive is absolutely marvelous. As I was just telling my buddy, I feel like I am back. I could quit my job today, whip out a batch of shirts and hit the road tomorrow if the band was still going. I'm serious. I now understand why I love these guys. Everything you need to live in this crazy world, everything you need to be happy and survive is right there, in these songs, in these lyrics. But I know y'all feel the same. First set anyone?",

Brings back so many great memories of a great night during a great run. Thanks to all who make this possible...",

I have a 1970 show that does the same thing with Mason's Children, it provides both ambiance and depth that you don't always get from a crystal clear SBD.",
