      "review_text": "Tomorrow Never Knows Although I wasn't at this show, I'm a huge fan of how they finally properly utilized Tomorrow Never Knows. Hearing it rage into Drums with that aggressive dual rhythm of Mickey and Billy makes you wonder why this was the only time it was (properly) displaced from the encore slot. \nThe Aiko>Playin>UJB>Baba>TNK>Drums is very nice, but imagine if TNK was regularly used in this type of fashion rather than only on this night.  With that said, there's a million 'what if' scenarios we all can dream of when evaluating the band beyond description.  \n\nSuffice to say, this show was and is probably underrated, not only due to the pre-drums UJB>Baba>TNK, but the Aiko is vocally spirited and the Playin is crisp.  First set openings of Jack Straw>Peggy-O remind me of suns setting to stage right at Deer Creek (ok, Stranger>Peggy-O at Deer Creek is probably more accurate), and a So Many Roads, well-played Stella, and rare mid-90s Baby Blue thrown in for good measure. Don't shy away, add this one to the collection...McNichols shows are always solid.",

      "review_text": "3 Cold Nights Jerry had problems all three nights of this run but Bobby really stepped up and jammed. Jerry left the stage for all of Easy Answers. The highlight for me was the Playing in the Band and obviously the Baba>TNK. I would love to hear a SBD of this show to see if Jerry is in the mix a little better because what I could hear was hot.\nI refuse to listen to the middle show because it was the worst I had ever seen or heard. Jerry was light hearted by the third night of problems and just had fun with it. Jerry laughing at his own mistake on Brokedown Palace was great and its also the last time I ever saw him....\nFare you well....thank you for all the years\nWe really do miss you.",

      "review_text": "Cool show! A very nice AUD, with one of the best shows of 1994, the second set, especially pre-drums, is as good as it gets. Playing In The Band is wild and not for the faint of heart, then sweetly dissolves into Uncle John's Band, what follows is probably Vince Welnick's finest moment, the crowd reacts cheefully during Baba O'riley, and you can tell the band is having some fun, just wonderful how TNK morphes into drums. Say what you want about Vince, but his Baba>TNK was always a highlight.",

      "review_text": "My #1 best show. Let me set this up for you a little...\n\nI dropped one at my friends apt, and we went to the show.\nI dropped the other in the lot.\n\nThis was the first show since '92 that me & my friends were all together and we were having a hugely good time.\n\nThe first set was nice, I remember it being especially clear... but that's all I really remember.\n\nThen \"It\" happened.\n\nI went into the bathroom (suprisingly no line) and changed into this crazy clown-thing costume. (Picture long flowing multi-colored full-length smock) and a red clown wig... complete with flashing red nose.\n\nMy friends said I was a walking trail. :~)\n\nThe second set opened up with a vengence and kept getting better. Seems like every other note I thought a Stephen was on the way. (side note here... they sound checked it at the very next venue.\n\nHighlight... A void (black hole?) open up over the stage at the start of Baba>Tomorrow and stayed into Drumz.  Huge show.\n\nI think the best way to say it is that it was one of those \"Life & Death\" kind of shows... ala 10-31-91 though not quite as good as that one.\n\nBang for the buck here.",

      "review_text": "Had to wash out my ears Simply put. These were my last shows for a reason. The peggy-o was weak from the start and the rest of the show wasn't much better. I almost skipped the other two McNichols shows but my wife made me go so I could protect her from the a-holes in the crowd(she was 8 months pregnant) The only saving grace of this show was the D/S which was good all 3 nights. Please don't listen to this objectively becase it will make sick.",

      "review_text": "11/29/94 At the time, these shows just did nothing for me. The 92 shows here were pretty anti-climactic musically too, even though they were the \"highly anticipated\" first shows after Jerry's sickness in 92. The 1990 run here however was excellent. You win some, you lose some. Such is life.\n\nBest show of 1994? Sorry Uffel, but I highly disagree. I think most folks that attended a lot of 94 shows, and who have listened to their fair share of 94 would also agree. I am not saying you are wrong, but if you want what I think is great 94, try: 3-16-94, 3-21-94, 3-27-94, 3-25-94, 10-5-94, 10-15-94, 6-13-94, 7-3-94, just to name a handful.",

But the madness peaked its minagerie in the Playin with your Mind.\n\nThe recording is much like the show decent for the time.",

      "review_text": "front row center ok so the mailorder folks at gdts hooked me up with a front row center ticket for this show...the band was pretty determined on this night...sparks were flying a bit..first set was really tight and driven with jerry reaching amazing highs with the vocalization on so many roads...even listen to jerry's playing during the jack straw...he had something to prove and this was one of those special nights in the post brent era where vinnie's playing and vocalization were strong and on the same page as the rest of the band...why jerry threw down his guitar and stormed off the stage as soon as bobby started up the easy answers is anyone's guess, but he was definately pissed off about the choice of that song at that moment..\n...anyway jer came back out for Set II and dropped a bright and powerful iko replete with the idiot boy line...there are a few serious highspots from this show but the one that you can't hear that i got to see was when jer steered the band into the baba...this was the only time i ever got to see jer put up his right arm and wave everyone off-you can hear the 45 seconds of quieter playing after the ujb and before the baba where the boyz are in the dead zone and jer steers it into a rocking teenage wasteland...lots of eye contact with vinnie and bang into the opening keyboard line's of baba...\n\nanyway a super tight night filled with soulful versions of all your favorite jerry ballads...peggy-o, so many roads, stella blue, and it's all over now baby blue(get in yer vw bug and get yer ass back to boulder, kid)...the next two nights in denver were fun and i remember floating around mcnichols during a hot terrapin, but this denver run was all about 11-29-94...a great night to be young and high and in the front row to see the f%$@in' grateful dead.",

Of course listening to everyone talking about \"best show of the year\" all week didn't help, but at least I got a kick out of the Denver cop who told me \"Go back to Massachusetts, we don't like your kind here\" as he escorted me from the building.",

      "review_text": "I was that freak in costume.. \n(Sorry, I didn't realize I had posted a review before under GR8fl Driver, I've lost that email and can't delete it. Going to leave this up as it's a better story)\n\nSince this is the anniversary of one of my favorite shows I saw I wanted to tell my story of that night.\n\nI was living in Denver and this was the first hometown show since '92, needles to say I was stoked.\n\nI had a plan. This was the first of a 3 night run and I was going to do it right.\n\nWe had some good SF dose left from the shoreline run earlier that year. I dropped one at the house and we (3 of us) went to the show. Little did my friends know, I had a surprise in my bag.\n\nIn the lot just before we got out of the car I took #2 and we went inside. It was easy, Big Mac usually was easy to get in, not always as easy getting out lol.\n\nThings started getting interesting about the time So Many Roads came up and by set break it was ON!\n\nAs my friends were chatting (one of the few times we all were together during a show, I had a habit of flaking off and wandering the crowd), as they were distracted I slipped out to the bathrooms.\n\nI got in a stall and took out my costume put on some makeup the best I could and as soon as I stepped out the bathroom got WIDE EYED.\n\nI was in full crazy multi colored tunic with dyed feathers and sequins. I was what my friend later called a \"walking trail\".\n\nOn the way back to my seat I was interrupted by someone who was ever so slightly out of focus holding a microphone. The strange entity asked me how I liked the first set and I said it was great (I was having LOADS of FUN) then they asked if I had any requests for the second set. No song came to mind and then I remembered the old adage that we got off the best when the band was getting off, so I just said \"I will leave it open\". That phrase was still bouncing around my mindspace along with the idea that I just got interviewed by a Dead staff member of some sort as I made it back to my seat just as the second set started.\n\nBy the time UJB came along, every note I was like something BIG is coming. Stephen? Nope.\n\nWhat we DID get was the only time Baba > TNK was played pre Drums. And wow was it the right one for my ears that night. I was fixated in the screens as a void/blackhole appeared over the band and sucked my mind into it.\n\nThings calmed down a bit after drums until the end of the show, but the fun wasn't over.\n\nI walked out into the crowd and there were friggin undercover cops everywhere.\n\nThey didn't do anything, but they were paying VERY close attention to me.\n\nCostume + November + Dead Show + dosed to the 9's.. yea\n\nI headed straight (lol) to the bathrooms to \"de-clown\" there were a few heads in there until right behind me two pair of poloshirt-slacks-&-brown shoes walked in, trying very hard to look like they belonged there. The place vacated.. quickly.\n\nI did as well.\n\nOutside, the fun continued. The crowd was being funneled to one side of the street to get to the parking lot and just as I got to the pinch point I heard a quick double tap of a car horn and the route was changed for me. The \"guy\" waved me to the other side of the street.\n\nI was scared shitless, of course all I had on me was a little weed.. the rest was already consumed going in to the show. So I was reasonably safe from a bust. Still, my spidey senses were working overtime.\n\nI passed one of those big school busses made into a tour wagon and the headdy said \"all aboard\".\n\nI still wonder what if I had got on. Instead I made it back to my car with my friends waiting for me.\n\nI de-clowned and handed over my keys as we went off to his place to finish the evening.\n\nEven though the show itself may not be that notable outside of the Baba>TNK, it was easily one of the greatest nights of my life.\n\nMiss ya Jerry.. every day.\n",
