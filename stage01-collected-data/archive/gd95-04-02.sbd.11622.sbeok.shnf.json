I remember the lot being uncharacteristic of the mayhem that we had all gotten accustomed to. I remember my bare feet sticking to the arena floor, and also the young usher kids being dosed and letting everyone on the floor, with big smiles on their faces. Wow, what a great time.\nThe band was on point in Memphis, say what you will about the '95 runs, all things considered. It was still the Boys, for better or for worse. The board recording is good, altho maybe has gone thru an analog gen. or two. Altogether, a 4-Star rating.",

We are all goin' to the show! In a pyramid no less!  Well, Ive heard horror stories of dead spots with the PA, but we were in the center about 20 rows from the floor and it was crystal clear. (Never figured out how we got such good seats, but then again, even a blind man knows when the sun is shinin')  The city welcomed us with open arms, and the boys were on. We boogied all night to Jerry and the boys, and then hit Beal Street to cap it off!  It was almost like the after-party in the lot when we used to be able to camp.

After a good show the night before (I believed the One More Saturday Night Encore was an April Fools joke - but now I think it was because they wanted us to get out in time to enjoy the Beale Street music scene).  The other reviews reminded me at lunch I said, feels like a shakedown opener.  Have to agree - everyone just knew it was coming.\n\nI definitely remember this being the better of the 2 shows.  It's difficult to point out the highlights, as the show was stong throughout (with minor exceptions).  The recording here is excellent (as good or better than the sound quality of our upper level mail order seats).",

Shakedown is huge, though it gets bogged down by that ubiquitous Welnick groove near the end.  The first set also had some local color in Memphis Blues > Tenn. Jed, which was cool (despite my handle, I'm not actually from Tennessee).  They closed the first set with Promised Land, which makes me wonder if Chuck Berry wrote the song just so the Dead could finish first sets with it.  Anyway, Bob went through the list of Sun Belt towns, none of which were in Tennessee, and got a nice reaction from the audience (at least in my area) when he mentioned Birmingham -- the next stop on the tour.  The second set, alas, is rather forgettable, although Last Time > Wharf Rat works surprisingly well (it seemed like an odd sequence at the time, maybe that's just me).  But I just loved hearing the encore of Unbroken, which I think was the second ever, and was my first... that's a very positive ending.",

Although the Shakedown was lyrically weak and shakey and the Althea was downright horrible, the second set was absolutely amazing. The post-space might be the best of 95. The Last Time is raging, the Wharf Rat is not rushed and fully explored, the NFA sounds like late eighties Dead, and then Unbroken Chain for the encore! The jam out of Estimated is pretty damn good too. I live in Memphis and was just 16 when I saw this show. It was the sixth show I'd seen and my last one. I also accidently smoked DMT during space..thought it was just pot, then BAM! The scariest yet most intense memory of my life.....",

      "review_text": "Shit!  where do ya even start with this one. One of my best life memories started out ice fishing on Lake Huron and ended in Memphis. Never had such a goodtime neither!  I generally icefish all winter, and this time I was saving up perch,  and I'd put it up in the freezer. Next thing ya know I had me 35 pounds of skinned/fillet yellow belly perch.  Then the crew of friends 25 strong decided we were all going to Memphis. All of us were from Ann Arbor cept my younger brother from Lauderdale. He flew up to Memphis, the rest of us ragtag outfit drove ourselves in style.  Anyway for fun and inspiration I grabbed up a couple of industrial deepfriers several sacks of potatoes and all that fish, every bit of it. \n\nWe rode into Memphis on March 30th and found our way to Motel 6 the whole crew and we took up most of the second floor. This place was right smack in the middle of the Memphis Ghetto. LOL, I ain't kiddin. Now we were second in the bunch to arrive behind my brother Steve who flew in and took a cab from airport. He got bored alone as he was so he went for a walk. Up the street 2 miles or so was \"Graceland\"  and he was on a mission. On his way back to the motel he cot hungery when he saw a chicken shack and he bought himself a whole damn bucket of chicken, and kept walking. I was standing up on a balcony watching his aproach and never laughed so hard till I pictured this small framed white man walking alone through the ghetto eating a gadamn bucket of chicken.  LOL I'm so glad he didn't get rolled.\n\nSteve ain't with us long and he has us convinced to all go back to \"Graceland\" and hang out. By this time more friends are arriving and checking in, and we grab several more to go to Graceland with.  By the time we got to Evlis's pad there were people laying out on the front lawn partying, the whole place was tyedyed with a few rednecks running around looking terribly confused. That was truly a sight to behold. On the way back we stopped a a grocery called Piggly Wiggly for some beers, and I swapped some old black guy behind the butcher counter his Piggly Wiggly apron for a couple bags of perch.  It's cool, still use it today.  Later that evening we all went to BB Kings joint on Beal street and ate a pile and a half of ribs, cept for my wife is a vegitarian. \"Thats the indian for \"bad hunter\". Soon after,  I started getting food poisning from scattered, smothered, covered, topped, chunked, and diced, over at Waffle House in Kentucky. I had to hit the sack early while the rest of them painated the town. \n\nThe next day was slow and pretty much uneventful was the usual hanging out around the venue all day and drank more beer than we needed.  The onie thing I noticed about Memphis was the complete open arms welcome of the local people are the definition of true Southern hospitality.  Even the cops were nice folks, and I have never admitted that anywhere in my life.  I could live amongst those people, no problem. The show there the first night was first rate, and I specially liked \"Take me to the River\" We ran into Owsley that night and he was a total dickhead as usuall.  I doubt that sour old man has ever had a real friend in his life. We got rid of him promptly, he's a real bummer when your trying to have a good time. After the show there we went down to the Beal street festivel, that was tha balls!  Steve and I ended up working security at the door for Bo Diddley in some bar.  The place was packed over capacity and we had to stop letting people in. We never made it back to the Motel 6 till 5 in the morning. No fry that night, we hit the sack.\n\nThe next day we did a late b'fast and went down to the peobody and watched the ducks take the elevator and march about. Then back to the venue for more fun and frolics around a large statue of Ramses.  The show that night was outstanding, I mean they went right for the meat and potatoes right off the get. Me and Steve were sitting on the steps staring down into the pyramid when some tall skinny guy walked over and handed us each a square and said enjoy, it's fresh.  LOL we were off to the races in 10 min's  I swear, and it was the kind that hung in there for days.  Encore Unbroken Chain, my first and last brought me to my knees. After thast show this young couple invited us to some back country revival that started like midnight. I figured like wtf, lets go, but all pf a sudden Steve says to me, \"Hey Joe! what about all that gadamn fish? Everyone is leaving in the morning, we gotta get back to motel 6 and fry.\"  So we high tails it back there and people knew, they were all there licking thier chops and waiting when we hopped out of that cab. Right away we turned oni the deep fryers, whopping up beerbatter, slicing and dicing potatoes, mushrooms , and eggplants. one fryer cooked up vegies while the other fryed up perch filets as fast as I could. At one point I had a line out the door of the room, and down the hall and around the corner.  Even house security was in line holding a plate, talking about low sodium on his.  Now thats fukin livin.  We trashed that room so bad with greese on the walls, floors, and celings, I think we all chipped in and tipped housekeeping like a c note. \n\nI think I cried when Steve got in a cab at 6 am to head for home, everyone else was a sleep. The 2 of us never slept that night. That was our very last show. Most memorable.",

Being that I was born in 1980, I wasn't exactly old enough to go out tour when they were still kicking. When I was 15 my parents told me I could go to a Dead show with my older brother, who had been going out on tour for a couple of years by '95, but only if it was in our home state of Tennessee. So finally my dreams had come true, we had tickets to this show! I was super hyped for it, but 2 days before we were to head out a terrible tragedy occured......my brother got arrested. He ended up spending a week in jail, and I missed my last chance to see the band that mezmerized me for the first note. Of course we all know the terrible tragedy that happened in Aug. of 95. But hey that's what our imaginations are for, right? I have seen The Dead, Phil, and Bobby and Ratdog several times, but I never got hear those sweet licks coming from stage left in person.

I remember that this show was probably one of my favorites of the 95' spring tour, and as far as \"re-listen\" goes, it's a spectacular SBD... especially the second set... and, yes, for even 95'.\nOne cool thing to note was that I recalled the noodling after \"Last Time\" was almost identical to that of 3/18 in Philly two weeks prior...

Listen to the 3/18 \"Last Time->Visions\" and this show's \"Last Time->Wharf Rat\" and you'll hear it.\nAnyway, it's a bummer that \"they\" have slammed the door on downloading via this site, but this show is \"out there\", and as far as 95' goes- get it.  Shame for those of you who missed it... I had second row seats on Phil's side for this one... section 1, row B, seat 36.  Very cool.  God bless GDTS.",

Mickey Hart's father passed away and the night was canceled.\n\nI lived in Memphis at the time and I have to say that the weeks leading up to this weekend were ELECTRIC. The vibe was flowing and everyone was knee deep in the pudding.\n\nThe first night we got dosed at the Brownstown Hotel CHECK IN COUNTER!\n\nThe cops were very cool on shakedown street, doiong their best to smile and let everyone have a time. \n\n'Bucket' was the opener and we were off! Bob did 'take me to the river' and at that point we knew we were in for a special weekend. \n\nMy g-friend and I cried during Wharf Rat.\n\nI lost a job over these shows and have never regretted one minute.\n\nBeale street was great.

      "review_text": "It unfortunately came down to money By the time this show occurred, the Dead were way past their prime (unfortunately) and it basically boiled down to money at that point. It was really a shame. Gone were the day of the theatres and in came the stadiums. Face it, the Dead were not a stadium band. Late in 1985, a \"different\", somewhat violent element began to become part of the festivities. This element basically retired me as a dead head (although I saw several shows in 1986, I felt the end coming). My first show was in Springfield, MA on 4/23/77 and I got hooked. Between 1977-1987, I saw 175 shows; every from the Capitol in NJ, to the Stanley in PA, Fox in Atlanta, Greek, Frost, MSG, & Red Rocks. I have few regrets of seeing only a few local shows after that. I regret that I regret never having seen some of the songs they brought back or had never played. I regret never seeing Jerry in shorts. I was lucky enough to see the Dead play in what I believe, for the most part, to be in their prime. As for this particular show, it has a very nice setlist, but as many of the shows from this era, things sound forced and strained, lacking the energy they possessed from 1977 - 1985. I urge everyone to to listen to shows from that era. Regardless, we all like the Dead, and that's the main thing. :-)",

      "review_text": "I sure miss it This was my last show. Listening to it now--thanks Archive--I'm crying.\n\n\"There are things you can replace and others you cannot\"\n\nFrom '89 'til '95 my life was surfing, climbing, skiing, hiking, environmental activism and dancing. The Grateful Dead was my constant companion. Their music and song were a soundtrack to my pursuits of heights, passions and loves.\n\nMy wife, Amy, and I came together at this show. \n\nI had just met her that February after returning to Memphis from a stint in the Bay Area that culminated in a run of shows in Oakland and LA. I had returned to Memphis to apply what I had learned working with non-profits in the Bay Area to the environmental and social justice problems in Memphis and the Mid-South. \n\nI met her in an art supply store where I was picking up paint for a faux finishing job and I knew when I saw her that she was the one--I'd seen her before in my mind's eye during a very ecstatic experience at a show a few years earlier in Tempe, AZ (the night before they brought H.C. Sunshine out of retirement). She was so young and beautiful, the first thing I asked was where she went to school (I wanted to find out if she was old enough for me). She told me that she had just dropped out of Auburn U, which instantly reminded me of an oft-repeated figure of speech that a friend who attended Auburn would use--\"I sure do love those Sugar Magnolias\".\n\nI only got to see her once before I left Memphis again to go see shows in Salt Lake and Oakland, and when I asked her for something to take with me, Amy gave me a kiss.  \n\nHere's where things really get wild. After the last Oakland show, I went down to the gas station next to our hotel with a sign that said \"Carry me back to Tennessee\" and the very first folks that offered me a ride were going straight back to Memphis. What's more, half way home we realized that they were the roommates of Amy's current boyfriend! Can anyone say synchronicity?\n\nAnyhow, my friends in Memphis had gotten me a ticket for April 2nd but not one for April Fools. Oh well, I asked Amy to go on our first date that night anyway. I'd always been able to figure out a way to get in and I figured I'd have no problem at all in my \"hometown\".\n\nI wanted to show her what the Dead were really all about, so I dressed in a lovely skirt and embroidered blouse and painted my face with lotus blossoms, roses and winding vines and we went down to the show with a friend who had a 3 foot wok and sacks of veggie goodness. He stir fried and I handed out bowls of free food all afternoon until the show started--whoops, I had forgotten to get Amy and I tickets.\n\nSo instead of going in at my wife's first show, we sat on the bluff next to the Pyramid and enjoyed watching the lot scene until some local evangelicals started bull horning about how the Dead was the voice of the devil. Well, that didn't sit right with me, so forgetting how I was dressed and my face painted, I went up and recited St. Stephen to them. This confused them to no end and they stopped preaching their ignorance and let me recite and explicate several of Robert Hunter's songs for them. \n\nA crowd had gathered so I turned my attention to the heads and started reciting \"And I Know You\" from the Terrapin Station Suite as I descended the bluff to the parking lot where I could see a large drum circle starting to form. As I recited it, I heard one person ask, \"who's that?\", another reply \"Robert Hunter\" and then another \"no, he's way older than that\". Upon reaching the end of the song and the bottom of the bluff, the drum circle went crazy. I had a half dozen or so gourmet apples in my backpack so I started passing them around the circle and was overjoyed to see several of the evangelicals taking bites from them while they danced. When my friends finally got out of the show they said they had seen me on the video screens inside with an image of someone else's sign merged in that said \"Need's a Saturday Ticket.\" Ha Ha!\n\nMy wife and I fully enjoyed the show the next night (this one) and couldn't have asked for a better one for her only show. After it was over, we took our beer, weed and whiskey down to a homeless camp under the bridge and spent the rest of the night drinking with and listening to the stories of some less fortunate friends. \n\nThis was a great show and we're sad it was our last.\n\nIf I've been a long time gone\nIt's not that love of you\nhas been forsaken or forgot\nor halved and broke in two\nOutside major darkness \nwhere the circle is complete\nthere's no fear that lovers born\nwill ever fail to meet",

      "review_text": "April 1st and 2nd in Memphis 1995 Granted that the last tour has many low points, but these two shows, to me, signify the true flexibility of the band. This was the first time that Grateful Dead had played in Memphis since 1972. Not only was the band playing in Memphis, but they were playing inside of a pyramid. The significance of the pyramid had been held by many of the \"heads\",; hence, the performance in 1978 in front of the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt.\n\nThe structure of both shows really testifies to the respect that the band had toward local lovers, and vice versa. So many \"river\", \"Memphis\" references in these two shows exemplifies the bands understanding of where they were and its' import.  \n\nThe audience response (esp. 4-1-1995), gives so much back to the band. Though the recordings may not be the best, the soul/funk of Memphis music oozes out of Grateful Dead and was unreal for those two nights in Memphis.\n\nI love both of these shows and recommend anyone who listens to sit back for several hours and just listen to both of them.",

Lots of energy and great exploratory jamming. Jerry seems to want to make up for a pretty weak Crazy Fingers. Last Time -> Wharf Rat also works surprising well. The middle of Set II is where this show shines.\n\nOther than that, Shakedown is worth a listen. There are some other nice moments. Unbroken is nice, but not quite there. A tough song to play live I guess.\n\nI'm giving it four stars for 95. No more than three overall though.",

I also had no desire to be accompanied by men wearing dresses.  Although there were plenty of them there???  The Dead hadn't played in Memphis for twenty odd years because of the \"riot\" that ensued.  The Band was displeased and said they would never play Memphis again.  Well, never say never, right?  Anyway, they performed again.  And, the \"new Dead followers\" reacted in the same manner.  Non-ticket holders rushed a door...I was tear gassed (which was interesting to say the least and a good story to tell later)and then rushed to my seat.  With that being said, I'm pretty much at the end of the story.  The show was not memorable.  It had it's moments of decent clarity and soulful Dead rambles.  But, overall it was a bunch of young new wanna be \"Dead Heads\" bouncing around thinking they all had the answers to everyone else's never asked questions. I'm glad to say I \"saw\" the Dead.
