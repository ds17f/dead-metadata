      "review_text": "Solid all around, fun 1980 show This was one of my first Dead tapes, so there may be a little bias due to nostalgia, but it really is a great show.  The boys usually threw down at the Capitol theater (check out 11/24/78), and this is no exception.  After the April fool's gag, the show really takes off - sweet Candyman, great China/Rider, and a Shakedown encore.  If you like stuff from the Brent era, this is highly recommended.\n\nI think this copy sounds better than the other SBD - a little fuller low end.  Watch out for Cooledit/Soundforge in the lineage - it can really be hit or miss when it comes to home editing.",

      "review_text": "I can't be the only one ...who hears the effect of too much audio-editor noise reduction, lopping off chunks of frequency that's been sampled as 'noise'.  Unfortunately, it takes those frequencies out of everything - voice, instrument, dead air.  It's that odd chipmonk-y tonal quality that makes it sound like you're listening to something that's being mildly processed by a vocoder and passed through an aluminum tube before it goes into your ears.  Or a flanger maybe.  I find it off-putting.  I appreciate the fact that people love these things so much that they want to make them sound great, but in a very real way these recordings are historical documents -- you gotta go easy on the alterations -- Please!  An earlier review noted the fuller bottom on this SBD, which is true, but I have a hard time choosing this over its alternative if only for that very slight Darth Vader-ish quality to some of the sounds.  4 for the show, 1 for the processing.",

      "review_text": "I WAS THERE!!!!!! First, let me just say that I have been looking for a tape of this show for 25 years.  I found it today and I am ecstatic.  I remember this show like it was yesterday.  Tickets were only available through a lottery run by 102.7 WNEW-FM in NYC.  The Dead did three shows at the Capitol Theater in Passaic, NJ, a small theater with about 2500 seats.  I sent my self addressed stamped envelope into the radio station and a couple weeks later got it back with a short letter beginning with the salutation:  Greetings Deadhead!  The letter informd me that I won the ability to purchase 2 tix for a show.  It gave me an appointment on a particular date and time to go to Pasaic and buy my two tix.  I took the day off from work, went to the Theater and bought my tix.  I opened the package and they were a bright shiny gold, the golden tickets, a lot like Charlie and the Choclate Factory.  I looked at the tickets ROW F on April Fool's Day!  The next problem: who to bring with me.  I took all my close friends names, wrote them on pieces of paper, put them in a hat and picked out Maggie, not a better companion in the world for this special evening.   We went to the show and when the boys came out an were tuning the wrong instruments, I knew this show would go down in history.  We laughed through Promised Land, realized the show would be great during Candyman.  This was the first time I heard Feel Like a Stranger and it delighted me and everyone in the theater as well. We danced and sang and revelled in the music of the evening.  At the end of the show during a terrific version of \"Around and Around\" I felt like Bobby was singing directly to me as he sang \"Rose out of my seat, oh I had to dance\".  My name is Rose and the way he enunciated that word was just thrilling.  this was one of the best nights of my life and I could not be happier to find it here, on this terific site - 25 years later.",

The jam after Estimated Prophet is sweet, reminiscent of the jazzy feel of 1973-74. (I wish Phil were louder on this recording here.) He's Gone has some imperfections in vocal harmonies, but pleasant overall. The jam into the Other One is just great, as is the Other One itself. Not Jerry's best vocal on Stella Blue, but a solid Stella none-the-less, climaxing in some moving guitar work.",

      "review_text": "I was there too One of the great things about having seen all those shows is that now they are all over the internet, and it's awesome and so amazing. I really couldn't believe that I was looking for this show, thinking about this show this month, April , and viola!, here it is. I remember getting the notice that I won the opportunity to see this show, the gold tix themselves, man, it's giving me chills. I have to disagree though with whoever said that when they did the opening tune ( Promised Land ) and they had switched instruments, I looked around from where I was up around the 5th row,  and it seemed that a lot of folks were at their 1st show, and really weren't cognizant that they were being pranked, but I knew we were in for a helluva ride when they switched back to their respective instruments, the place really started to explode, they played it with such a driving force, one of the most memorable openings I was lucky enough to see. Perhaps it'll sound different as I give it a listen these 28 yrs later, but I am just so glad to be one of the 70's survivors that has kept up with the technology and can catch all these shows I was at on the web. peace and love to all out there, blessings for Jerry and Pigpen, Brent and Keith, all who have come and those who are gone now too. Knowing that you can't live life over, I'd have to say that I wouldn't have changed a thing, but if one could have a do-over, I would have tried to have hung out with Jerry, it's so sad that he seems to have been alone before he passed.",

The show has a couple good picks, but overall it doesn't really hang together.\n\nBAD-There is a disturbing lack of difference between the April Fools version and regular version of Promised Land\nBAD-Candyman is unremarkable, there isn't much of a jam in it\nV.GOOD-MAMU and Big River are actually well jammed out; this is extremely rare for them\nV.GOOD-Friend of the Devil has a good, soaring Jerry jam\nGOOD-It's All Over Now is decent, high-energy. A good version.\nNOT SO GOOD x 4-The rest of Set 1 is just average.\n\nGOOD-China>Rider is good, an above average version with some decent Jerry jams in Rider.\nV.GOOD-There's a very cool Prophet Jam\nV.GOOD-He's Gone, which has sucked in all the 80s versions I have listened to, is actually good here.\nNOT SO GOOD-Other one is very average, nothing special\nBAD-Stella is very poorly played, the band messes up the timing more than once\nNOT SO GOOD-R&R is average\nBAD-Shakedown is...OK. The song part is final, but as for the final jam...there isn't one. The guys just noodle quietly for two minutes and then call it quits. :[\n\nGenerally, this show ain't great. It's overrated.

I traded tickets we won (they were done by raffle) from one of the other two nights for this one as I thought April Fools would be best. I'll never forget Jerry & Brent on Drums and Weir singing and playing keyboards. Due to what we had ingested earlier we couldn't tell the difference until we could see the stage about 20 seconds into the tune. Great small theatre to see a show!",

The performance is laughably bad, but had to be hilarious at the time.  Then they do Promised Land for real; nothing could be further from the truth than to say like a previous commenter that there was a \"disturbing\" lack of difference between the two versions. \n It was night vs. day.  They go on to play a pretty lackluster first set with a tame, jamless song selection.  \n\nBut the second set more than makes up for that.  After Jerry gets a little exploratory in Stranger (if it's 1980, it's Stranger, they played it 12 times in 14 shows at one stretch this tour).  Then they completely turn up the heat for China>Rider.  Jerry inserts an extra jam, or does a normal jam in the wrong place, right after Bob's verse.  It reaches such a peak you'd think they don't need to do another one, but they do!  I thought 5/10/80 was my favorite China>Rider, at least after 74, but I'm rethinking that.  \n\nAnd the intensity doesn't drop with Estimated, either.  OK, He's Gone is a long, boring song, but in those days, it led to some fabulous jams and transitions.  The Other One that follows is no slouch, either.  A lot of people pan Brent's keyboard sound; I love it.  Would your rather hear that or Keith pounding out honky tonk chords on his Yamaha all show?  The drummers stay out for space, making the drums actually growl behind Jerry's swirling cadenzas.  I don't know if there was a curfew or what, because they cut Shakedown way short.  ",
