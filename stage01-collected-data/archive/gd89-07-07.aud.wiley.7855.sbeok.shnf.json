I don't think any of that had hit me until I heard \"Standing On The Moon\" for the very first time ever at this show.\n\n\"Somewhere in San Francisco in a back porch in July\"\n\nThat line would ring in my head for months through saying goodbye to my friends at Abington Friends School, where I had just finished my freshman year of highschool, and to our friends from our years living at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, where my Dad was a professor. And it kept ringing in my head on the trip west, as we moved into our new family home, as I began life at Berkeley High Schoool and began seeing many more shows a year than I'd ever imagined possible before the move. \n\nOne of the things about the Grateful Dead that continues to amaze me is how much the stories these songs tell are, in fact, our own stories. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of Matrix Tapes, and this is hardly as exciting as the setlists we'd see come October of '89, but this show is more than worth a listen. \n\n\"The coast of California must be somewhere over here, over here!\"",

I remember being up front along the rail as the other posted, except i remeber security on the other side of the rail squirting everyone down in the front with hoses, and what a relief it was.  The music was incredible, I too remeber that SOTM and the scarlet>fire was on fire.\n    As for the end of JFK, for those who never knew.  The Sixers and the Flyers wanted a new venue, they were sick of the Spectrum.  Now at this time in the late 80s and early 90s, these teams sucked.  They could not sell out the curent venue, so why the hell should they deserve a new bigger and better venue, right?  They threatened the city of Philadelphia if they did not build them one that they would move across the river to Camden.  Jfk was in dire need of repair, so let's tear down JFK and build a new venue there, it would cost too much to repair JFK.  The stadium was actually condemned 4 days before the Grateful Dead were to play.  The city was afraid of riots so they waited until after the show to announce the closing. The who were scheduled 2 days later to play but they moved that across the street to the Vet, which also is now gone.  I happened to be friends with the president of the company who had the contarct for repairs to JFK.  He told me it was about $100k to make the repairs to the stadium, fairly cheap, they condemned the stadium to make the sixers and flyers stay in Philly.\n    My favorite venue destroyed by two losing sports teams.  Sad but true.  JFK could hold 100K people for the record.",

      "review_text": "Brother Brent One of my all time favorite first sets.  Not only is it a strong set list but all the tunes are played with enthusiasm and creativity.  The somewhat unusual Iko location, Garcia just going nuts during it.  A killer Loser with Mydland just laying down a heavy key line that perfectly suits the song's theme.  Jerry's Ramble on with great MIDI effects.  Weir just smoldering through Let it Grow and then Brent absolutely tears the house down with *the definitive Blow Away.  Older Heads gave BM a hard time for a long time, and sadly, it wasn't until his passing and the professional, though largely uninspired work of Welnick (and to a lesser extent Hornsby) that people started giving Brent his due.  The guy's pipes were the blues.  The evident emotion and pain as he rips through Blow Away will leave you with chills.\n\nThe second set has a great Scarlet>Fire and O1>Wharf Rat (granted, neither is a uniqure pairing, but well played). \n\nThe sound quality is very good, well worth the d/l.\n\nHighly Recommended",

For this 7-7-89 I have recorded every song on 2 CD\u00c3\u00c2s except box of Rain, drums, and \u00c3\u00c2jam.\u00c3\u00c2 Why? Because every song is very very good and half of them are great. Standouts are Hell, Scarlet, Fire, Other One, Wharf , Lovelight, Heaven\u00c3\u00c2s Door, and huge big wow what was that and why didn\u00c3\u00c2t it happen all the time for Blow Away. Blow Away blew me away. I hope that version appears elsewhere but I have not heard it. See Excellent Reviewer Brother Brent (below) for further insight into Blow Away. I totally agree. I never gave Brent his due. Now that I have access to all of the recordings in his time with the Dead my opinion of him has really gone up. And frankly, my opinion of Keith G. has gone down.\n\nThere is a good mix of soundboard and crowd, actually a perfect mix for me. You really get the feeling you are at the concert. I do not download \u00c3\u00c2Aud\u00c3\u00c2 recordings but love it when is a soundboard with audience. Frankly, I am perplexed that there are 4 Star reviews here. Jerry and Bob do not screw up the lyrics. The band energy is very high, the crowd energy is very high, and the recording is crisp and clear. This is clearly a 5 Star performance to me and once I get organized and categorized I am confident this will be in my top 15%. 5 STARS!!",

      "review_text": "This sounds like an AUD to me Agree with all the comments about the quality of the performance.  This is one of my alltime faves.\n\nBut this recording sounds more like a very good AUD, not a board/aud mix.  It's most apparent in the vocals and snares and cymbals, where you get some of the telltale phasing effects. \n\nLotsa taper made excellent recordings of this show because the sound at JFK was so huge and you basically were recording in the free field.  I was right behind the taper section for the entire show and it sounded pretty much like this tape does.  I'd speculate it shotguns from the section pointed right at the stacks (comparing it to the FOB copies I have), but that's just a guess.\n\nIt *could* be a board mix, but I'm a tad skeptical.  Great sounding tape though.",

This is yet another example that proves that the boys were not done after 1977.\n\nListen for a nice Blow Away, a smoking Scarlet Fire, a fine Knockin' encore, and one of the finer SOTM's. Of course the SOTM is nice because way too many of them occured in the last few years and featured Jerry's dying voice. This one sounds nice, and while Jerry ain't perfect, he's pretty good.\n\nAs far as the AUD thing is concerned...this is a Healy matrix.

I don't know why this show has not been released.  It might even be the single greatest Dead show of the '80's.  The band is confident, fully communicative, rocking and psychedelic at the same time, with the shaman effect in full swing.  \n\n    The recording definitely sounds like an audience.  There's some weird level adjustments in the middle of the Scarlet jam.  Nonetheless, I hope this show sees the light of day.  \n\n    When my friends might ask me, \"what is a grateful dead show like,\" I would like to be able to share this one with them.  This is music that dances in the stratosphere of the spirit with confidence, precision, communication, and awareness.  This is not a meditation, this is a concert.

Many heads will tell you that this could have been the best show ever IHO.\nI couldn't believe all the ppl that showed up. Every single parking lot for miles was full of heads.  \n\nPPl on the floor where holding up there tickets to sell to collectors because it was to be the last show at JFK. I also remember\nppl taking chunks of concrete home in their backpacks.   \n\nLots of paper - I believe woodstocks I think\"! wait I also think blue lighting bolts boy where they strong, lol.\n\nTHE BEST SCARLET FIRE EVER! Brent's Blow away in the first set \"do you guys remember open up that fist , feel that breeze -oh my god this band was was insane- a breeze came by that no one in that huge concrete thing could not deny it to be true. Also does anyone remember the guy that jumped of the back of JFK during Wharf Rat(ill get up and fly aw***), they\nsaid he bounced, and lived omg no joke. (I think RfDead is correct a Girl fell off and lived) correction\n\nShaman effect is a good way that darazn1 describes it. And being possible # uno show of the 80's period. VERY intense lot scene!!!! ppl where going across rt 95 to a public pool or somekind of pool in heards going in and out like a cattle drive every one was wondering where the water drenched ppl where coming from very strange.\n\nMy wife though the keys to our rabbit in the trash at the end of the night and we couldn't\nget into our car - I said I bet you throw them away, we looked in trash there they were. OMFG.\n\n Echoing what Emmell said- \"Sweltering heat and high humidity in a crumbling venue. People laid out on the grass in various stages of dehydration\"\nhe was not joking at all.  I also remember getting up and going down into the stadiums food / drink/ rest room area, there where oil / hazardous barrels off to the side with just caution tape to keep you away from all the toxic waste and crumbled up junk. The JFK staff had a big fight with GD crew\nand the philly fire department wanted it shut down at around 1-2 in the afternoon. that's when things started getting of the hook -80 90 thousand heads and your going to shut the place down \"you cant do that\"\nall kinds of rumors of what was going to happen it was a real life soap opera.  They deciding to let the show go on and one hell of a show it was. Out of the 85 -90 shows i caught \nthis was in my top three. 5 stars all the way many ppl where changed for life after this one included yours truly - \nalthough RFK 90 was so similar and awesome too. \nWanna see Garcia one last time for real??? No joke- follow this holy grail and Make a night out of this show and your dreams \nmight just come true too, just beleive!!!!!!!!!!!",

Since me and my crew lived in the burbs, we didnt drive down but instead took the el and the subway, nothing really special about that except the ride home was alot of fun.  Man it was hot that day, so hot that the new tie dye I bought for the occasion at CRITTERS (this would be my last tie dye by the way, never really liked them much although my GF at the time loved them)bled to my skin... I found this out when I decide to take the shirt off and put it on my head bandana like... looked cool to me.  Anyway the show rocked and so did JFK!!!!! Literally that place feel apart that night. The best memories were the intermission wave that seemed to go on forever plus I couldnt take my eyes of the dancers down on the floor during the first set.  As to JFK... The Eagles had played in the vet since it opened in the early 70s.... The Who played the vet that summer, not JFK....  The Stones did a few sound checks in JFK but the city said to them you will have to play the vet.. The dead refused to, thankfully play at the vet... So the Dead not only closed Winterland 11 years earlier they also closed JFK and thank God I was there to witness it.  As for this recording, I have listened to the whole thing thru my comp speakers and it sounds wonderful... Wish I could DL it and listen to it on the home system...

My other two friends that I was with that day still say the same also.\n\nThis is the best show I've ever attended in all aspects. Crowd, music, set list, and most of all - The VIBE!   What a vibe there was that day. This was my first outdoor GD show and the craziest crowd I was ever in.  I mean it was insanity all day. It seemed like the Dead were f-ing with our heads. Of course, the 5 different kinds of paper we sampled before the show had a lot to do with it, but never-the-less me and my two friends were tinkering on the edge of insanity all day.  To make things even stranger, we had a parapalegic in a wheel chair sitting behind us and partying with us just as hard as we were. It didn't seem like he was with anyone else.  How did he get there??\n\nHornsby and the Range opened up and then the Dead came on as the sun was beginning its descent. As they played it seemed like the music was pulling the sun down.  They amazingly ended their 1st set just as the sun dipped below the coliseum. What perfect timing.  \n\nThe boys were really on this day too. Iko Iko had everyone doing a tribal like clap-chant thing and then came the best Rooster I've ever heard to this day and I'm not a big Rooster fan. But listen to the use of Jerry's MIDI on this.  I thought it was me that day hearing it that way but listening back - it really was sounding like that.  Whew! I wasn't losing my mind after all.\nBobby's screaming during Hell in a Bucket and Memphis Blues sent shivers through my nervous system that is still vibrating to this day.\nJerry sang a passionate Ramble On Rose while I watched a hippie chick do a swirling dance with a bottle of Vodka in one hand.  How did she get that in??\nBrent pours everything he has into Blow Away.\n\nDoes anyone remember the microphone stands on the stairways all around the coliseum that day? You had to literally walk around them to get to your seats. The whole first set we were wondering why they were there. Then at the intermission we found out.  All those microphones came on and picked up thousands of conversations and relayed them out of the house PA.  In turn, this sounded like a whirl wind of spirits flying around the coliseum.  Did I mention that they were f-ing with our heads that day?  It was like an Acid Test.  I couldn't move.  We were glued to our benches.  So much for trying to get up to go and get a drink at intermission.\n\nThe 2nd set was just as stellar. I traveled through a hundred universes and dimensions that day which I still haven't fully returned from.  I knew right then and there that I wasn't going to be the same from this day on and I'm not.  In good way of course.  When the last note of Knockin ended and the crowd started leaving, we sat there wondering - what the hell just happened here!  We were STILL glued to our benches.  In fact I think we were the very last ones to leave the coliseum.  What normally would have been an hour train ride back home took us several hours as we kept getting off at the wrong stops.  \n\nTwo days later we went to see The Who across the street at the Vet and would you believe I was still weirded out from that Dead show two days before.  What an impact that show left and I'm still wondering - what the hell happened that day!!!\n\nFor those who weren't there, this is a Philly classic and every song here is top quality. It deserves 10 stars if I could give it.",

I always somehow walk straight back to the car - good directional skills - don't even check what row - you know - one year coming out of a dead show Jerry scrambled my tuning fork up so bad I couldn't find my damn car - a lot time and wandering went by - that whole summer until I went back to another show - I could never find my car in parking lots - I would just get outside the mall or whatever and just laugh - damn you Garcia - where's my car...and after the next show re-calibrated - I love the dead for stuff like that... \n\nBack at JFK I had water to share and was greeted upon leaving the show by a desperate but happy, thirsty mini mob - A guy looked at me an hollered \"water, water\" at the top of his lungs (we had carried several jugs in and had a almost full one coming back out) a swarm of people turned - Boy did I hand that jug off fast - someone yelling \"just give it to them.\"  \"Thank you, thank you - desert island stuff ...man we had fun, laughed at everything, slack jawed and amazed all day - at everything and everyone - including our moronic selves.  \n\nIt was a riotous event, the band, the sun set - big fat orange, hazy sun going down - the Brent breeze it was all there - even that stupid plane flying over head - thank you everyone for this database - and those reminiscing I haven't had the old steal your face right off your head smile in a long, long, time - \n\nother shows out here are doing the same thing for me - helping me to remember and I'm freakin' remembering, long term memory not as shot as the short term - WOW - what hot fun in the city, in the summer - I was blown away by how good this show was considering there were about 100,000 people there - and crazy open stadium acoustics but big time energy, big time sound system and big time fun - thank you EVERYONE!  From the bottom of my heart.\n\nPaul\nAuthor - Journey Home",

I have had a superb audience of this show for many years but just checked out this Healy mix---well it actually sounds more aud. that sbd. but that's okay 'cause it sounds wonderful.\n\nThis is one of those all time great shows.  Certainly one oftheir best stadium gig in this year and '90.  Only Three Rivers in '90 gets close to this and even then the emotion of this show overwhelms it.  I can feel this show when I listen to it and I wasn't there!\n\nTruly inspiring.  So many highlights I won't even mention them.  We all know them.  Okay! But just three. The SOTM deserves special mention as does the Scar>Fire. Lovelight is a special treat and it's how you can tell these guys were really on this night.\n\nI know some people don't likesound  the reminiscing reviews and just want the goods but they can kiss my ass.  Many of the reviews here are deeply moving and make me feel like I'm still part of a great community as aoposed to a little downloader sitting at home with his finger on the \"enter\" button.  And that's what it has always been about.\n\nI saw Rich and Alpine this summer.  The Alpines were great shows. Oddly \"they\" put out the Rich show for us.  Not nearly as good as this one, Lemieux.  Get with it, buddy! I wish I'd seen this one too.\n\nIn the fall I came to Philly to see them play the Spectrum and it met every expectation. I loved the crowd and the people I met.  Many kind moments.  There were a few key places to see the Dead and this Philly was one of them.  Thank you for a real good time!\n\nThe freakiest thing was the lack of a solid Shakedown St. but I was told it was over at the JFK lot and we walked over.  I could see what looked like a semi-demolished stadium in the distance in the darkness looking like the hull of a shipwreck.  It spooked me and we decided to just head back to the motel.\n\nLove you Philly!  Many wonderful shows from both these venues.",

Believe it or not, I was starting to lose interest in them at this time in '89.  I saw some crummy shows at the rectum in '88 and decided to fade out for a while.  I did catch the stones across the street in Sept. I did see the Dead at this venue with Dylan in '87.  The Dylan was absolutely ridiculously bad, but the Dead were good.  All one set I believe.  Listening to this show, I think it rates as the best the band ever did in Philly, and as they played the rectum like 50 some times going back to '68 that is saying something.  This stadium has an incredible history to it.  Originally called Phila. Municipal Stadium until renamed after the assasination of J.F.K.  One of the most famous boxing matches of all time took place here in the '30's Tunney vs. jack Dempsey.  I remember my father taking me to the Flyers parade in '75 after they won their 2nd stanley cup.  I was only 6 years old but I remember all these naked streakers running down the field (truly 70's craziness).  Anyway, how can you beat the Dead closing this place!  Totally historically creepy.  Can't believe they did not do Samson and Delilah!  But the show was very well played in this huge sprawling American stadium.  Something epic about the ambiance of this show.  Anyway they are closing the Rectum this year.  The Dead will play one more concert here on May 1st, 2nd 2009.  Fortunately, I will be at both shows.  Looking for Samson and Delilah on May 2nd.  Right across the street from old J.F.K. Hope to see you there.",

Almost like a flock of starlings cruising the sky but in slow motion. There were complete sets of speakers in the rear of the floor area for the people up in the rear could hear clearly.

I was fortunate to pick up an advance copy of the CD/DVDs and am watching/listening now. Definitely worth picking up!\n\nThis was the summer before my senior year. I was 16. My freinds and I decided to hit as many shows as we could that summer. We trucked up to Buffalo for a great show and made it to Philly with more than enough time to get a great parking spot and set up the tent. The vibe of this show was memorable as has been mentioned and its been great reading the anecdotes. Its funny the stuff you remember. We all distinctly remember seeing a guy pass out and hearing his head thud as we made our way to our spots on the field on Phil's side. Could have been a bummer but he was attended to and the overall vibe was so positive.\n\nA few points I haven't seen made:  Phil's bass intro to the Other One just thundered. He didn't always do it in this era and it was awesome. This show sounded great from where we were.\n\nI was a Brent fan and never really understood the older head's animosity. This was certainly an awesome Brent show. I don't think it was the best Blow Away ever - the drummers are out of synch and off tempo at the start - but the Brent rap was certainly the best Brent moment I ever saw or have heard. \"There's something I've been trying to get through to you.\" Brent would often go for things vocally and come up a bit short of his aim. Vocal improv ain't easy (Pigpen was a master). Here he just goes for it and nails it! \n\nIn his generally negative Allmusic review of the official realease, Jeff Tamarkin uses this Blow Away to state \"Mydland's preening and improvising quickly goes from awkward to annoying over the course of the song's dozen minutes, and makes one wish for one of the band's principal vocalist/writers to wrest the microphone away and implore him to stick to backup vocals.\" Well by all accounts, they were pushing him to do more! Some people still don't get it, and that's ok. At least take solace in the fact that Jerry seemed to love playing with the guy. But even if you're not a Brent fan, you gotta have a pretty hard heart not to admit that the soul-baring emotion poured forth here and connection with the crowd is impressive. It sure made me grin! A totally memorable, touching moment.\n\nBy the way, Blow Away appears to have been Jerry's idea here. He's the one who starts it up after Let It Grow and he is all smiles. You can see him lean over to Brent as they go into Let It Grow and appear to tell him he wants to do Blow Away next. I love how Brent pops in a piece of gum at the start like \"here we go!\"\n\nAnd what a treat to be able to wander back to the tent to discuss what was just witnessed. It wasn't yet downhill from here. What a summer!",
