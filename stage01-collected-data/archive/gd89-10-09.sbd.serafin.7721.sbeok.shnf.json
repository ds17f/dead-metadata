The whole show was great but the return of Dark Star ushered in the great golden age of the Grateful Dead. What can you say about a show when they kick off the second set with Playing!! Often overlooked was the post drumz. Fantasy> Hey Jude. What about the sick Death Don't. Finally the joyous Good Lovin! \nFor all of us  who continued on this amazing tour, what a story we all had to share with the rest of the Grateful Dead nation!! Thanks archive!!!",

I got on a bus that I had not even seen come by yet!\n\nFor the next 15 years I attended Grateful Dead shows and Jerry shows hoping to hear them play Dark Star, but never succeeded. Until this night.\n\nListen to the crowd go wild at the first notes. Sustained roaring for several minutes. Obviously alot of other folks were also really needing to hear this breakout of a tune not played in several years.\n\nThe midi-spaces during Playing In The Band, during the Dark Star, and leading into drumz never had more 'out-there' energy. The Death Don't Have No Mercy contained Brent's best organ solo ever imho, and Jerry's final phrases to conclude the cosmic journey of this song and the whole powerful section of this set from the Dark Star thru Death seemed like putting the lid back on Pandora's box of the mysteries of life and the Grateful Dead revealed to the faithfull during this show.\n\nAnd then the desert to cap it all off - the first Attics of My Life played in 18 years as the encore.\n\nThose within the magical Hampton Coliseum this night would never forget this show. I drove back home, 500 miles the same night after the show, occasionally checking behind me to make sure the holy grail, the quest of my dead career, was still safely riding with me. \n\nAnd so it was.\n\nmj",

I had this one in my collection many years ago, and although I wasn't yet going to shows in '89, the energy of the crowd as they broke out dark star for the first time in several years was really something!  I am very pleased with the sound quality of the show. Although I am not usually a proponent of audience recordings over soundboards, for the sole purpose of experiencing that deafening roar of ecstacy, could anyone upload an audience?  I imagine this show just got posted, seeing all of the comments in the last week.  I love this site! \n          KEEP IT ALIVE GUYS!",

Playing is super and the breakouts alone make it a piece of history.  Sound quality has a quirk in that the kick drum is really up front in the mix, especially during the Death Don't, but still overall a good sound.\n\n1st set is solid and has the Stranger from \"With Out a Net\".  The 2nd set is all highlites in particular the Playin>UJB>Playin>Dark Star segment.  The post drums is just as great with the Death Don't a unique pairing of TS>Good Lovin' and the Attics encore.\n\nIf you don't have this one stop what you are doing now and download.",

      "review_text": "My Last Show... This wonderful run (well...ok, two show run...) at Hampton was the last time I saw the Grateful Dead. I had just flown back into Norfolk after one of the few leaves from the Navy I took without going on tour. I was dejectedly winding my weary way back to the base when a very confused announcer on the radio said that he didn't know this band, but that the Warlocks were playing Hampton Coliseum. A rather large smile plastered its way onto my face and I nearly wrecked getting to the nearest ATM. \n     When tickets went on sale, I decided not to play it safe and just go when the store opened. There were only about 30 of us in the lot and I knew most of them. This was going to be absolutly wonderful.\n     Was it? Well, all you need to do is take a listen. Only the second kamakazie show ever and what did they give us?...The first Dark Star since '84 and the first Attics since '72!!! Jerry was still nominally healthy and the rest of the boys...well, ever since the summer tour of '88 they had been tighter than a Haliburton stock option on Nov. 3, and (did I really just write that?...) Just listen. I promise a smile. And that's what it's all about, isn't it!",

That said I had two versions of it, one an amazing SDB, the other an equally unbelieveable audience and I have to admit, the vibe of the audience was bordering on surreal and I prefer that.  This show in particular holds special memories as I was driving from Tahoe Donner to Tahoe city when I popped set 2 of the audience version into the car for the first time and drove in a white out blizzard to see Leftover Salmon playing at Humpties, needless to say, in that car, with this energizing show, it was like altered states when darkstar came on, the crowd is in ecstasy, elated, not unlike the Floyd orgasm, I felt connected to that parallel universe forever more, indellibly etching my memory...for the better.",

I haven't downloaded this version as I have master FOB's so I can't comment on the sound quality.  What is most unique about this show and what makes it one of the best Dead shows to have attended was after the gig (aside from the breakouts of course).  When the encore finished, the crowd died down to near silence.  We dare not ask for more, that would be way too tacky after what they just gave us.  The lights came on and we erupted in thunderous applause.  We were cheering each other for being there.  Everywhere you looked people were hugging, high 5ing, crying with joy...truely sick.  I packed up my stuff and rushed out to call in the bad news to a friend in Massachusetts that could'nt make it.  As I came out of the coliseum (a beautiful building from the outside yet a skanky sweat dripping dump on the inside...great sound though) you could hear waves of crowd spilling out screaming, roaring...I have never seen nor heard anything like it.  As I got to the entrance of the parking lot, a good 200 yards away, a cop grabbed me by the arm and said \"what the Hell is going on over there?\".  I said \"history was made tonight, history!\"\n\nFive stars for the experience.",

      "review_text": "\"Hey man, you got your Attics!\" I was one of the lucky few thousands that was at this monster show, and along with the birth of my baby girl, it is the memory that I will cherish most of all for the rest of my life.  I have certainly never been to any live concert that comes close to equaling the experience.\n\nIt was the fall semester of my junior year at Penn State in 1989, and my buddy Mike and I heard about the \"stealth\" Warlocks shows from the daughter of a woman that lived in State College who used to date Rob Wasserman and was friendly with Bob Weir.  We immediately agreed that there was obviously no option other than scraping together every dime we could and heading down to Hampton for the shows.\n\nWe got to the 10/8 show at around five o clock that afternoon, and no tickets were to be found.  They had sold out, and nobody kicked us any down in the lot.  We missed 10/8.  I was bummin', coming all the way down with no tix for either show was starting to seem like a big mistake.  But later that night we spied a trailer set up at the far end of the parking lot outside the venue, with about fifty or so Heads lined up outside it. It turned out they were selling tickets for the 10/9 show.  Both Mike and I scored tix and our outlooks suddenly changed mightily.  Those lime green beauties with the \"Warlocks\" in gold embossed lettering were a joy to behold.\n\nWhile the show was on that first night, I remember coming upon a pretty young thing hanging by a fountain right outside the Coliseum.  We could hear the faint strains of Help->Slip echoing from inside the venue, and she was in tears that she couldn't get inside the show that night.  I comforted her by saying that we were both going in tomorrow night, and that was going to be the big show anyway.  I had no idea how prophetic my words were.\n\nWe couldn't afford a hotel room, so we partied in the streets all night long.  As soon as they allowed cars back in the lot, around 8am or so, we pulled in and I sat myself down at the front of the line that had already started to form at the yellow police tape about 100 yards away from the Coliseums entrance.  This was a general admission show and I wanted prime position on the floor.  The ten or so hours before they let us in the venue flew by, and my perserverence paid off.  I wound up in the best spot I could imagine when they let us in: right in front of the stage, smack dab in the middle of Jerry and Bob.  When the band took the stage, the boys were clearly in a fantastic mood.  Phil was all smiles, pointing, laughing, and waving at people in the crowd.  The first set smoked, but was not exactly mind blowing.  Other than the phenominal Stranger (\"long, long, crazy, crazy tour,\" classic Brent!) the Row Jimmy and Jack A Roe, there weren't really any songs that I was completely stoked to see.  It certainly didn't give us any indication as to the history making set that was to come.  \n\nIn between sets a mop topped Deadhead with a spiral bound notebook and pen in hand came by, interviewing folks and asking them what they thought was going to be played in the second set.  I had heard about a week before that the band had been soundchecking Attics out west, and I had a strong feeling that this was going to be the breakout.  When I told him my prediction, I remember getting a strange look of disbelief as he moved on.  I also remember there was someone up in the lighting catwalks high above the stage with a laser pointer, and he had it right on my chest in between sets.  I grinned and waved at him and he moved it along to others around me.\n\nThe boys came out for set two and we were blown away early.  Playin was funky and amazing, the Uncle John's perfect with sweet harmonies slipping quickly into psychedelic scary jamming back into the Playin reprise.  When those opening notes of Dark Star thundered out, I started jumping up and down like a pogo stick.  I literally jumped out of my shoes.  My buddy Mike had his hands on my shoulders behind me, and if he hadn't held me down I probably would have shot right out the roof of the arena like a rocket ship.  Drums and Space were perfectly appropriate, and the Death Don't brought down the explosive energy in a haunting and profound manner.  Fantasy->Jude, Throwin Stones, Good Lovin' brought us back to the standard set closers of this era with nice energy and a crowd pleasing finish.  The encore was as beautiful an experience as I think I've ever had.  I can't find the words to express what a moment it was for me.  It's such a gorgeous, meaningful song, Hunter/Garcia at their poetic, melodic best.  And the boys nailed it tonight.\n\nAfter the show, everyone was stunned and drained.  As the crowd was letting out of the arena, I saw the guy that took my prediction in between sets, and he pointed at me saying, \"Hey man, you got your Attics!\"  I grinned back at him ear to ear.  I sure had.\n\nThank you, archive, for providing access for \nall to enjoy this incredible, once in a lifetime performance.  Thank you Jerry and the Dead for making it happen.",

Certainly, this is one of the all-time shows, up there with anything from 69, 73, 77, etc., even though some of the playing in the first set sounds a little sloppy, (not to mention the awful chord early in UJB), and Jerry is way too low in the mix at the end of TMNS.  \n\nFortunately, the mix improves for the second set.  The Playin'>UJB>Playin'>Dark Star gets most of the attention, but check out the Death Don't!  The singing is so powerful, so emotional, that even Jerry's wailing lead doesn't match the vocal intensity.  This version is right up there with any performance of this song from 68-69, maybe better!  The gorgeous Attics encore, sung nearly perfectly and almost entirely by Jerry and Brent, is another highlight.",

About 10 minutes before show time a guy with a GD Productions laminate came up to us and sold our entire gang (6 people) tickets for $20 a piece. Best investement I've ever made. Nothing I can say about the show that hasn't been said below. I weasled my way onto the floor at the start of the second set and was standing about 20 feet from Jerry when the Dark Star exploded. Wow! The strange thing is that I remember the floor as being somewhat un-crowded and pogoing like I was at a Ramones show when the first bass lines for Dark Star thumped out of Phil's bass. Nevertheless the Attics made the show for me; I was humming it for weeks after. I ran across a bootleg video of this show several years later, copied it and lost in in a move.

Heard on the radio here in Richmond, VA that \"Warlocks\" tickets were going to be sold at the Richmond Coliseum. The announcer said that this was really the Dead, and you'd better hurry, 'cause they're going fast! When a friend and I got there, Sunday was already sold out - SHIT! OK, we'll \"settle\" for Monday night. Lime green tickets with The Warlocks in gold foil.  I think this was the week previous, and boy was that a hard wait. My buddy's mom drove us down, dropped us at the mall across Mercury Blvd only about fifteen minutes before show time. Had no idea then about the lot scene... We went in, onto the floor just ahead of the sea of microphones and the SBD. Plenty of room. Someone gave us some little blue unicorns, the lights went down and things got crazy. The music was not only heard, but felt. I didn't feel right, but I didn't feel wrong, either. Spent most of the time looking up at the ceiling and the lights, and at one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw in my life - Elizabeth from Tappahannock - i'll never forget her occasionally touching my arm and saying \"they're up there, on stage, not in the rafters\". Little did she know it, but there was something up there in the rafters - I could see the music. At the break, several friends from school found us, they were pretty much in the same boat. Then to blow our minds, one of the teachers from our school walked by, looked at us, and said \"you boys be safe,\" obviously he could see right through us. The lights went down again and the rest is history. I didn't know it at the time, but I witnessed perhaps the best show of the Dead's later career. I sensed that something monumental had happened, because afterwards, people were hugging each other and crying tears of joy. On the way out, the phones were packed with people - I remember one guy saying \"Dark Star, man, Dark Star! I can't believe this just happened!\" The ride home was done in utter silence, we'd just had it done to us good-fashioned. I was hooked from that point on, catching as many nights as possible.  Although Sunday night was awesome as well, i'll always be thankful it sold out and we had to go on Monday night. My first night was a historic night. For the next six years, I caught almost every east-coast Dark Star, even the final in Atlanta 94. I always said that all of that energy at Hampton in 89 turned me into some kind of Dark Star magnet. Thanks to the band for providing me with years of enjoyment and memories. Every time I put this one on, i'm fifteen all over again and life will never be the same.",

The middle night was my first show with the super-hot Scarlet/Fire.  I saw most of the summer and fall tours of 88'.  And a bunch of shows in 89'.  But for some reason which I really cant even remember at this point, I didn't make it to this one, even though a bunch of my friends got tickets and went. As well as I can remember the reason I didn't go had something to do with my girlfriend and how she thought I was ruining my future by missing too much community college to go to all these shows.  I was into her and was trying to take her advice etc.  And I also remember the feeling I got when my friends returned and told me about the show.

Something about an incident at a red carpet inn.... a side trip to some mountain with some crazy lesbians and a giant sack of   funghi at this house where  we we kept running in and out of the house from the lights to the darkness....back and forth....paisleys and fractals like you wouldnt beleive...everybody was on the same trip......this was the night we didnt get in.  memories of a shopping mall near the coliseum some serious mucking about definitely transpired there......chris brocharts? orange bus.....thanks for the kip and the alpaca .  This was definitely the most fun I have ever had in my life. it Simply cannot be matched. Thanks B. Painter wherever you are!\nfunny this run may be the best of the modern era",

I'm pretty sure we expected a break out tune. If you were at these shows they rank in your top 5 i'm sure. The second set blew our minds ...serious. I was behind the drums with a great view of the crowd out front and the band too. It happened in waves that you can somewhat hear on the tapes. As the first notes of Dark Star are struck, the crowd goes nuts. Probably the tapers 1st, seeing that they know best right. Then the rest of us recognize. Cool. The Death Dont, on this night was erie and awesome. But I think the Attics really tore the lid off. Wasn't expecting that. As we exited the venue, it was like no comment needed to be made. We knew we witnessed something special that night. These shows set the tone for what I think are some of the Dead, with Brents best run. 1989 through Brents untimely death at the end of summer tour 1990. For some reason I also have this memory of some sick purple too!",

      "review_text": "WORTH THE JOB I lived in Syracuse which is 800 miles away. I had heard the Dead were playing as the Warlocks and I was working Monday, and wondered how I could make Sunday night and return by Monday. Well, we drove all the way Without tickets (which we never did) and were well aware how difficult scoring a ticket was at Hampton. I had done all of the runs since 85 so I loved the place. However, I knew there was something special about these shows, so I had NO problem driving down for 1 show and come back on Monday. Who liked Monday shows right!\n\n  Saturday: A great start to the day, which was crisp and very cool for Hampton. WE HAVE NO TIX. Tons of people looking for tix. We see a Police car and a bunch of people are surrounding it. We walk up as close as we can and some guy is sitting in the back seat of the Squad car with the door open with a hundred tickets in his hand. All GRATEFUL DEAD mail order produced by Steve Marcus/Calico & Co. I actually bought two tickets for each night out of a back seat of a police car. That's was certainly my best experience that close to any cop car. \n  Show starts and is great! Second set comes around and I yell in my friend Heidi's ear that they are going to play help on the way-Slipknot and Franklins. Everyone overhear's me saying it and laughs. First note jerry makes HELP ON THE WAY. Well, enough to be said about the night before.\n\n   I decided I had to stay for MOnday's show, and would call my boss from the hotel in the morning and tell him I was sick. \n  \n   Monday (today) I call my boss at 6:30 am and tell him I am sick and can't make it in. He tell's me that one of the guys heard I went to see a Dead show. He told me I had 1 hour to be in the office or I was FIRED. Well, we all know I am not making it home 800+ miles from Hampton Virginia in 1 hour. So I lost the job and preyed that tonight's show would be worth my job for the last 3 years. WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK`\n\n    I went into the show and ALL of You were there. Remember in the back of the tapers section on the floor we All sat and prepared for an incredible adventure. There were at least 20 Syracuse area people there and it seemed we were all strapped in and ready for a ride. I have seen the Band 500 times and this was the best Combined audience band experienced I have ever had. There are a few in the 80's that compare, but not for Music content, qaulity, etc. This has 5 stars for being an incredible experience. \n\n  Those who were not there, still say it was noisy and lame. That's because they only heard in on tapes. Believe me, many seasoned heads just could NOT make it to these shows as they were too much of a surprise on most people's itinerary. \n\n   Incredible breakouts of Dark Star, Death Don't have no Mercy and Attics of my life. 17+ years since this had been played which should be as significant as Dark Star. \n\n    The Air was Crackling with Energy that I swear you will never experience again in Rock and Roll. I am into all sorts of music and Phish could never in a million years bring me here. They don't have the routes and history and the power the Dead had. I compare bands like Phish to the Dead like our civilization now compared to Ancient Rome. The Dead are incredible.",

I did my first east coast tour summer of 88. I never thought i would get the chance ton see a darkstar. I ended up seeing 125+ shows from 87 to 94. My last run was the boston garden shows in 1994. The encore that night was broken-down palace and I knew it was over for me. The magic was just gone, and the scene just sucked....but speaking of magic these two shows that I got to see were just incredible. The band was firing on all cylinders. When they broke out darkstar the energy level in the place just went wild. I still didn't believe it was happening, I thought it was a teaser, until jerry started singing it. Incompletely lost it. It isn't even close to be the best darkstar, but it was a darkstar nonetheless. These two shows are magical. I'm only rating it a four star because for me to give a 5 star it has to be an extraordinary show from start to finish. If anyone wants a copy of this show, or any other for that matter just email me. I have well over a 1000 shows and it grows daily. I'm actually starting to get a collection of JGB also.

Don't regret it because I caught a lot of shows before it and afterwards. This was a great time for the Dead and the peak of Brent Mydland's career. Every song is played with such energy that even the flubs make it more interesting. Garcia rips all the way through with Brent encouraging him to take up a notch. Phil is commanding with his presence, Bobby nails every one of his tunes and the Rhythm Devils are firing on all pistons. In other words \"Good Ol' Grateful Dead\" just listen to the Playing in the Band and get ready to go somewhere really nice. This should be released on DVD if good quality video  is in the vault.

To me it's hands down the best version I know of and is one of the highlights of Brent's illustrious career, of which there are many. All time best show?

But When I heard that they were sneaking in two shows as the Warlocks in my favorite place to see the the dead, I had to go.\nWith no tickets, no ride, and all my funds in future or recent dead shows, my prospects were few.  \nI heard it from a head in Memphis that a hotel was selling tickets to the second night only, if you rented a room from them.  I booked first thing and enlisted my friend Kevin for the long bus ride to Va,  We made it there just before the first night and never got tickets.  in the lot, after the show, we heard they brought back Help>Slip.  I was beside myself.\nThe next night inside, during the first set, Kevin looked at me and asked, \"Do you think they have played their hand?\", obviously referencing the great night we had missed. The very next line sung was, \"Sitting plush with a royal flush, aces back to back.\nLet me stop here to point out that I was a Dark Star fanatic.  It all started for me with the version on Live Dead.  Seeing a Dark Star was an ultimate fantasy. \nThey vibe inside of that place that night was unlike anything I have ever felt in my life. \nI arrived with so little money in my pocket, I wondered, after the agony of missing the first night, why I spent all my time following this band.\nBy the time we settled into the middle of Playin',  I knew this was a special night.  At one point, (10:35)  Garcia began to play a riff he played during many Dark Stars from the past, in particular, the one from Live Dead, which was so ingrained in my head.  I Heard it, and thought, \"could it be?\"\nWhen the opening notes rang out, I was peaking.  My friend and I just jumped in unison, while holding each other, for several minutes.\nBy the time we reached the 7 minute mark I was hearing, what I believed to be the greatest Dark Star ever played in my favorite place to see my favorite band play my favorite song, standing Dead Center, Best Sound Ever, hash/shroom..\nOne of the greatest moments of my life.",

Ron was managing a restaurant at the time and said he would come and pick me up when his shift was over. (what a pal). With arrangement made for my car repairs we proceeded to Hampton. He had already procured tickets in advance so we were set for both nights. (except for a few What-Nots and Doo-Dads in the parking lot). The tickets and the sign at the coliseum both read FORMERLY THE WARLOCKS, not The Warlocks.( I just wanted to clear that up. I have the stups to prove it.). Both shows were great, but the atmosphere and energy inside that building when they went into Dark Star was like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. Even the best recordings can not capture that. Words can not express or describe the wave of energy that swept over that crowd and brought every person in there into one accord. It was a religious experience in every sense of the term.

You got Dark Star your first show!?\u201d   I was like \u201cdon\u2019t they usually play that?\u201d  I got punched in the arm really hard.
