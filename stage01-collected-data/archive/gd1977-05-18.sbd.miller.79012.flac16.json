The highlight to me was the exquisite 10 minute jam  out of Estimated that segues into a joyful Eyes intro jam, which clocks 5 minutes even before Jerry sings the first verse. The recording: crisp and effervescent. The band took off at he end of 1974, and came back leaner with a faster tempo and less of the jazzy feel of 1974, yet they never forgot what they were great at. \nThanks Dead, thanks Carlie Miller, thanks Archive!!",

Certainly, a good argument can be made that other periods were better, and I fully respect that position. From my perspective, both musicians offered an important complementary role to the vocals, Jerry's guitar and the rhythm section of the band. Logically, they had to have if you focus in on how good the Dead were throughout the entire time these two were in the band. I saw some great show in the 1980's but, without a doubt, the concerts I went to in the 70's were the best. I've said this before on these pages.....Donna added something to many of the tunes Jerry and Bob sung. That female voice, when it was calm and softly sitting in the background, was an important element of what was going on throughout the bands prime years.",

      "review_text": "Another rebuttal I just had to chime in on the review regarding 80s dead vs. this show.  While there are good shows from the 80s, especially 1980-1982, I just don't see how that period can even be compared to this stuff. \n\nBrent was definitely a talented player and singer but frankly the setlists suffered shortly after he joined the band and a couple years into the 80s Jerry went downhill (some combination of substance abuse and enjoying JGB more than the Dead I would guess).  Add the presence of Drums/Space in every show instead of good songs and they lost me for sure.  I always find myself skipping though shows after 1981 to find the \"good stuff\" while 70s shows I listen to all the way through.\n\nI know there's an element of to each his own but you have to recognize that the furious pace of some early 80s shows was a result of cocaine and often times they were playing way too fast on some songs..so much so that they lost some of the feeling and Jerry 's throat was so numb he couldn't even sing a lot of the time.\n\nThis show is classic, tight, excellent Grateful Dead.  I generally prefer 1972-1975 but there is no doubting that the band was in a peak in 1977 and some of the shows are just unreal...including this one.",

This show has 2 of the all-time great versions of Stella and High Time for sure. I mean you got hot versions of MNS, Deal, Estimated>Eyes and the last sequence revolving around TOO is amazing. Whenever they played certain songs in '77 that were rare (TOO, PITB) they always played it with that extra oomph. \n\nAnd also I know what you guys are saying - I'm a huge Keith fan (not so much Donna) and the 70's are definitely their best decade, but I actually love at least a few shows every year, up until 1994 at least. Honestly I don't think these guys were ever weak at all. Certain times they were more on-point but literally every show I've ever heard, even the ones that overall weren't that great, still had at least one special moment.",

      "review_text": "Classic Performance, Top of May 77 This show has always had me come back for a listen. Whether the reggae-twanged early version of Jack A Roe, the soulful High Time, that bumpity Mexicali with Jerry philling in for Phil's backup vocals, or that intro jam into Eyes, this show is noteworthy for many reasons. \n\nTo add my two cents to whatever was being argued or debated about Donna and Ketih's contributions verses Brent era stuff, I really think its futile to try say that either era was \"better or worse\". \n\nThere are many gems hidden throughout the 80s that many 70s lovers would have dismissed and not listened to. 85', 87', 89', and 90' are all peak years and feature undeniably strong performances. But anybody who says that the Brent band was better than the Keith and Donna band is smoking too much DMT. It's just not a worthy tit-for-tat. The band was younger, more ambitious, and playing longer, more drawn-out jams in the 70s. \n\nIf you don't like Donna's off-key vocals, then there is an argument to be made about how every member of the Dead really actually sucks at singing (none of them have traditional on-key vocals). And Keith did go downhill no-doubt (some shows from this month even display sloppy fills on his part) but listening to his contributions throughout the 70s, and the fact that Jerry had him as part of his band, show that they were integral to the scene, and not to be undermined. \n\nI almost like Keith's often submissive approach to playing, because it allows Garcia, Lesh, and drummers to play more furiously, and as for  \"From the Heart of Me\", I think we all deserved a bathroom break at some point, same goes for \"I Will Take You Home\".

Well here goes......I started in 1973 when the Grateful Dead came to the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.  In high school, I kept hearing about the 3 older students who became famous but went to our school.  Michael Hartman was one of those students (Mickey Hart). I won a raffle that year and the prize was Europe 72 so when the Grateful Dead came to the Nassau Coliseum I went to see them.....they appeared with NRPS on March 19th 1973 and the rest was history.  I spent 22 years on tour and 357 shows later with the full band in the USA - CANADA - AND THE SURROUNDING UNIVERSE.  The one thing I loved to do was to go see them on New Years in San Francisco.  I went every year during the Christmas and New Year's season in the 1980s.  I went for 5 years.   used to go whale watching first in Monterrey Bay for 3 days and then head to San Francisco for the shows.  In 22 years I have a lot of road trips stories (Hells Angels, Dead Heads out on parole from Folsom,  Cheysa Cheysa smokers from Shanghai, hot surfers from Monterrey Bay) Next story.....I added 2 other concerts over-seas 20 years after Jerry died....so my grand total is 359 concerts in 43 years......one of the 2 concerts was Mickey Hart and his band and then I saw a screening of the June 28th show from Santa Clara, California  Fare Thee Well 2015",

I am amazed that these almost five decade analog tapes sound as good as they do. \n\nDid anyone else hear that pin drop during Stella? Talk about mesmorizing a crowd!! Everyone focused on Jerry, not a fucking peep...\nKudos to all involved making this incredible time capsule available to us all. A true blessing we should all never take for granted. I for one are externally grateful...\n\nAnd by the way, Betty Cantor is a goddess and eternal hottie...\nWill you marry me, Betty?  ; )",

Me and Pie Rat and the Gooch were at this show and Gooch totally freaked because he thought he realized everryone at the show was some kind of demon and they were going to kill us. Pie Rat freaked cause he saw ants and spiders crawling all over the place, which may have been true, actually.  From Jack to Eyes I was seeing the stage like a giant book with the lyrics on each page like I was reading it. On the way home I got out my notebook and wrote a humungous epic poem Scorched Earth Lullaby. I later gave it to this girl I liked but she lost it that year at the Cobo show. Everytime I hear Stella Blue I think of her, even though her name was Margie.",
