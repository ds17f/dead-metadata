The main highlight of this show is probably the best musical performances I have ever heard, period. The Playin jam is quite nice with some fast paced jamming from the band and Billy providing the perfect backdrop for the rest of the boys to dance around.  This segues into a short drum solo which leads into Phil opening up one of the best Dark Stars EVER.  This Dark Star should be heard...I really cant describe it.  Dew is up next and contains a very beautiful closing jam that perfectly segues back into Playing.  DEFINATELY GET THIS SHOW!!!",

      "review_text": "Mix is fine, show is hot! To these ears, it's wonderful to actually hear Bobby's contributions to the night's festivities. Just like seemingly every other show from fall 1972, this show is exceptionally played, with hot versions of standard songs, and some great segue-jamming in the 2nd set.\n\nFirst set features lots of ordinary songs, but nearly all played with some extra pep and zest it seems. Things really start to heat up with hot versions of Loser & Jack Straw followed by an absolutely incendiary Big RxR Blues before coming to a screeching finish with yet another hot China > Rider.\n\nWasting not one second, the boys get down to business to start the 2nd set. And I do mean BUSINESS. 1972 was the year Playin' really came into its own, the Dead finding new & inventive ways to jam the hell out of the song almost every single night. By late fall, they had begun toying with using the song to structure entire jams in and around, and this 10-18 show is just such a showcase. Jerry noodles some gorgeous melodies over incredibly strong drumming before letting Billy take over the spotlight for a few minutes, then lets the band jam its way back into...Dark Star? It's a treat to get a hot Playin', and it's a treat to get a hot Dark Star, but in the same jam?! Somebody call a doctor! Dark Star is naturally massive in its own right, with layer upon layer of melody and jam and just the right amount of \"interstellar travel.\" As they sometimes did back then, Dark Star winds its way down into an absolutely stunning and powerful Morning Dew. As the song builds to its incredible climax, Jerry strums harder & harder, only to lead the band back into Playin'!\n\nFolks, this is why you listen to the Dead. The rest of the show is fun and well-played, but it seems as if even the band is spent after that 70-minute jamming tour de force that started the set off. Disc 2 alone is worth the download, get it.\n\nSound: A\nShow: A",

Had tickets for the 17th and the 19th but after the first show didn't leave town knowing that I had to see them all.  Met Bear backstage and he got me in early for this show, had my choice of seats.  Three of the best nights of my life, and this show was the night.  So glad to be able to hear it again after all these years.  \nIt's actually a rather delicate show.  And of course the best bass solo that I've ever heard from Phil.  Highly recommended",

      "review_text": "heavy stuff... everybody knows that '72 is total peak-performance dead, but in a year of stunning shows, this is a real bad mutha. easy top 5 material. bobby is higher than usual in the mix, which actually ends up adding quite a bit to the overall vibe of the show... however, it's phil who will shatter yr brain on this one. he's colossal, and does'nt mind a bit, thank you very much. the first set is pretty darn great thanks to a raw jammin' Bird Song, great versions of Loser, Jack Straw & BRRB. but it's the titanic version of China/Rider that puts it over the proverbial \"edge\". phil is bombing, jerry is peeling off leads like crazy, and bobby is absolutely clutch in the transition jam. his guitar is warm and fuzzy and he's goin' balls out... really nice stuff. but as nice as all of that is, the second set is where the earth stops turning, people stop breathing, and everything in the universe comes to a stand still. the playing>drums>dark star>dew>playing monolith is really without a parallel. it is as cosmic/trancendant/etc. as anything that they've ever played. the segue's are so ON, so perfect, that it really all seems preordained by a higher force. playing starts the whole bugger off, and right off the bat, jerry is just fucking FLYING... it's like a warp-speed mind-colonic. clears you out real good. bringing things down to earth is billy's drum part, but you know there's much more to come... enter dark star. one of my favorites of all time and certainly one of '72's best... the post-verse meltdown is exquisite, and then comes one of phil's most pummelling solo's of all time. he's so heavy and brutal that it'll shake yr bowels loose. he drives the big bad thing straight into a devine \"feelin' groovy jam\" that'll make you smile so wide you can't fucking stand it.... the entry into Morning Dew is'nt one of the power chord, stun-gun ones... it's just jerry picking those notes nice and softly... this version is great, but the real kicker is what in my opinion is theee greatest segue that the dead ever did.... right at Dew's crescendo, without batting an eye, jerry RIPS into Playin' again with a vengance... keith adds a great piano lick as well, and we're off into the great unknown again... this band is untouchable... holy shit. anyway, there is a great Brokedown Palace to mellow things out after all of that, and a mammoth OMSN, which un-mellows things right afterwards(btw, phil shreds on this version)... not much else to say really... a truly great show from a truly great band.",

      "review_text": "Playin' Certainly the playin in the Band is great, 5/26/72 is stronger IMO (shame you cant' stream that one), when it came to jazzy multi layered exploration, Playin' really took flight in Europe and lasted througout, really 77. But great to see it still striving later in  72. I find that playin' themes relate to some of the looser jazzy dark star's and spaces throught 72-74 before Jerry started to colour outside the lines more with guitar, still cool but not as tranquele as in mid72. Same with Bird Song, almost as if they are going noware, but enjoying the ride.  \n   This show has a lot of interesting points, the playin>drums>DS>Dew>Playin is a little november 73 flavour too it, and the jam inside Dark Star that would end up in China>Rider is an early interest. Also great to see Brokedown Palace worked in the end.\n\nhappy to share this and the strand with some good listeners, email me at fieldhouse11277@hotmail.com",

      "review_text": "Membership in the GD Pantheon To those complaining about the mix here...it's not perfect, but two people posted 2 stars due to it. For the rest of you, those two people are out of their minds. Bobby is up in the mix..which in 1972 is a great thing because you get to hear how advanced his playing was. Jerry is too low, although at times it works out just right. My biggest beef is keith being low for the first 2/3s of the show...none of that matters, it's negligible the SBD is B quality at worst. The show being A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ more than makes up for it. \n\nfyi, I rarely give 5 stars...F the mix, this one gets 5!\n\nNice boppy Bertha, nice mix of 74 and 71 styles with a hint of 77 at the \"I had to move.\" Bobby is way up in the mix to our delight. With Bob so high in the mix, this Me and my Uncle really smokes. Just today someone was saying how at times 72 can get to be too much because of just how crisp these boards can get. Well, I do understand that feeling, but this one is filling out just right. Jer is a little low compared to Bob, but def audible. I'm really liking this mix overall. Phil is thunderous on the Don't Ease, and Bobby really pushes it forward which leads to Jerry ripping a second solo. Nice! There is some trouble with staying in tune which shows up during the opening of Mexicali, but Jer drops into those low strings and drives the tune from below, which, to my ears, is when Mexicali moves from standard to kickin'similar to Big River, Cumberland etc...Love Jer digging in low and thick. This could be the work headphones, but keith is way too low at this point. Hmm, I messed around with some levels and I think it probably is the headphones. 72 B.E. Womens are too slow. They just are, song isn't nearly as hot as post 74 versions.  Whoa boy, they got a little ahead of themselves on the BIODTL intro..lets see if they rip it up to make up for it. This Bird Song is fantastic, and I know this will sound crazy, but between the minutes 5-7 I hear waves of the terrapin intro..or maybe it's wharf rat(more likely) but either way, something is there, and even better it is coming from bobby. There is a cut in this bird song, which is unfortunate. Despite the cut, a very fine Bird Song. Certainly not a top 72 version, but strong nonetheless. The following Big River seems to be lagging at the start, lets see how it goes. I'll say this, the second solo really chugs along thanks to the staggered hits from billy and a very percussive but sneaky Garcia. Standard 72 loser, same with Jack Straw. Things have been slow and/or mellow for awhile now and hearing them get ready for Big Railroad has me thinking this one will rip. And get this, oh man, killer big railroad, just killer all way through. Man I wish I could have heard this live. Standard El Paso. Very nice China Cat with a pretty almost reminiscing transition. Awesome 72 Rider.\n\nNow we step out of the unique blend of rock, folk, and jazz and into a genre undefined, un-named, known only as the Grateful Dead in 1972.\nNice Playing here. Real nice playing here!! Concisely played without skimping on the weird. Highly recommended. Bobby is on fire as is keith. I love what's happening just before the 13 minute mark through the playing re-entry. Top notch music. They keep the music rolling fluidly into the short kreutzman solo, that acts as the lead in to the big boy of them all. Dark Star gets rolling nicely before heading into deeeeeeep space. Medieval themes seem to underlay the happenings and it gets to a place that is like spooky, without the being scared part. Their re-entry to the Dark Star theme is marvelous. Not subtle to the trained ear, although I'd imagine very much so otherwise. But regardless of where you want to place yourself, the movement is strong and achingly slow, despite feeling swift. Following the first verse the music immediately veers to a darker place, quickly followed by a lightness, highlighted by quick moving drumming from billy and thick bass from phil, while jer and bob sit way behind and use the separation as a means to build, as their timing comes together the music begins a powerful crescendo..and jerry takes us underwater. It's very pleasing to hear bob up in the mix nearly mirroring garcia's licks a quarter measure behind. They are as two rivals high in the air firing back and forth at each other only to create massive explosions of light and color, not to mention some other not so nice stuff. As the music turns evil phil and billy lay in together on some seriously thumpy hits that are nothing short of frightening. Then they go further and probably made about 100 or so folks at that show run for cover. Phil started taking over the jam earlier but was doing it in a very support oriented way. This ceases and he simply dominates. You'll know what I mean. And just when it can't go anywhere else but home, and inspirational fresh feelin groovy jam, it's whimsical, and fun, the very definition of nature in music. After a long trip, at times frightening, others enlightening, but always serious, they lead out of the fire with the sounds of heaven dancing. But it doesn't stop there, this is revelation, morning dew practically explodes in your ears. And what a Dew. Jerry's singing is just what you look for in a big morning dew finale. And you expect dew to cap it, no, not even close..they literally take a collective nose dive into an erupting volcano. Its just breathtakingly good. As they float around toying with playing reprise the air is thinning out and you can see again, and then wham, eyes closed, arms flailing, out of control cartoon smiles, and bobby screaming over donna to drive it home. The sequence is Playing> Drums> Dark Star> Feelin' Groovy Jam> Jam> Morning Dew> Jam> Playing Reprise. And it is simply one of the best segments of music the band ever put forth. \n\nCan you imagine catching a show like this. To think they just played that and had more to get to. A nicely paced deal, a favorite from the era as most are not nearly so powerful. In fact hearing Jerry's singing on this backed with a tear ass group of licks from weir, and supported by keith pounding his keys, this may be my favorite deal until the late 70s. Wow, great great version. Follow that with an exceptional promised land..even has bobby throwing a Keith before the piano solo, the band is flying off the radar at this point and every note and hit made is just killing the standard 72 versions of many of these songs. \n\nDamn, then to play Brokedown Palace to end things before the encore, I'm sitting here at the end of another day at work and am welling up. Lord knows if I'll keep it together come the last lines. \n\n....next day..so I bet you look and see Saturday and skip to casey jones. I recommend against this course, there is nothing ordinary about this version. Jerry is playing with youthful exuberance and the song shines as a result. Oh and keith, who is really an all star at this show despite my lack of mentioning him, tosses in some great stuff..and then casey jones, which gets rolling with a train thumpiness more akin to 74 than 72, which is fine by me. Why Keith didn't play piano the way he does for the end of this wild and powerful casey jones is beyond me. They kill this one like it's the last time they'll ever play. WOW, JUST WOW..WHAT A SHOW..GET IT, LISTEN TO IT, WHATEVER, DO LET IT PASS YOU BY. \n\n::wipes brow, mistakes dog for beautiful woman, makes out with dog::\n\nSound 7/10\nShow 10/10\nOverall 9.9/10",

I am of course referring to the monster 2nd set sequence of Playing In The Band>Drums>Dark Star>Morning Dew>Playing In The Band that hints of jams to come a year later on shows like 11/14/73 San Diego, 11/17/73 UCLA, and 11/21/73 Denver when the band would use a song like Playing In The Band or The Other One as a base from which to launch a long jam sequence that would revisit the original song, after touching on other songs and then return back to base to wrap things up in fine fashion. The effect is hypnotic and when it's all over you feel you have travelled through many worlds. This is classic Grateful Dead and worthy of a five star rating.",

      "review_text": "wow.... is all i can say about this show. pretty amazing stuff throughout. the quality of the performance makes any small defects or flaws (very few) seem insignificant. This recording almost sounds like a Bear-Board. Someone mentioned him being there. His boards always have the guitars sounding a certain way. Real crystal clear chimey/clangy tones. Dick's Picks 23 at Baltimore Civic Center on 9/17/72 or Dicks Picks 36 at The Spectrum on 9/21/72 are perfect examples of this sound. Also note before they play Beat It On Down The Line you can hear them discussing how many beats to start it off with then they decide on 14. I dont know what Bobby hesitated for after the 14th beat but they always seem to flub the intro of this song and its always funny. listen to this show, it will do your mind good.",

      "review_text": "Bash the mix all you want, this is 5 stars Like a lot of streams on here, this mix is uneven (Bobby is loud and Jerry too low). But this is SOOOO correctible that it's hardly worth mentioning. You can adjust the balance on your receiver toward the left channel -- the Jerry side. Or use a wave editor and just amplify the entire left channel throughout the concert. It gives you nearly perfect results.\n\nI agree with other reviews that this is an exceptionally well-played show. I especially like the Dark Star, but the entire show is impressive.",

This Dark Star is not only fantastic but the back half of the song is one great example of the Dead (specifically Phil) exploring musical themes that would eventually go on to become what we know of as \"punk\". \n\nAs a former punk listener I was pleasantly surprised to hear Phil thumping some very familiar bass lines years before those bass lines were familiar to anyone (much less dubbed as \"punk\").\n\nVery, very good shit here.",

      "review_text": "Fall nienteen hundered seventy two I became aware of this show along with 9/21/72 in 1995 when David Gans & Dick Latvala selected the Dark Stars for The Jerry Garcia Memorial on August 13th, 1995. So when the SB's became available in 1996 I went on a tape trading frenzy trying to seek these gems out. I remember playing those tapes at least 3 times a week for quite awhile. And when this particular show became available on the IA it was downloaded immediately for CD use, I still listen to it frequently. The Dark Star is the obvious standout however the Playin' is not to be missed. After the 9/21/72 Dark Star this is my 2nd favorite DS with 10/28/72 3rd, 11/19/72 4th & 12/15/72 5th so Fall '72 is in this longtime Deadheads opinion the most adventurous & consistent eras of the Dead's entire career. Every show was at least 3 hours long first sets tended to have 12-15 songs and 2nd sets & sometime 3rd sets were long 2 hour jam fests.\n \nSeptember 1972 in particular is my favorite month out of many starting with Boulder, Co 9/3 right thru Washington D.C. 9/30. September 72 packs a whole heap of musical exploration that will be pleasing to any Deadhead.\n\nMaybe someday this show will become a Dave's Picks or a stand alone release as it truly deserves the full treatment. I'll start pestering DL to consider this one I always rally for 12/1/79 to be  released maybe I'll rally for this one instead.\na 5* star show for performance \na 4 1/2* for recording\nA composite score of 9.88\nOh just give it 10 stars all the way.",
