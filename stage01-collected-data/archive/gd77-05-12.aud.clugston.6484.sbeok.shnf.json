      "review_text": "The Story I'm Told OK, this is my first \"review\".  I grew up and lived in the Chicago area until 1986.  Saw all my early shows at the old Uptown Theatre.  In 1984 I met a guy who claimed he helped record many Mid-West shows with a friend of his who owned the taping gear.  Between the two of them they would smuggle in the deck, mics, mics stand etc.  His name was Dave Bushnell.  You out there Dave?  Anyway, his friend (Dave never told me his name) who owned the gear got married in the early 80's and left the Dead scene.  Before parting ways, he gave Dave all the master cassettes the two of them had recorded together.  5/12/77 was one of the tapes Dave turned me on to.  The show posted here sounds exactly like the tape I made from Dave's \"master\" cassette back in '84.  I still have the tape.  The thing that convinced me that it was probably a master (along with the other tapes) was that his copy was an old style Maxell tape.  It had the old Maxell label glued on the cassette so you had to write your info right on the tape.  He also had all the ticket stubs for every show he claimed to record still in the tape case.  Sure, he could have copied the shows from someone else back in the 70's, but he seemed to have some pretty detailed memories of his taping exploits.  He told me that at the beginning of this show, Candice Brightman (the Deads Lighting Operator) spilled coffee on the soundboard by accident which is why he thought Bertha sounded kinda wonky until they cleaned up the spill.  Dave said that, yes, they were having battery problems during the show, but were hoping for the best.  My cassette has the missing Cassidy, but if you think the Not Fade has problems, well the Cassidy is far worse.  That might be why the Archive guru's left it off the download.  But once the song ends, then the tape sounds fine again.  Weird...  Dave also had \"masters\" of 10/29/77, 5/17/77, 1/30/78, 1/31/78, 2/3/78, 2/4/78, 7/3/78, 2/4/79 (more pitch problems in set one) and the three 1980 August Uptown shows. He also said that all the shows he helped tape, they always used his friends Sony TC-150 deck with AKG mics. I know Archive list's other tapers for many of these shows, but Dave always seemed to have a sincerity about him.  I don't think it's a stretch to believe that more than one deck got into these shows.  And all he ever wanted at the time was to just get the shows into circulation, because at that time these shows were still pretty rare.  Yes, 5/12 has it's problems, but the playing that night was way above average, even for '77.  Hope this sheds some light on this often overlooked Chicago show.",

      "review_text": "Still a May77 <br />Not sure why the excellent SBD for this show's never been uploaded on the archive - yet. The show has been officially released twice, first in part on the <b>Winterland June 1977</b> box, which missed the 1st set highlight, Tennessee, but did include the wonderful Mississippi. The 2nd set's fantastic Samson is missing from the SBD sources so you have to go to this AUD. The rest of the show is average (for May '77). Since this came two shows after Buffalo and three before Alabama - two of the greatest shows in history - maybe that's unexpected. It's still the May '77 sound and quality. The <b>Terrapin Station</b> album hadn't yet been released for these punters, so some songs would have been a surprise (ex. AUD reaction to Sunrise). The first of two shows at the ornate theater, the second show is the better show overall (even though most of the six repeated songs are better on this night). That said, my opinion of this show has improved over time by a whole star - it's just very mellow. But it's solid and Donna is much better than usual.\n\nFirst Set. It's a solid set, though average for this tour, with only a few standouts compared to elsewhere in the month. It's played oddly casual, but nice; like the St. Stephen's Bobby-licks in <i>Bertha</i>, and listen to how good he is in <i>Tennessee. Jack Straw</i> and <i>TLEO</i> are a bit flat but the rest is certainly solid - especially the powerful <i>Mississippi</i>.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Samson</i> is a rampaging beast (when it starts  somebody yells \"Alligator!\". In 77!). <i>Brown Eyed Women</i> is good - the set is good because Bobby is so good this night and the drummers are tight. There are a dozen examples of <i>Terrapin</i> on this tour but none seem to match 4/30. The rest is average for May '77 but still solid. The encore centers on Keith.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u00be  stars\n\nHighlights:\nTennessee Jed - one of many top TJs in May '77\nHalf-step Mississippi - opens up huge and Donna is great\nSamson & Delilah - a beast of a Samson\nBrown-Eyed Women - Bobby great\n\nSOURCES: Both the clugston and the Gatto use the same reels but the clugton6484 sounds better and fixes the pitch problems (mostly - the second set is still pitched too fast). A fine SBD circulates, but it's missing the Samson. Officially released on the <b>May 1977</b> box. Eight tracks are also on the <b>Winterland June 1977</b> box bonus disc.",

And if I had to pick just one, not sure it'd be this, although the Not Fade is wild, wooly, and fun listening even with the pitch weirdness.  Donna's even on key.  BTW, don't know what's with the haters, I love Sunrise with tears streaming down my face, and this is a well-sung version.  Only three stars cause it's a barely listenable AUD.",

So much of May '77 has received the official release treatment: Dick's 3 (5/22/77), Dick's 29 (5/19 and 5/21), To Terrapin: Hartford '77 (5/28), Dave's 1 (5/25), May 1977 (5/11, 5/12, 5/13, 5/15, 5/17), and Get Shown the Light (5/5, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9). For those keeping track, that leaves only a remaining six shows from the magical, mythical month of May: 5/1, 5/3, 5/4, 5/18, 5/22, 5/26. \n\nI must say, then, I'm with Mind Wondrin on this: Why don't we have an excellent SBD up here in the archive? I also agree that while there's some standout song performances, this is really just an average May '77 show. In other words, it's very good. Unfortunately, because of the sound issues of this AUD recording, I have to give it three stars. I'd like to listen to this show from the May 1977 box and see if my view changes, but it's hard to listen to this show post-drums. A shame because it's the end of a sweet PITB sandwich (NFA->Comes A Time->Playing reprise). The Terrapin preceding the Playing is a beauty. Otherwise, Bobby sounds excellent on rhythm the whole night-- check him out on Bertha right out the gates!",
