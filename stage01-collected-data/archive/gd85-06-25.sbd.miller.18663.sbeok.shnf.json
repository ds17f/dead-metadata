The Row Jimmy is just dripping with emotion. Very heavy. Definitely a show I cant stop listening too. A good one. And thanks to the folks who make it so easy for us to get this stuff.",

Of course the day tripper opener is fun - not tight but fun - one of those \"the idea was better than the execution.\" Cuyahoga is a very beautiful venue - it is one of those places that are the grounds and facilities are so nicely cared for you just know the they were not totally prepared for 20,000+ dead heads to spend the evening. I don't believe we were invited back. The Sugar Mag was particularly memorable because I remember Bobby running all over the stage and then climbing up on the speakers and sitting on them with his legs dangling in the air all while the band was cranking away. It was a beautiful starry summer night and all in all the show was very nice. I don't know if it is a must-have but it has special meaning for me.",

Wow now thats some powerfull stuff. 85 has allways been a epic year and I have heard alot about this show just never got arround to it. Classic mid 80's Dead, do yourself a favor download this right now!! SPACE is totaly insane so is the whole show the sound is very good esp. for 85. Saw philly 4/8 and the merriweather shows which are great but this one gives me that slaped in the test tube feeling all over again 5+ stars",

I seem to go through phases (as I'm sure many/most of us do) of listening to the Dead hardcore and then easing off a little and listening to any or all other types of music.  When I come back to the Dead, there's always a new twist, a new way of hearing it.

Fine, there were sloppy parts which are impossible NOT to find in any show, of any era, but this is absolutely one of the best shows recorded. Billy and Mickey have complete control of both sets, and the energy from the rest of the band never lets up. And, who can possibly argue with the setlist? Jerry may have been strung out, but the leads on China - Rider and Sugar Mag still make me grind my teeth. Get in touch with me DKingCT1 - it's been way too long.

Good heavens, no. RJ is one of my top ten fave Dead tunes and here it's just butchered lyrically throughout by jerry and is generally played at a snail's pace w/no remarkable licks until the very end w/the repeating of the 'I say Row...\" verses. Fine, if you want to judge the song by its final 3 minutes but the Dead never played this song better then they did when it debuted in the early 70's and this version just doesn't change my opinion on that. \n\nI should also say i'm not one of those 80's Dead show snobs--I saw the majority of my shows between '81 and '89 and attended many of the '85 shows as well, but fail to see how they can compare to anything from '72-'74 or '77 or even '79-'81. \n\nthis Board DOES sound excellent but the playing is choppy and the pristine sound reveals the flaws) and just not as smooth as many many other shows you can find on the archive. \n\nBest you can say is that there are 'moments\", like Jerry's licks in Uncle and big River, but he just about always blazes those. \n\nThe \"energy\" factor is, i admit, evident, and for that i add the extra star to make 3, but otherwise I'd really give this a 2, as I would many shows between '85 and '88 before they resurged with some amazing performances in the summer of '89 right through '91. \n\nsorry for the dissent but I gots to call 'em like I hear 'em. I'm sure i'll face some wrath but that's what makes horse races.",

Rider has an unbelievable jam at the end and is one of the best versions I've heard yet.  Beat It On Down the Line is substandard with a huge flub in the middle.  Row Jimmy and Uncle are average at best but Big River delivers the goods and Big Railroad Blues is smoking hot with some incredible soloing from Garcia.  A short but lively Jack Straw is well played but segues into an uninspired Might as Well.\n\nSet two starts off promising with a rousing rendition of Gimm Some Lovin' followed by a decent China>Rider.  The highlight of the set is Playing which at nearly 17 minutes delves into heavy territory.  This jam is the saving grace of an otherwise average set.  China Doll is sweetly played but the vocal are a bit rough and the Sugar Mags that closes the show is mediocre.  Touch of Grey is a nice choice as an encore but this version isn't one of my faves.  3 and a half stars.",

Jerry in red, he didn't move very much that day, and barely looked up the whole time, even when singing.   But he sure did play.  Was great from beginning to end.\n\n2. Had 2nd row, when you could still camp out at the venue to get guaranteed good seats.  All the seats down front were in the \"pit\", not attached to each other.  So by the 2nd set, we had stacked up most of them and made a big dance area, and ticket shuffled a lot more friends down with us.  SO FUN!!!  Our one friend though had worked construction all day, was real beat, so sat up on one high stack and FELL ASLEEP.  Could NOT believe it.  Maybe that's why Jerry wouldn't look up, lol.\n\n3.  Bobby was extra animated, feeding off the energy of all us crazy dancers, running over and jumping up on Brent's keyboard, playing and kicking and laughing, just having a ball!\n\nThink it was just my 6th GD show, and definitely in my top 3 of 100+.",

Officially.\n\nAlso one of the all time great China Dolls, with a huge extended epic outro > jam where Jerry simply had no interest in leaving the stage.
