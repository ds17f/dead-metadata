      "review_text": "Branford steps in to further move brightly, the  inspiration ! First let me say, that I realize I wrote this in a rather convoluted way, but if you bare with me hopeful it will make sense. Secondly, since I've been trying to repair my reviews, I didn't realize I had two of them up here for the same show? Is that me, that spaced out or did they post it wrong because I have yet to find out how to access the other review. Oh, well!\n     I'm just speculating, when I imagine that it could be possible, and thus not surprise me, if someone were to criticize this performance in such a way, although I've never heard any mention as such, as to be be partial to Marsalis' New York appearances. I was lucky enough to have seen both on the west coast, namely, New Year's in Oakland and this show. Now I've heard and seen in the case of Madison Sq. recordings of the New York shows quite a few times.\n     [If this next section doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I hesitated to make this analogy, since it requires so much off subject explaining. Believe it or not, I omitted facts that lead me to this analogy in the first place.]\n     I also remember perceiving at that New Year's show, despite Branford's presence, the Dark Star as weakest of the five I've seen, mostly because it was short and Jerry's illness of some sorts at the time, reduced his singing ability, However, I did see, on a website similar to this, (which shall be remain nameless, partially because for reasons unknown, that critique or set of critiques, has long since been removed), contradicting my assessment of level of that Dark Star. Coming from someone possessing what I \"normally\", or should I say otherwise, would consider an \"expert opinion\", (since apparently, this fellow had studied in detail, virtually every known recording of Dark Star and The Other One, a category to which, by the way, I don't claim membership).\n     In so reasoning, probably I suspect in a similar way, (but never clarified as to how or why), as I do below, in reference to Eternity here at this L.A. show. I figure that must be kind of like, (since I just re-listened to the following the other day), the Dark Star they played in Miami in '89, (which I didn't attend), where although they really went \"outside\" (see below), Jerry sang very poorly.\n     I say all this, because even though I have heard this and do remember the show as probably the best of the three, I haven't heard it that many times; certainly not as many times as I have the New York shows, nor as recently.\n     Therefore, since I would like to remain credible given that, not only have I seen some bad or mediocre reviews recently, of what remember to have enjoyed, (although my enjoyment was primarily bolstered by a rarity or new tune etc. in a given case), hence, just because this had Branford included doesn't guarantee it's high rating. ie. I'm trying to remain objective since too many times have I found people raving how good they were when I was certain of the mediocrity.\n     Yet, in light of the fact that in general, (which I believe has more to do with my instead of decreasing, as it should have been, increasing lack of the wherewithal to obtain, a recording shortly after a given show, as well as the frequency of how generic many shows were becoming, before the introduction of all, and I mean \"all\", of the then latest, and now obviously, the \"last\" set of new tunes), resulting in my certainty regarding a given show's level of intensity being much greater in reference to early or midway through the period I saw them perform ('76 -'94), than for the later ones. Thus tempering my confidence to the extent, that I should feel compelled to write all this.\n     Having once, at least, wrote an over confident praise of a show I hadn't heard in a very long time, due to the theft of my old recordings; latter to realize I had exaggerated in reference to the performance besides, and in addition to, the sound itself being disappointingly far worse than expected, ie. than what I had originally.\n     What I mean is, indeed Branford was inspiring for most all of us. But just because I was there and so was he, doesn't remove my hesitation to simply claim it's greatness without exception, thus potentially overstating the truth, as I did at least once before.\n     Nevertheless, I'm more confident in my memory of Eternity as being particularly outside, if you will ! (An old jazz bebop expression, a term that gee, I haven't really used in a very long time. Again, I guess Branford being a sax player, brings me back to saying that.)\n     So, rather than continue carrying on adnauseam, my efforts conveying what's generated my caution in applying adulation, almost irrationally so, in reviewing this one; perhaps it is more appropriate for me to reserve that for, (by not reviewing at all), the several late era shows for which, given that having not soon there after obtained a recording, and unlike this one, having a no direct clear cut legitimate reference, with which, despite the total and frequency of my having listened to this being few and far between can be mitigated, namely, Branford Marsalis if, but probably and hopefully not, the only one, since as I said to start with, implying that mutual thing, with which I'm certain you'll familiar namely, that \"inspiration moves me (or we/us) brightly\", and simply shut up, after giving in to say : This one is hot, get the download!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

Very good show, but oh what could have been....The disppointment in the jam into terrapin let us know that there was no dark Star, but check out the post terrapin jam. Weakest of the Branford shows because the boys can't seem to take it to the next level. The fotm is surprisingly short and seems to aburptly end and the NFA has no jamming except for branford's short sax riff. Best part of the show is Jerry cutting of Vince's weak solo in FOTM.\n\nOne other thing of note...the entire first set and the 4 before space are all first time attempts for marsalis. No confort zone here, whic is why it is not as polished as the other gigs",

Although there are times when he plays very well, for the most part he sounds a little off. Bucket has some substantial tempo issues, and Loser's lyrics consist of quite a bit of mumbling and misplaced verses. As well, there doesn't seem to be any major interplay between Jerry and Branford, which is kind of a bummer. I think the same thing happened when Hornsby sat in with the Dead sporadically in 1995 (3-23-95 & 6-24-95 & 6-25-95), Jerry just kind of played the same without really engaging the guest musician. Oh well, you can't expect him to be on and totally enthused EVERY night, can ya? \n\n4 star sound, 3 star performance IMHO. \n\nThe snare in the left channel of this recording sounds like it's miked from about 50 feet away. I don't know whether it's Billy or Mickey, but it's different. I do like the SMR, and the Tom Thumb is sweet!",

No matter how ill Garcia was he should have had the grace to give his guest a shot during Scarlet>Fire.  He committed the same inelegance in '94.  Too far gone to play well himself he couldn't even hear someone who had shown ups chops intact waiting his turn.  Marsalis must have wondered who this rude listless player was and where the hell his old sparring partner had fled.\n\nI owned this as a cassette up until three weeks ago for five years.  It was a letdown from the day it came into my hands.  A wretched audience tape like so many that came my way in the nineties.
