Jack Straw is very nice, Bobby inserted part of his substitute lyrics in this one --- Just an interesting footnote --- it's not \"Used to play for acid\" on this version as noted by a couple of reviewers of the January 11, 1979 show.  A good show, nonetheless, so listen and decide.  I like the sound quality.",

Just got done passin a kidney stone a few days ago...had a few left over vicodin's...\n\nWow, thats the first time I've heard a Scarlet/Fire..especially the transition like that.  It melts every which way, and makes you pulse like the old color blobs behind the stage on the walls.  It literally took control of my heart beat.  Beautifully understated grooves here.\nA+  A perfect mellow and breezy one-two punch.\nOnly part that absolutely BLOWS about this show is that you cannot download it anymore :(.\n\nDid someone REALLY say that Jerry did not contribute to this show?  na, cant be, im not THAT gone.",

      "review_text": "Brent provided some Energy Overall this is a fun show. Brent provided a desperately needed transfusion of fresh blood, and it's especially obvious in the energy level seen during the fall tour- energy that was sorely lacking in the business-as-usual approach of very late '78/early '79.\n\nThis \"Scarlet>Fire\" is both cool and unique, and I've played the hell out of it. However, while it is interesting, I do not rank it among the truly elite versions of that combo. Long doesn't necessarily equal good, and I agree with the sentiments expressed earlier that the transition jam sort of loses it's way after an interesting start. \n\nI downloaded this a while back but just got around to posting about it. I'm not a big one for griping about the loss of soundboards here- we made due before and we'll make due after - but this is an example of where it does seem a bit heavy-handed. If they were going to use this show, they'd have released more than the portion we got on DP 13 (and even that part had to faded in because of tape problems). In other words, if they're done with it, why not let people have what's left?",

Previous folks have reference that the Scarlet>Fire transition \"loses its way\", but I cannot disagree more.  The jam goes into territory that is not typical of others, true, but taken as an individual performance, it is truly amazing.  I agree that Jerry's voice is not great here, but he and band more than make up for it with their playing.  The Playin' is mellow, long, and extraordinarily trippy. For me, I can give this show no less than 5 stars, but that is just me, listen and judge for yourself.",

The transition and jam is unlike any other version i've heard, and it flows great. The best jams, IMO, lose their way in one form or another. Like a good Deal, or a good other one, let it grow, hard to handle etc. they just get crazy and u dont know whats happening them BAM!!! they jump back into it and you've never felt better in your entire life. This scarfire really takes that jam to the next level, and brent is as crisp as a fresh cut lawn, just devine. top 3 scar>fire, all time, without a doubt.",

Who knows, it may even be the best ever. I've never heard a jam like this in the transition into Fire. It's an amazing soundscape guaranteed to send you places you never imagined.\n\nIt should also be noted that this Scarlet-Fire is a hidden track on Dick's Picks 13- A Nassau show from '81.",

They were just getting into gear with Mydland, and I liked him much better than Keith & Donna. Of course, I only saw them once in '78 during their decline.  Keith was great in the early '70's, but I think I remember him falling asleep at the first show I saw. Most likely to much heroin flowing round his brain, or he was just bored (most likely some combination). At least Jerry could stay awake the whole show when he was binging!!",
