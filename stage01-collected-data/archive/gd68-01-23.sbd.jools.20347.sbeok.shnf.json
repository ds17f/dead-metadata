Similar to Quicksilver's \"Gold and Silver\" in its time signature and softly loping feel. \n\nBut in all the versions in this archive \"Clementine\" never quite jells into a really good song. Half the band usually plays much too busily while the other half plays tastefully and true. And it's tough to play a two-chord bounce for very long without the song becoming boring.\n\nIt's a shame.

The eerie Clementine and beautiful New Potato make this one of the most underrated shows of their 30 years.",

      "review_text": "The Two-Chord Bounce \"Clementine\" is simply an idea that never got developed into a song.  The two chords allow for some interesting jamming and a change in dynamics, particularly in transitioning out of the \"Cryptical\" reprise.  But the words are, well, not Hunter's best.  \n\nNevertheless, virtually anything from this period is golden.  With the \"Other One\" suite, \"Dark Star,\" and \"The Eleven\" mixed in with Pigpen's R&B, the Dead created its own unique inimitable music.  How many band can you really say that about with a straight face?\n\nFor me, though, the band never had a sustained period of passion and originality to match 1967-1970.  True, there were some fine songs and lengthier pieces that showed what the band was capable of (\"Terrapin,\" \"Help/Slip/Franklin's,\" and \"Eyes of the World,\" for example), but they never lived up to these early years.  \n\nI think Phil Lesh may have nailed it in his book when he talked about how the drugs the once helped glue their experiences together ultimately alienated the band members from one other.  No matter how much Phil tries to spin things positively, the story is totally tragic.\n\nBy the way, for a better example of how to make a very good song out of a bouncy, two-chord jam, listen to the Allman Brothers' \"Dreams.\"",

I like the one on 1/20/68.\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-01-20.sbd.clugston.5181.sbeok.shnf\n\nOverall, enjoyable.
