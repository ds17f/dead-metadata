Pigpen is laid up on the west coast and a newbie is thrown to the wolves. Keith comes through with flying colors. Not only does Keith play killer piano, he also plays a unique organ style, not unlike T.C. \nThis recording is pre-FM and features a much better sound than the thin FM recording. I highly recommend this show.",

      "review_text": "Where are we? Mileage varies ... my personal opinion is that this show sounds exactly like you think it would: sort of half-way between what the band was prior to Keith and the international legend-making  juggernaut they would become in another six months.\n\nThe most interesting performance by far has to be the version of The Other One which simultaneously looks forwards (sounding midway through like a Playin' from the summer of 1974) and backwards (e.g., at 11:00 or so when they rock hard on the trademark 2-13-70 \"escaping\" riff).\n\nOne thing that keeps me from really loving this particular mini-era (late '71) is the mix of tonalities and instruments doesn't seem quite \"figured out\" in the way that it will be by the time they leave for Europe.  I mean, Keith is all over the place with the keyboard sounds and it makes the performance seem more scattered than schizoid.  And Phil's bass sounds \"smaller\" to me than he should ... overall the mix is probably a tad heavy on the vocals.\n\nIt's also worth listening closely to Billy's drumming during the last half of the Cryptical.  He can manage quite well by himself!  No surprises there.\n\nAnd how often does Jerry sing falsetto?  Comes A Time, peeps.  Only love can fill.",

They\u2019re a young band with some personnel changes (No Pigpen this show, Keith\u2019s first show, first show with out Mickey), but IMHO this is the start of them really coming into their own, peaking in 1974.  I\u2019m a fan of the one drummer era and it\u2019s great to hear them at the very beginning of that endeavor.  I give this show 4 stars for performance and 4 for sound quality.

The Dead were high on cocaine and played for 6 hours without a break. The audience was equally high. It was an indoor Minnesota Woodstock. Frisbees, balloons and soap bubbles flew or floated came down from the upper balconies of the grand old Northrop Auditorium. While the Dead didn't eat or drink, we did - people ordered dozens of pizzas delivered. Ripple wine, big joints, and chocolate magically appeared -take a hit and pass it on.

I\u2019ve really been going through every MN show because for some reason they often have some really incredible moments that often go under the radars of most Live-Dead-listening Deadheads, so with that in mind, it\u2019s always worth checking out Minnesota shows (08/06/82 St Paul Civic Center for one of 31 examples of MN shows). In fact, MN is home to a lot of uncommon knowledge historical-Grateful-Dead significances, Bobby first met his future wife at one (some say the one mentioned above, otherwise it could be 06/25/83 at that same venue, unless it was the Metrodome show of 06/26/86, but anyway) you know the lyrics \u201cI met her accidentally in St Paul, MN\u201d. \n\nNow getting to this night, of 10/19/71, as some of you may know, this is the show they debuted Keith Godchaux as their new keyboard/piano player for his first ever live show with the band here at Northrop Auditorium in the heart of the University of Minnesota campus, and what a brilliant 1971 show this is if you haven\u2019t already listened to it, because not only did it debut Keith, the keyboard player that would go on to capture and express some of the greatest sounds of their 70s exploratory sounds and visions (1971-1979). But it also happens to be the show where they debuted some of the most essential songs in their repertoire. In usual Dead fashion, they debuted SIX (6!) NEW original Grateful Dead songs on this beautiful historic night; those six songs are: Tennesee Jed, Jack Straw, Mexicali Blues, Comes a Time, One More Saturday Night, AND Ramble On Rose!\n\nIncredible to think that those all made their live debut performances on this night. I think that is among the top 2 or 3 shows with the most actual original debut performances by the band, the other I\u2019m aware of being 02/09/73 with: Row Jimmy, Loose Lucy, Here Comes Sunshine, TLEO, Eyes of the World, China Doll, and Wave That Flag. Not sure if that\u2019s the most and 10/19/71 is the second most or what but my data is telling me so. Someone else may know more, but yeah there\u2019s a great playlist out there of every original love song debut performance and it has a list of all the dates and songs and honestly it\u2019s like catnip to me, check it out. \n\nAnywho, as you can tell by how hot we all generally accept and know 1972 to be, between the famous Europe tour and the Veneta Oregon show (and MANY others, those just being the most \u2018famous\u2019), you know that this band is building their arsenal here in 1971 and you can hear it in beautifully creative performances like these in 1971. Most if not ALL of the \u201cSkullfuck\u201d/Skull N Roses/self-titled-Live album are from 1971 shows, and they are building some serious steam by this point in time for those of you who know. For reference, because I know this stuff interests me, I know it interests many of you too; some other Original (not-covers) songs to debut in \u201871 (earlier in the year, one later) are: \n2/18/71 - Bertha, Loser, Greatest Story Ever Told, Wharf Rat, Playing In The Band\n2/19/71 - Bird Song, Deal \n7/31/71 - Sugaree, Mr. Charlie \n8/24/71 - Brown Eyed Women, Empty Pages, \nThen on 12/31/71 was the first Chinatown Shuffle. So 1971 was a very productive year for the band. 'The More You Know!' and as we know, Knowing is half the battle! Lol idk\n\nWith that being established and known contextually I have to admit that this is 10/10 show for me, sure there is some imperfections, but that\u2019s what I like about it, I wouldn\u2019t want it to be perfect, reality isn\u2019t perfect, and this is one of many examples of how that can be a blessing rather than a detriment to a show, in the end though, I wasn\u2019t there nor born then, but I wish I was so I could have been here (or for any shows in those early days)! And so I\u2019m just truly grateful to be able to enjoy it today here in the 21st Century. \n\nGrateful Brothers and Sisters out there ... Share the love, be a person of compassion, and empathy too. And let\u2019s change this weird and wild world into the one we truly want to live in, be that change you want to see in the world. We need more awesome people like you all (those groovy enough to even be listening to an Oct \u201871 Grateful Dead recording! I mean come on, face it, you\u2019re cool!) this fear filled hate-bait world needs more love and we\u2019re the type of people grateful enough to turn on that love light and let it shine all over the eyes of the world, unlimited devotion and all. Alright, I\u2019m rambling now, going to get back to groovin\u2019 to these tunes! \n\nNFA (~);} 2404",

Best night of my life, indeed.  If anyone out there has a photo of the Dead on stage that night--I'd give anything to see it and everything to have a copy.  The music was so good, the vibe in Northrup was perfect as was the acid.  Truly a sunshine daydream.  And yeah, Jerry playing with the New Riders!  Need I say more?",
