According to Steve Parish's book Home Before Daylight (p. 201), Jerry took four valiums thiry minutes before this show and the first sound out of his guitar was SPRRRROINGG!  Unfortunately, Don't Ease Me In fades in on this tape so we'll just have to imagine what that sounded like.  This isn't a good show by any means, but better than I'd expected based on Parish's account.\n\nOne star for overcoming chemical adversity, or at least battling it to a draw.",

Accd to Mountain Girl in the Robert Greenfield book, Dark Star-An oral bigraphy of Jerry Garcia, she claims Jerry was allergic to valium, which is what almost killed him during the coma in 1986.\n\n\"Because he'd been thrashing around pretty good in the hospital, they shot him up with Valium to get him to lie still for the catscan. Jerry was allergic to valium.  They killed him.  His heart stopped.  He died. The hospital did not want anyone to know this but he died. They had to resusitate him, put him on a respirator, give him a bunch of zap, zap, zap.  Code Blue...\"  p216-217.",

      "review_text": "Not sure what it was like live, but as a listening experience, it's not bad at all... Apparently, I should attack this show with caution due to the entertaining myths that have survived to land in Parish's book. Anyways, the first three songs go down the throat without any sickly bumps. \"Mama\" is dedicated to who? Jack starts out uncertain and non-distictive but soon Jerry puts his imprint on it. \"LLR\" has some unlistenable clunky moments, but it's performed with above-average might. \"TLEO\" is standard. Please, please change the arrangement soon to the 'All New New Minglewood Blues.' This type feels shoved down my throat. \"Stagger\" is  trudgingly paced tho generally well-performed. \"Dancin\" is curiously spaciously empty for an attempted epic. The movement into a \"Drum\" break recaptures my attention which deftly segues into a fine \"Miracle.\" \"Bertha\" closes this first (?) set nicely. \n\nI'm not sure what's missing, what set \"Dancin\" was performed in, heck...what night this was I heard, But, it's not the disaster alluded to by the previous writer. The myth may be true, but it makes Jerry that much more of a 'man' if he was able to withstand the powerful presence of a tab and play a decent show to boot. Discipline I could never muster...",

      "review_text": "First Don't Ease since 1974 This show is notable for the revival of Don't Ease Me In, the first since 1974. And it's a rocking, tight version with a rippin' vocal from Jerry. Also notice that the band is starting to rework the set list and the order.\n\nThis show is better than most of the 5-star-rated shows of the 1990s and mid '80's. The reviewers below give this 1 star because of a rumor of Jerry being high--as if that never happened before. One has to wonder if they even heard this recording. Listen to this show and compare it to others -- Jerry plays some fast and articulate guitar here, as in Jack A Roe. His voice is clear and powerful, and he delivers the notes, nothing like the slurred speech of some later shows--shows where Bob can't hit the notes as well. Here, Bob sounds great.\n\nThe main problem with this stream is that so much of the second half of the show is missing. We don't have Cassidy, Peggy-O, The Music Never Stopped, Scarlet Begonias-> Fire On The Mountain, or Black Peter, Good Lovin', U.S. Blues. I hope the rest of this show surfaces somewhere.",

      "review_text": "carbondale mystery What really happened in carbondale is a mystery still. I am the source of the 90 minutes of music that does exist and how that came about is an interesting story. I caught up with the tour in KC two nites later. My buddy had flown out from the east coast ahead of me and was at carbondale with a deck but no mics. He could find no one to patch into. He does remember some strange sequence but was otherwise distracted and not paying attention to the show. Anyway, two days later after the first KC show, my somewhat connected buddy arranged us a ride back to the hotel with some of the crew. On the way one of the ultrasound crew asked me to run him a copy of that nites KC show which I had taped. He handed me a 90 minute cassette to put it on. That cassette turned out to be the master SBD of the 1st set at carbondale. Any SBD was a very rare treat in those days. Needless to say I didn't record over it. I still have the master cassette, but I did send a copy back to Dan Healy so the band would have it to archive. I have not listened to the stream posted here, but all of the set lists are wrong and/or suspect. The Bertha has a cut in it but on the master tape it actually comes to an end, followed by Bobby's \"we're gonna take a short break\". Bertha ended the 1st set! It was not followed by Good Lovin and did not close set 2. If the end of Bertha is not included here I could upload it if someone helps me with the technical aspects. Because of the way I came to possess what, after nearly 30 years, remains the only record (albeit partial) of carbondale I have always taken an interest in finding a full copy or accurate description of the show. My quest remains unfulfilled. I have not read Parish's book but it makes sense that the band veered into drums in the 1st set to give Jerry a chance to rebound. He started off very strong but you can sense the change later in the set. Anyway, there's a bit of minutia for those who might be interested. Peace Tom F",
