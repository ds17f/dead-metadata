This, to me, is a far cry better than the acoustic sets of two years later.  This is very raw and straight forward, as opposited to the later rehearsed sets.  If it weren't for the newer songs, I've had played this all night waiting for Pigpen throwing a little harmonica and letting us know he was a Kingbee.  If anyone found this last year, before the embargo, let me know how, or if, a copy of this be obtained.  Let me know:\ndawhip@optonline.net\nMere words could never express my gratitude.

One of those things where you would have to be in the right spot at the right time . . . anyone have a time machine? \n\nSome tunes in here that many newer fans will not recognize . . . they really point back to the roots of the musicians and the dead.  IMO much more raw and real then the 80\u2019s acoustic sets at Radio City and the Warfield, here they are just playing for fun.  Kinda reminds me of some later Garcia, Grisman and Kahn et al. shows.  \n\nFantastic sound quality with great banter between the group and the crowd in this intimate setting.\n\nDefinitely worth a listen, but I wish it was still downloadable.

      "review_text": "Holy Shit. This is way cool. Knew they busted out a 1978 acoustic set from the liner notes on Reckoning. Both Tom Dooley and Deep Elem were included in the Reckoning bonus disk from this nite.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this show seems to be more of a random quick call where they put a show together with Jerry, Bobby, and Mickey (don't hear any Phil) before their full on Dead performance later that nite. What integrity these guys have, always playing for the fans who seem to be digging on it and wanting more and more. The acoustic thang would be perfected in 1980 with a full band (glad only the boys are here that nite, no Donna, this was a boys nite.)\n\nMentionables outside of those released on Reckoning diks include a slick K.C. Moan, Knockin' on Heavens door with Bobby slide and heys actually killing it! Oh Boy is a treat reminiscent of those 71' acoustic sets. Pete is the highlight of the set with a folkie tradition of storytelling gone-dead. Everything else is on as well.\n\nIt is great to hear Garcia as on as Bobby vocally and even tho this show is billed as \"Bob Weir Band\" Jerry is just as much in on the fun. \n\nAnyone got this SBD? If so, I have a rare acoustic set that I would share in exchange. dylan.muhlberg@colorado.edu",
