      "review_text": "It's Like Baseball Its like baseball. It amazes me that after watching baseball my whole life I still once in awhile see some play or situation I have not seen before. Such it is with the GD, only it happens more often. I have been downloading for two years and a fan since 12/31/71. The second set of 10-18-78 has new unseen plays, at least for me. For that reason alone I would download it. But first and very important, the sound is very clear and all instruments and vocals are heard, and it is loud.\n\nOne thing that makes the second set unique, like an error, is that it is one of the few times that I have heard Terripin Station messed up. It has always suprised me how correctly it was usually played, given their history of forgetfulness. At 2:38 Jerry gets lost and starts meandering into foul territory lost. Skwimite below states it best; \"Terripin lyrics are flubbed, and the whole piece is oddly tentative and confused, yet endearing.\" Skwimite must be a girl or a very sensitive guy. They do get back on track after a couple of minutes and it becomes its normal greatness. And it is loud and powerful. I don't agree with the aforementioned smart girl/sensitive guy Skwimite that \"PITB suffers the same fate vocally.\" It seems fine to me. What is unusual is 8:20 into it Garcia is on his own and it does some interesting and unique work.\n\n\"Drums\" and \"Space' are very interesting and unique also. I guess someone is playing a harmonica. It is too early for Jerry to be playing the flute.\n\nI agree with StrawRider that in some ways 1978 hands 1977 its hat. 1977 was a follow up to the very slow 1976. 1978 started to rock hard. I guess it depends what you like. All I remember was I was dancing my ass off and at the end of the concerts was screaming my ass off. And that was at Winterland, SF. Infact I am screaming right now in my little brain because I still love the music and can't believe that it still interests and \"excites\" me. \n\nSamson and Delilah is great. That is one of the few songs I remember the first time I heard it played, at Winterland. Tear this old building down. I thought, no not Winterland. I love this place. Please don\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t tear it down Bobby. Wharf  Rat is rockin great. What makes things really unique is Truckin ends the concert. I can't recall ever seeing/hearing that happen. And it works great! What a great job they did. It is played like a concert closing song. I am listening to it right now for a second time and I am speechless.\n\nWow......Truckin' is over now. I can talk. Probably the best Truckin' ever, for me. Too strong of a statement? Listen for yourself. If you agree send me a happy thought. Finally, the encore is a very early \"I Need A Miracle.\" This is very unique for two reasons. Numero Uno, it is the encore song. Numero Two-o, it was done with Keith and Donna. Because I am a Keith and Donna lover, not basher, I really enjoy this version. Donna really does a great job on it. The way they ended it is unique and works out as a great encore song.\n\nNeedless to say.... 5 STARS! If you agree with this review don't forget to send those Happy Thoughts! \n\nElvis is alive, \"excited\", and at times speechless.",

Everything is well played but the set list choices results in a boring first set of plodding, portentious songs. I find it rather too easy to reach for the \">>\" button  and skip over the aimless 7 minutes of \"Peggy-O\" and other lethargic songs. The Second set picks up considerably and is more interesting and well played. Trucking is inspired. Terrapin derails with a rare Jerry flub. Overall, a decent concert with superior soundboard quality. Nothing special, material-wise. However, I notice that most reviewers here have given this show a 5-star rating.

Bob, Donna, and Jerry do a fabulous Looks Like Rain. Listen to Jerry on Minglewood, playing counterpoint to Bob's perfect vocal. Also check out Music Never Stopped (again, powerful extended Jerry solos), Samson, Terrapin (an excellent version, even with the flub), Truckin', and I Need A Miracle.\n\nFrom The Heart Of Me is not good here. A weak song to begin with, and Donna has sounded better. I also don't care for the Drums from this period, and this one is typical. But these are easy to skip, and the recording sound is great.",

      "review_text": "That baseball analogy Grateful Dead Concerts Are Like Baseball Games \nby David Gans\n\n \n\n        The following is the text of [Gans] famous Baseball Analogy as it appeared in The Official Book of the Deadheads (Grushkin-Bassett-Grushkin, Quill, 1983). It was modified somewhat from the text I submitted, and if [he] ever find[s] the original [he] will replace this with that. -- D.G.\n\n \n\nGrateful Dead concerts are like baseball games: no two are ever alike. The plays are always different, and there's always fresh hope. Sometimes the game's an all-timer even though individual performances are sloppy; sometimes everybody plays great but the team loses anyway.\n\nSome people thrive on yesterday's moments, and aren't too keen on the way the game's played today. Some have only been fans since last year and don't care what happened way back when. You can cherish the great victories and triumphant seasons and chart them across decades, or you can go simply for the enjoyment of tonight and to hell with the standings. Like all the great teams, the Dead have their pennant years and bleak innings, perfect games and whippings, hits and foul balls, heroes and goats.\n\nTo many they're an institution, to some mere child's play, and to others the Grateful Dead is more or less an indispensable part of life. There are those who say the game's too slow, that the brief moments of action and excitement are too few and far between. Like \"America's Favorite Pastime,\" the Dead are both celebrated and criticized, and some people will never see what's to enjoy.\n\nLike big-league fans, Deadheads are as varied as the game is long. There are scorekeepers who record every detail for statistical analysis and a place in the Hall of Fame; camera buffs and video freaks; armchair umpires, die-hards, groupies. Some are bleacher bums who'd be in the stands no matter who was playing; and there are even spousal fans who go because if they didn't, they'd be left home alone. A lot of people attend because they've always gone and really don't care to stop.\n\nIt may take a few visits to grasp the subtleties, but if you let yourself into the flow of things, there's something to enjoy from the very first moment you're there. As the old saying goes, the mind believes what the mind believes: Grateful Dead is cerebral if you choose to analyze it, but it's basic and instinctive too. Like the game of baseball.",

In the second set, Heart of Me is very nice, I would call it a best of. I like that song in a way that I don't like Sunrise.\n\nLots of good stuff going on here, but not quite enough for 5 stars. 4.5, maybe, but not 5.",

There's just something about it. Great show throughout. Whole show is crisp. Other standouts: Sugaree, Truckin', Samson, Big River. Nice sound. Give it a listen.",

Whenever I hear them I feel happy and excited, and their music has been a better anti-depressant than that sht the doctors give out. This show from what iv'e heard on this recording is amazing. Of coarse it isn't the best, but I believe there isn't a best show, just many favorites. This is a stellar recording and should be in everyone's collection.",

This is not significant by dead head standards, but is more for me than any other major band though I have seen individual symphony orchestras more often.\n\nSo I was at this and it was not too long before WL closed.\n\nWow one of the most 'convincing\" Wharf Rats, I have EVER heard!",

      "review_text": "Totally weird \"Lady With a Fan\" first guitar solo break Garcia starts singing a verse, forgets the words halfway into the first line, then gives up and starts soloing. He seems lost for the first run-through, but then instead of going back to another verse he keeps soloing. I think when all is said and done the solo break is 4 times longer than normal. \n\nThe final run-through of this extended break is super-quiet. It's just garcia and a single thumping bass drum and everybody else is super quiet. Suddenly the whole break seems coherent and tightly integrated, as though all those stumbles and errors were part of a longer process of developing something totally rad where Garcia normally just always played a fairly set solo\n\nCool show all around.",
