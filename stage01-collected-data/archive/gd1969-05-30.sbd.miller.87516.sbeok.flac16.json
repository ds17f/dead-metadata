Four and 1/2 bones for freshness!\n\nThanks Charlie!\n\nIt's a brave new world!",

Turn On Your Lovelight - 17:33\n\nTypical bootleg, TOYLL cuts off because the tape runs out. Watch out for the \"screamer\" during TOYLL.\n\nA wild and crazy show from May 1969. LSD had not been illegal for very long when this show was performed. It's possible there were a few individuals with altered states of consciousness at this show, on stage and off.\n\nI'd call it a \"Must Have\" show for 1969. I got it, you should too.\n\nEat, Drink be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nThanks for the love.\n\nPS: Click on Charlie Miller's name and get all his GRATEFUL DEAD shows, he has impeccable taste.",

It stands up there with the best of '69...I guess the run immediately following it in June tends to distract people.\n\nThe sound quality is superior for a '69 recording. Highly recommended!",

I got the address from a gentleman who wrote a review of this show and posted it on his website.  Well, sadly, the sight where the Inn was is now the home of condo's.  The front entrance of the condo's is the general area on the block where beautiful music was made on 5/30/69. Pretty neat because the Dead only played there twice...in East Portland of all places.  Lastly, sweet little Cosmic Charlie between DS/SS/TE.",

      "review_text": "Giving the Dead a ride after the show, with groovy tires! I was one of the first to get to the parking lot at Springer's for the show.  We (Nancy, Greg & myself) got there early so I could get a parking spot in the small parking lot in front of Springer's.\n\nWe watched a great show, danced till it hurt & danced some more.\nSince we were one of the first vehicles to get there, we would be one of the last to leave.  As I'm starting to back out of my parking spot, the whole band, with their girlfriends, are walking by.\n\nI joking say,as I'm leaning out my window \"Hey Jerry, you need a lift?\" & to my surprise, he answers \" Why yes, our van is parked about a mile up the road\".\n\nI was driving my 1940 Chev Sedan Delivery, with running boards along the side. The band & the girls climbed inside or on the running boards & we made it very slowly thru the crowd to their vehicles.\nWhen the group was getting out,  Pigpen pointed out to me that with all the weight from everyone, my fenders had been riding on the new tires in the back.  Of course I told him that it was fine because I had just had the whole band in my 40 Chev & would have those memoirs with me the rest of my life.",

I recommend Michael Lydon's interview, \"Dead Zone\" published by Rolling Stone (August 23, 1969) for some prose that adds to the enjoyment you'll get from this show.  \n\nThe recording is excellent - thank you Charlie Miller!  You can hear some hiss, but it's 1969, and I didn't notice after a minute or two.\n\nThe stand-out tracks for me were Doin that Rag and The Eleven, but I don't want to impose my taste on you - have a listen for yourself!  Or your selves...  Or maybe it's your self-es...  Nice to hear the stage banter.  I wonder how the songs would have been different if Jerry hadn't broken all those strings?  \n\nThanks to everyone who make it possible for me to hear this.",

      "review_text": "Show review from RS 40 Copied from an interview, published in Rolling Stone magazine, 8/23/69, written by Michael Lydon.\n\n\"The dance is at Springer's Inn, about 10 miles out of town, and they start out about 9:30.\nA mile from the place there is a huge traffic jam on the narrow country road, and they stick\nthe cars in a ditch and walk, a few fragments in the flow to Springer's under a full yellow moon.\nThe last time they played Portland they were at a ballroom with a spring floor that made\ndancing inevitable. But Springer's is just as nice. It's a country and western place, walls all\nknotty pine, and beside the stage, the Nashville stars of the last 30 years grin glossily\nfrom autographed photos, \"Yours Sincerely, Marty Robbins.\" \"Love to Y'all, Norma Jean.\"\n\"Warmest regards, Jim Reeves.\" \"You got an even bigger crowd than Buck Owens,\" says\nthe promoter, and Jerry grins. It is sardine, ass to ass, and drippingly hot inside. \nIt seems preordained to be a great night. But preordination is not fate. It comes to the elect,\nand the elect have to work to be ready for it. So the Dead start out working. Elation will come later.\nMorning Dew opens the set, an old tune, done slow and steady. It is the evenings foundation stone,\nand they carefully mortice it into place, no smiles, no frills. Phil's bass is sure and steady.\nBill and Mickey play almost in unison. Then Bob sings Me and My Uncle, a John Phillips tune,\nwith a country rocking beat. They all like the song, and Bob sings it well, friendly and ingenuous. \nBack to the groove with Doin' that rag, but a little looser this time. Jerry's guitar begins to sing,\nand over the steady drumming of Bill, Mickey lays scattered runs, little kicks, and sudden attacks.\nPhil begins to thunder, then pulls back. Patience, he seems to be saying, and he's right.\nJerry broke a string in his haste, so they pull back to unison, and end the song. But Jerry wants it bad,\nand is a little angry. \"I broke a string\", he shouts at the crowd. \"So why don't you wait a minute\nand talk to each other. Or maybe talk to yourself, to your various selves.\" \nHe cocks his head, with a glint of malice in his eyes, \n\"Can you talk to yourself? Do you even know, you have selves to talk to?\"\nThe questions, involute and unanswerable, push the crowd back;\nWho is this guy, asking us riddles, what does he want from us anyway? \nBut the band is into, I'm a King Bee, by that time. They hadn't played that for a while,\nbut it works, another building block, and a good way to work Pig into the center, to seduce him into \ngiving his all, instead of just waiting around for Lovelight. Jerry buzzes a while, right on schedule,\nand the crowd eases up, thinking they were going to get some nice blues. The preceding band\nhad been a good imitation BB King, so maybe it would be a blues night. Wrong again.\n\"Play the blues,\" shouts someone in a phony half-swoon. Mickey shouts back, \"go hear a blues band\nif you want that. Go dig Mike Bloomfield.\" Another punch in the mouth, but the moment is there,\nand the audiences stunned silence just makes the opening gong of Dark Star more ominous. \nIn that silence music begins, steady and pulsing. Jerry, as always, takes the lead, feeling his way\nfor melodies, like paths up the mountain. Jerry, says Phil, is the heart of the Dead. It's central sun.\nWhile they all connect to one another, the strongest bonds are to him. Standing there, eyes closed,\nchin bobbing forward, his guitar in close under his arm, he seems pure energy, a quality like, \nbut distinct from, sexuality, which, while radiating itself outward and unceasingly, and unselfishly,\nis as unceasingly and unselfishly replenished by those whose strengths have been awakened by his.\nHe finds a way, a few high twinging notes that are in themselves a song, and then the others are there too,\nand suddenly the music is not notes, or a tune, but what those seven people are, exactly. The music \nis an aural holograph of the Grateful Dead. All their fibers, nuances, histories, desires, beings are clear.\nJerry and his questing. Phil the loyal comrade. Tom drifting beside them both on a cloud.\nPig staying stubbornly down to earth. Mickey working out furious complexities trying to understand\nhow Bill is so simple. And Bob succumbing inevitably to Jerry and Phil and joining them. \nAnd that is just the beginning, because at at each note, at each phrase, the balances change, each testing,\nfeeding, mocking, and finally driving one another on, further and further on.\nSome balances last longer than others. Moments of realization that seem to sum up many moments,\nand then a solid groove of, \"yes, that is the way it is\" flows out, and the crowd begins to move.\nEach time it is Jerry who leads them out, his guitar singing and dancing joy. And his joy finds new levels,\nand the work of exploration begins again. \nJerry often talks of music coming from a place, and creating a place, a place where strife is gone,\nwhere the struggle to understand ends, and knowledge is as evident as light. That is the place\nthey are in at Springers. However hard it is to get there, once there, you want to cry tears of ease,\nand never leave. It is not a new place. Those who seek it hard enough, can find it.\nLike the poet Lucretius, who found it about 2500 years ago;\n\"All terrors of the mind, vanish, are gone, the barriers of the world, dissolve before me, and I see things happen,\nall through the void of empty space. I feel more than mortal pleasure in all of this.\"\nThe music goes fast and slow, driving and serene, loud and soft. Mickey switches from going to drums, \nto claves, to handclapping, to xylophone, to a tin slide whistle. The Bob grabs that away and steps to a mic,\nand blows the whistle as hard as he can flicking away insanely high and screeching notes. The band digs it,\nand lays down a building rhythm. The crowd begins to pant, shake and then suddenly, right on the exact moment\nwith the band, the crowd, the band, everything in the whole goddamn place begins to scream.\nNot scream like at the Beatles, but scream like beasts, twisting their faces, trying out every possible\nanimal yowl that lies deep in their hearts. \nJerry, melodies flowing from him like endless arabesques, leads it away again, the crowd, and himself,\necstatic rats to some unseen pied piper. The tune changes from Dark Star, to St. Stephen, the song\nwith a beat like bouncing boulders, and out of the din comes Jerry's wavering voice, \"One man gathers\nwhat another man spills,\" and everyone knows what that means, that there's nothing to fear, brothers will \nhelp one another with their loads, and suddenly there is peace in the hall. Phil, Bob and Bill form a trio,\nand play a new and quiet song, before Mickey's sudden roll opens it out to the group, and St. Stephen\ncrashes to an end with the cannon shot, and clouds of sulfurous smoke.\nOut of the fire and brimstone emerges the Pig, singing Lovelight, and everyone is through the mind\nand down into the body. Pigpen doesn't sing. Pigpen never sings. He is just Pig, being Pig, doing Lovelight.\nSpitting out the side of his mouth between phrases. Starting the clapping. Telling everybody to get their hands\nout of their pockets, and into somebody else's pockets, and like laughter, the band comes in with rock-it-to-em choruses.\nThe crowd is jumping up and down in witness by this time, and one couple falls on stage, their bodies,\nand tongues entwined in mad ritual embrace. They don't make love, but in acting it out, they perform\nfor and with the crowd, and so everyone is acting out sexual unison with Pigpen as the master of ceremonies.\nThe place, one body, built in music, fucks until it comes, the cannon goes off one final time, and Mickey\nleaps to the gong, bashing it with a mallet set afire by the cannon, and it makes a trail of flame, and then \nsparks when it hits the gong, the gong itself radiating waves of sonic energy. Bill flails at the drums,\nPhil keeps playing the same figure over and over, faster and faster, and Jerry and Bob build up to one note\njust below the tonic, hold it until, with one ultimate chord, it all comes home. The crowd erupts in cheers,\nas the band, sodden with sweat, stumbles off the stage.\n\"We'll be back folks\" says Jerry. \"We'll be back after a break.\" Bob laughs as he hears Jerrys announcement.\n\"It's really something when you have to lie to get off the stage.\" Because it's over, gone, wiped out. \nThey gather by the equipment van, and all but Tom, still cool and unruffled, are steaming in the chill night air. \nThe moon has gone down, the stars are out, and there is nothing more to be done that night at all.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is a show for the ages. Thank you.",

      "review_text": "bob weir is a golden god For my money (lol), this performance is every bit as fantastic as the wonderful Seminole Indian Village shows in Florida shows just a week prior.  Note for note it's arguably better than either of those.\n\nThis is nothing more or less than a quintessential Grateful Dead show from 1969, with all the bells and warts that you'd expect and a few that you'd never expect.  It's shows like this that almost (note: almost!) make me want to cast aside those Fillmore shows from February 69 as \"too serious.\"\n\nMorning Dew is great but it might be the least interesting/exceptional of all the songs here.\n\nMe and My Uncle smokes.  These early versions are all interesting but Jerry performs some of his best ever string-bending feats here.  Who needs a pedal steel when you can play like that?\n\nThe version of Doin That Rag is righteous.  It teeters into shredding as they approach the vocal coda which is exactly what it should do.  \n\nThe Dark Star is super groovy with a minimum amount of space or deep weirdness, almost more of a fall 68 feeling except that Bobby's chops are noticeably thicker and more assertive.  It sounds as it was Bobby who made the awesome call for Cosmic Charlie out of the Star.\n\nThe St. Stephen is notable for a tempo that seems relatively laid back for this time period and a beautiful intro jam lasting 5:01 (!) which I'm assuming is the longest ever instrumental intro to this song (pretty sure Jerry broke another string so nearly all of that five minutes is just Bobby and Phil and the rhythm section romping through the universe).\n\nThe Eleven rocks.  All killer, no filler.  Seems to me there is a splice right at the transition into Lovelight although I don't think much is missing from either song.\n\nThe Lovelight is ... cut.  That's unfortunate because what's here is pretty great (in addition to Weir's white noise vocal contributions, check out the peak around 16:30-16:50 for a taste of where the band's heads were at).  On the other hand, your ears can deduce from what remains that a major part of this performance is lost forever to time ... unless someone comes up with some film footage (dont' hold your breath).  Pig was known to dance around a bit and there are moments when you can hear the crowd reacting to something they are seeing, rather than hearing.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent overall but I wonder if a revisitation by Charlie (or whoever) and the application of \"new technology\" wouldn't improve things even further.  It's been 7 years at least and this is the only copy of this phenomenal show in the Archive as of April 22 2015.",

I think recordings like this one are what make 1969 some listeners' very favorite year. 5/30/69 is the perfect hybrid of the nimble, crackling psychedelia that would immortalize mid '67 to early '69 and that fat sonic density that would become so prominent from late '69 to early '71. From the first seconds of Morning Dew, you know you're in for a good one. Vocally and instrumentally the band is locked into this extremely energetic group mindset and they stay on that wavelength throughout. This Oregon Dead classic clocks in at roughly an hour and a half of rich Aoxomoxoa-era brilliance!",

      "review_text": "FAR FROM BEST 1969 I was ten in 1969 when I bought the Rolling Stone that had the article that covered this concert - but I've never heard it until just now. There are some really good moments, and the \"Dark Star\" is decent (but far below other stellar 1969 versions).  \"Cosmic Charlie\" is horrible - the singing is terrible!!!  \"St. Stephen\" is interesting with that long intro - but there are tuning problems with the instruments.  \"THE ELEVEN\" IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!  I turned \"Lovelight\" off before it ended (or got cut), but its first five minutes seem quite good as well.  This performance reminds me of when the sound and road crew used to razz these guys and say, \"Try not to sing.  At least not all at the same time.\"  \n\nI listened to two St. Louis shows the other day - 2/6/1969 (opening for Iron Butterfly) and 4/17/1969 (free concert at Washington University) - and both shows are phenomenal from start to finish - as are a couple dozen other 1969 concerts that I have heard.  \n\nI also bought AOXOMOXOA that summer of 1969 - and thought at the time that record was the very best from any band I'd ever heard (\"St. Stephen\" and \"Mountains of the Moon\" - lesser degree \"China Cat\") ... and the worst I'd ever heard on some other songs.  I'd already adored their first two records, but the bad songs made me think twice ... Thank God for LIVE DEAD - that sealed the deal for me.  This performance doesn't save the weaker songs from AOXOMOXOA - but other 1969 concerts definitely do.  This show probably seemed much better if you were there.  ",
