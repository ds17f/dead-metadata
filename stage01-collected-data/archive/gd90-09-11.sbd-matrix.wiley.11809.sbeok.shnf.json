The sound quality of this Healy Mix is probably better than what the Spectrum had to offer, but the China Cat >> Rider are not soundboard and are clearly from the audience..too bad.

      "review_text": "Welcome, Vince Being invited to play keyboards for The Grateful Dead must be similar to being asked to play drums for Spinal Tap.  (Bobby's comment about \"... not just any accordion player ...\" notwithstanding.)\nThis was Vince's fourth show out on the road, and he was hanging on very nicely.\nThere was an electricity in the parking lot that afternoon ... everybody had a feeling that this was going to be a Spectrum show to remember.\nDouble opener was a good hint.  Load for bear.  Mechanically competent first set, a good warm up.  The Bucket into intermission was another big clue.\nThe middle night of three seemed a safe place to try and put a perspective on things.  At some point, we all knew \"He's Gone\" would have to happen.  This was like being at church.  I'm sure it's my own attitude talking, but The Spectrum seemed a most appropriate place.  We all know the words.  Vince picked up on this ... he found a powerful place, some deep blues ... and as they jammed towards drums and space, some very primal energry swarmed about the stage and swirled around the arena.  Candace was on her game ... some of the best light work I recall.\nIt was a sort of \"transformation\" ... out of that jam session, a new sort of sound emerged, almost like a giant moth from a cocoon ... Vince Welnick had certainly made himself heard, and defined a place on stage with the rest of the band.\n(See 7/04/89 lest you think I'm not a Brent-head.)\nBottom line ... this is a very important moment in the transition of The Grateful Dead from the 1980's into the 1990's.",

Vince man. Not good. These were that last shows that I went too. After seeing what the Dead had become I just couldnt go anymore. The parking lot was a disaster. All the KIDS there to get as wasted as they could. It just turned ugly. Very Very sad. They shows from this point on were not 4 or 5 star shows at all. Be real people. Ive seen well over 150 shows since early 87. After Brent died, the whole dynamic changed. Went to see JGB to get my fix. They were Hot Shows. I have tried to listen to many shows after 90 and I cant get through any of them. But I have great memories of touring from 87 to 89. What a run of outstanding show. Miss them more than words can say.",

First saw the Dead in 1968, and thru all the various incarnations, Further Festivl, The Other Ones, and The Dead.\nThru many changes, the lose of Pigpen, the addition and loss of the Donna and Keith, the addition and loss of Brent, and the loss of Jerry. Through out the years the band played on, maybe not with the intensity as before. But the came back to surpass what was. The lost of Jerry was thought to be the death kneel for the group. But they came back as the \"Dead\". I can not speak for others, but, as for myself I was very sorry to see not touring dates for 2005. I hope this will be corrected in 2006, and a tour with the \"Dead\" will be on tour aqain. After all, throughtout their history they group was a group, and not about one person. The music was, and is enjoyed by countless people. And I hope to continue this tradition with my first grandchild. Both of my children are Greatful Dead fans, and over the years we have been to concerts as a family. Hoping to continue this with my granddaughter",

Bruce and Vince were at this show and it was one of the best of that era.... This recording is spot on great and enjoyable.  The Looks Like Rain>He's Gone>Spoonful is awesome.... and really eerie.  I think that the band really channeled the energy of Brent and the new band for this one.",

      "review_text": "I agree with the dis on the disful reviews RE: Vince I've been reading reviews and getting on internet discussions on various message boards for the past 15 plus years. One of the most tiresome, ego-centrict, and now it's become so cliche that even younger new fans just glom on to the attitude without doing any research or much more than scant listening enough to develop their own, real opinion.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is this nonsense that's passed around that everything passed Brandt was trash, and that vents sucked, and that the band sucks and that Jerry and nobody was listening to each other during those hundreds and hundreds of shows they played since the fall of 1990.\n\nEveryone knows their consistency very during those years which wasn't the case for most of their career.  Everyone should know that they played tons of top-notch shows during this time and when they knocked it out, they knocked it out, doing things musically, vocally, and playing songs that the earlier prehistoric versions of this band couldn't do.  \n\nIf the Grateful Dead taught you anything, it was to listen with open mind, to take a chance, to take the good, with the bad. What's this attitude fans have that's so egocentric, that's all me-me-me I want the band to fit the template I expect them to, I want them play what I want.  Either they don't get it, or they let wife I mean life beat them in there and p**** with them bad so they couldn't go to shows or they had to turn their back on the music so now they get on the internet and complain about Vince. I don't know.  The man killed himself probably cuz of bulshit Vibes like that, but that's another story.\n\nI've mentioned this in other places, but a friend of mine and I are working on a project where we are listening to every year of the vents era, starting with 95 and working backwards. We are raiding the shows on a five-star system, and comparing those shows to the same ones of that year. So each year has some five star shows in it, some more than others. Light 93 has a lot of 5 Stars shows, whereas 92, not so much. But we have learned a lot and found a lot of excellent and then some not so excellent performances. We are documenting all of them. Also some very interesting moments that seem to be forgotten. Like an amazing jam out of of Terrapin that's unlike anything I'd ever heard before let alone in 1993, also, a crazy Matilda Jam that's unreal and one of my favorite jams of all time and it happens in 1995!  Also, there's a time in 93 when Jerry actually plays Saint Stephen for several minutes during \"Sp>the last time\" and nobody seems to know about it or talk about it. Anyways, hopefully you'll buy our book! We have to finish the research. I'm typing out these comments because I'm just about to listen to the show so I can review it. Looks like it could be a five-star show but I'm going to give it 4 right now just to be realistic. Its going to take a lot to five star show in the fall of 90.in i.> \n ",

      "review_text": "First Hand Account I drove my rickety Datsun 310 that I could only start by shorting out the starter solenoid with a screwdriver (and it liked to stall) down from upstate New York to visit some of my best friends and catch this run.\n\nI'd caught the Spectrum shows for a few years at this point, and yes, the place was sort of a dump and a dinosaur, yet the Dead seemed to shine in this venue for whatever reason, cranking out some really hot and memorable shows. And by the 2nd set, the sound was always dialed in nicely. Right in sync with my medicine.\n\nThe first night something was off, to be sure. Of course, everyone there had Brent on their minds and the thought was, the band is disjointed, or just still in a state of shock. This was what, like the 4th, 5th and 6th shows after his loss, or right there abouts?\n\nOr it could just be an off night like they have - Jerry has indigestion or Phil has a headache, whatever it might be. Which was a shame because I'm a huge Scarlet->Fire fan and I've witnessed a smoking' hot version in that very building in the past. Whatever the reason, the band just didn't connect, and you can feel it when that happens. It was a decent first night, but nothing special.\n\nStaying at my friend's place was sweet because we could hop on the train and be there in about twenty minutes. Back in the good old days, we'd take over the park across the street and within minutes, Headville would spring to life. Tent on the grass, with the midway running down the paved park walkway where you could procure any manner of goods and services.\n\nAt these shows, however, the cops kept us out of the park, so festivities were confined to the hardscrabble parking lot. Plus, by this time we were used to seeing a huge contingent of the young kids, the fresh-faced youth who had heard Touch of Gray on the radio and discovered the party underneath. Just not the same vibe. I've always said that having a top 40 hit was the worst thing to happen to the Dead, and I hate that fucking song.\n\nBut it didn't matter. We slipped in via the Underground and went straight through the doors. I read another review where someone said on the second night there was electricity in the air, and he knew which tunes were coming out or some such nonsense. If there was something different about the second night, it was a feeling of comfort. The Heads had found their friends and gotten a nights rest, we were once again used to the Spectrum and knew where we wanted to be. I think this was the same for the band. I think that they had to stick to some pretty standard sets as Vince was still learning the music, and by now, their 5th or 6th show together, they seemed to loosen up. Whatever the reason, everyone seemed pretty relaxed.\n\nI'm a sucker for a Jack Straw opener. It really kicks the night into gear. The whole first set was on point and finished with a sweaty Hell in a Bucket that really got the crowd warmed up, and lent a bit of expectation for trips to come. The band clicked but didn't over do it. Who is it, Megafaun I think? Those lyrics, \"If it starts too fast, it's gonna end real slow\". You know they've seen some shows. I know that everyone has their own preferences. Some people like a real spacey show, some like a slow, relaxed pace. I'm the third type. I like a red-hot freight train rolling down hill with no brakes.\n\nSo when the 2nd set opened with a loose and sloppy China Cat, everyone was feeling it, and the magnetic connection between Dead and Heads was well and truly established. Sure, Jerry's voice was croakin' and crackin', but man did he have an iron grip on that guitar. I'm not an old timer. I never saw a 70's show, and some OG's don't like this later stuff, but I'm like, \"Dude, are you listening to this?\" By halfway through China Cat, the band and the crowd were in perfect synchronization. Which was amazing, because everyone in the room was in complete shock about this thing that had just happened. Even in the first set, Brent was on my mind. Now, during Rider, the lyrics of \"gonna miss me when I'm gone...\" were really hitting home. Then, after a fairly average LLR, Jerry hits us right in the chest with a killer He's Gone, and we were in mourning. It was like, everyone knew what everyone else was thinking about, and the band said, we're going to acknowledge this shit and we're going to face it head on. And we're going to do it together. In reality, they did it for us. Maybe it was cathartic for them also, but what seemed certain was they were letting us know that it was okay to grieve, but it was going to be okay.\n\nAnd then, just to accentuate the point, the band slides from He's Gone into a slick jam that melts effortlessly into Spoonful. From Jerry's moaning cries of loss into the pure evils of sister heroin. This is what it's about. This is that terrible thing that, once it gets a hold of you, it doesn't let go, and there's always a toll to pay. At this show we were mourning Brent, and the band took us to church. A mere five years later it would be Jerry's turn, and we still mourn their loss today as their voices and jams haunt these tapes.\n\nAnd as all of these twisted thoughts spiraled around my brain, I was dancing next to my best friend like I had no bones. Or more accurately, it was like I had new joints in between my regular joints and they all were articulated in both directions. I was well and truly posessed. Spoonful came to an end, but Jerry kept going. The rest of the band kind of backed off waiting to get a feel for where Jerry was going, and at one point they just let him play, supported by just a shimmer of sound. And Jerry set sail on his own. Phil, predictably, was the first to really jump in with him. And once Jerry settled on some more standard chords everyone got into sync. Jerry teases some Eyes at one point and then he's off again into uncharted territory. He even comes back to some hyper Spoonful licks until suddenly everyone is in a pure, improvised, flat out jam - pure ecstasy - that gives way to Mickey and Bill. Damn, Mickey was at his evil best. I've had Drums turn on me, but this was twisted bliss.\n\nWheel, for me, is always a treat, followed by as good a Miracle as any you'll hear from the late 80's, early 90's. Just a metric ton of energy. Then it was right back to church with Black Peter that truly highlights Jerry's singing talent. He sounds like an old, decrepit man on his deathbed, and our hearts cried for Brent. Jerry closes the song with an angry, cutting solo that laid his soul bare right there in front of us all, with no shame, and I melted inside. I realized that I could not imagine what he was going through, we could only radiate our love back at the stage. It sounds poetic, but I promise you that's exactly how it felt.\n\nThey clocked out with Around and Around, I think mainly just to get back to something light. But damn if Vince's chords didn't sound just like Brent was sitting at the keys, and he put up a nice solo to boot that had everyone cheering him on. And then of course, for the encore they came back with Knockin' and Heads' heads turned skyward. The girl behind me stood stock still, hands clasped in front of her and paid tribute to Brent. Something I will never forget.\n\nI didn't start going to shows until the mid 80's. Even so, I've seen some rip-roaring shows that had me dancing my socks off. But the combination of everyone's mood, the tremendous weight of Brent's loss, combined with the material they selected, and the at times passionate, angry, ecstatic and tender flow of emotion between the band and us, each of us just trying to muddle our way through, this show, 9/11/90, long before 9/11 took on an entirely different meaning, this is the absolutely best and most rewarding concert experience I've ever had. Better than any other Dead show and of course, miles above any other of the hundreds of bands I've seen. The band was on fire, completely in sync with each other and with their fans. And at this point, Vince was fantastic. His playing was solid and he fit right in. And there was some heavy shit to deal with, and the band faced it head on and we all went through it together. The way a close family should.\n\nSo if you're wondering if you should get one of these shows, the answer is fuck yes. The second night is where it all happened, where we all mourned the loss of Brent but were assured that we would get through it and eventually we'd be okay. Jerry was on fire, pouring his heart out on the stage, mind-melding with the band as if they were a single organism. And we danced.\n\nI was there again for the following night as well, but honestly at that point it was almost as if there was nothing left to say. We danced some more because what else could we do? He's gone, and nothing's going to bring him back...\n\n",
