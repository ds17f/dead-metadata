Outstanding \"Franklin's Tower\" and the \"Sugaree\", \"Scarlet Begonias\"/Goin' Down the Road\" are cool but the \"Not Fade\" jam before \"Drums\" is unique.........the recording isn't all that great compared to whats available on this tour but the show should not be forgotten.

Franklin goes on a bit too long without new ideas. Sugaree is also a weak spot.\n\nHightlights for me are Deal and Wharf Rat, which have power and passion, conveyed in soulful singing and guitar, and band members in-tune with each other. These two are worth a listen.\n\nThe band gets hot on Music Never Stopped, where Jerry's on fire. This is followed by a fast-paced Samson with a high-energy Jerry solo near the end. The Estimated Prophet is tight, the musicianship and vocals are on target, and has some nice Jerry's soloing.\n\nThe Scarlet suffers from the \"lazy drumming\" (we used call it \"disco drumming\") that we sometimes get in '77. This this the simple beats 1 and 3 rhythm that sounds like a drum machine. (Compare to the more free-form drumming in previous years.) The transition to Goin' Down the Road is a highligh of the show, however, and worth a listen. It's one of the best transitions of '77. Unfortuantely, \"drum machine\" returns once GDTRFB starts. \n\n\"Drums\" starts with the whole band in some great jamming to Not Fade Away without words. A little while later, we get that great Wharf Rat.",

I began listening aware of this being an audience recording; the longer I listen, the more I \"don't notice.\" In other words, I hear almost no flaws, and there are no indications that the music, on April 29, 1977, sounded any different than is presented right here. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CROWD HEARD. LUCKY US! The recording is very smooth and great for low volume listening (I've been studying the entire time). I can hear everything just fine, and now that I crank it for just a second, all of the instruments are right there, just as at the low volume. This is the sign of a great recording. I'm happy to have listened, and this will definitely make my smooth and easy-going list. For me, highlights, or things that have stood out while I haven't been paying attention, are Sugaree, Wharf Rat, Feelin' Bad, Franklins, The Wheel, and Brown Eyed Women. I've been on a Brown Eyed kick lately though, so I may be biased. \nHappy Listening \nBy the way, first time I've ever heard an Around and Around with a breakdown like this at the end.\nGreat Show",

Jerry stumbles during his first solo in Help and doesn't look back. A psychedelic hurricane to say he least. The rest of the show is just plain average in my opinion. Sound is VG+, the 5 stars applies to Help->Slip->Franklin's only.",

      "review_text": "Hello NYC!! 4/29/1977 \nThe Palladium \n\nThis week we find ourselves at opening night of a 5 night run in NYC at The famed Palladium. This also happens to be the sixth show of arguably the finest Grateful Dead tour ever. I would not have said that 3 or so years ago, but that was because I had not yet given shows from this tour so many close, complete listens. Most vary from very good to downright great, and this one would fall under the latter category. I had listened to the 30th many times before, but never the 29th. This show has a personality all its own and really never lets up. Yet again, I had no idea what I was in for going into this one. \n\nThis show starts off with a BANG, in the form of H>S>F. Right away, not unlike 5/9, you can tell there is a little something extra in the air. They have some heavy snap and pop going on and Jerry is absolutely off his ass. Perfect harmonies from Donna tonight, while Billy and Mick sound absolutely spot on and perfectly in sync. Franklin\u2019s would most definitely be the highlight of these three as it clocks in on it\u2019s own at around 15 min or so, and it\u2019s just one of those moments in music where absolutely everything seems to come together. That\u2019s the best way I can put it. Absolutely remarkable opening trifecta right there. Minglewood comes next, and it\u2019s pretty well done considering they already set the barometer so goddam high already this evening. Anyhow, not bad Bobby, I enjoyed it. Next up the Aud spices in and you can hear the crowd really well for the first time, and they absolutely ROAR when Jerry does the first few licks of Tennessee. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a reception that warm, for that tune, ever. Nice  The tune is well done and Jerry even gives that mini-solo out a little extra. Bobby rolls Cassidy out next, and I like this one with the exception of the length of the tune. It starts out innocently enough, but Jerry then takes the solo really, really high for about 90 seconds and it reminded me of \u201cBeautiful Jam\u201d for just a second \u2013 and then he winds it right down and kills it. I\u2019m starting to see a pattern of this when it comes to Cassidy and Spring \u201977 tour. They never seem to take it too far, and always reel it in early\u2026.imo anyways\u2026.With the first few licks of TLEO you know Jerry is cutting the funk loose, and this version is a keeper. That super patient, super funky slow-ass playing just slays me, I f*n love it. Always been a fan of this tune and this one is well done. They follow that up with being straight up shot out of a canon in the form of Big River. This one just explodes from the start and never ever looks back. The trading and soloing Kieth and Jerry do is insane. I think it may suffer a little from being Aud only, but I absolutely love this one. Pure 100% GD Yeehaw love right here and Jerry is pickin\u2019 his ass off. This is the definition of barnburner, personified. I fucking love this Big River and I\u2019m not sure there is a better one out there. WOW. Loser rolls out next, just as languid and desperate as could be. Great storytelling from Jerry and the crowd eats it up. His vocals sound damn near perfect tonight by the way. To round out the first set we have an absolute shit-hot TMNS. Awesome rhythm, great vocals and all together fantastic. The crowd also goes NUTS for Donna\u2019s little solo \u2013 which I find more than a little ironic. Jerry and Keith take over at around the 5 minute mark and just ride this to the moon \u2013 absolutely smokin\u2019 it. Jeezus man \u2013 BOOM! That is how you close out a motherf*n first set ladies and gentlemen. Amazing shit right there. The crowd was completely blown out of the water by this one. Amongst the very best TMNS, if not the very best I\u2019ve heard. \n\nThoughts on the first set \u2013 Killer. Straight up dank. The barometer was set sky high with the H>S>F opener and they did not back off a bit. That Big River and TMNS were a very close second to that ridiculous opener. This one has surely hath started off with a bang. \n\nThe second set opens with a well played Samson, however like I\u2019ve said before \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to be unbiased about this tune. I just don\u2019t really like it. I do like a strong opening dance tunes and this one is that. Next up is the not-your-everyday combo of Sugaree>El Paso. I would tell you on paper there is no way in hell I thought this would work as well as it did. Sugaree was tempered nicely, and the tempo only increased ever so gradually throughout the 14 minute version \u2013 and Jerry just crushes it. This one is all him and a thing of beauty. Now, the interesting part \u2013 the transition to El Paso. He walks this one down really slowly to the end and then everyone kinda sustains their finish \u2013 until Jerry starts with the cowboy noodlin\u2019 once again. That worked shockingly well, and I\u2019m a fan of it. A clean cut, classic BEW rolls out next and Jerry\u2019s vocals really shine here again. I love the lyrics and he accentuates them so well, he\u2019s just got this one down to a science. Nice \u2013 really nice. Next up is Estimated, and for some reason I got the feeling Jerry wasn\u2019t really into it. Clocking in @ only 9 minutes, obviously not a whole lot of exploration was going on. His solos seemed a little drifty/dreamy, but not really going anywhere. It\u2019s not like it was terrible, but there are so many killer version surrounding this one that it seems sub par comparatively (Spring \u201977) speaking. Next up, batting cleanup is the combo of Scarlet>GDTRFB>NFA Tease>Drums>Wheel>Rat>R&R. This Scarlet starts off pretty basic and has some relatively high points, and Donna\u2019s harmonies are really nice. Keith does do this harpsichord kinda thing at around the 6 min mark that I really couldn\u2019t put my finger on \u2013 prolly some kinda weirdness outta the Rhodes. At around the 8 minute mark you can hear Billy and Mick starting that heavy thump of GDTR and it sounds fantastic. Somehow, without me hardly noticing they were knee deep into GDTRFB and I missed the transition. I went back and gave it another spin, and then I realized why \u2013 it was so seamless. Another not-your-everyday combo that worked Hella good!! They work this fat groove right into the pocket without looking back. Man, what a transition that was \u2013 like it didn\u2019t exist cause it was so damn smooth. After about 5 min they jump off into a little NFA jam that I really dug. I wish they would kept up that drippy funk, but alas, Drums creeps in and takes over. I absolutely love Wheel when its done well and this one out of Drums is just that. There aint nothin\u2019 like a well done Wheel from Spring \u201977 \u2013 Shit, the Wheel from 5/25 is my alarm clock every morning. They just nail this one, and I\u2019m quite sure the crowd was as captivated as I was. From there Jerry kinda slinks this one into a very well done Rat which the crowd freakin hoots and hollers for \u2013 I mean goin\u2019 nuts. From there we get the Chuck Berry close in R & R, which I figured was coming after the TMNS closer for the first set. I\u2019ve said many times before that these Spring \u201977 shows could be so much more with a different closer \u2013 Like Dew. The encore is a well done UJB and again this is one of those tunes that I think sounds better with Donna. They close the door on UJB and that is that. WOW. Fucking wow. \n\nSo where does this leave me? Blown away, that\u2019s where. This is an absolute top tier show which actually reminded me of Springfield \u2013 with an inverted set list(sorta). I was never bored nor did I ever even have the inkling to bump any tune. I don\u2019t think this one hits the highs of say, 5/8, 5/9, 5/17 or 5/25, but that takes nothing away from this magnificent performance. A hell of a way to say hello to NYC in Spring \u201977 boys, and I give this show a solid A. It was damn near perfect in every way \u2013 more polished than some and less exploratory than others. There is a shitload of meat on this bone, and it takes a few listens to take it all in. Fantastic show by any standard. I really dug reviewing it.",

      "review_text": "77 in retrospect This is a great show! shame theres no soundboard, but its not a bad audience recording... funny how this is what I used to get (~10 generations in!) and it was still great! \nSo, if we listen to this with that in mind... in a good venue (don't think I ever got into Academy, whatever it was called, over the years, and in my time) this is a damn good recording, with not too much crowd, decent range, and an early start to the excitement and enthusiasm of Spring 1977... it really does start at the Winterland in March! \nI will never stop appreciating that the Dead would go find \"smaller\" venues, even during my time! Recently finding joy in hearing the crowd sing along with Jerry, or vice versa, during Franklin's Tower! Ultimately, grateful that we have any recording!",

      "review_text": "Comes after W factor <br />This was the first show here since March '72. Unfortunately the SBD (mostly) remains in the vault. Fortunately we have a Jerry Moore AUD that's so dynamic we can even hear Phil. It's the start of 5 hot shows in the venue, but the 4th of 8 in a row in the NYC metro area. Note that Keith is using a synth; a rarity for him though he often brought one on tour. The Sugaree and the GDtRFB are well-noted but there is so much more. While the next night is probably the run's best, this has all the cachet of a spring '77.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Help on the Way</i> warms up and Jer becomes very dynamic going into <i>Slipknot!</i>. The latter has very interesting passages, and listen for Keith alternating keyboards. <i>Franklin's</i> has just enough gobsmacking passages to recommend (given there are so many good ones on this tour). <i>Minglewood</i> is charging, loping, awesome, and <i>Tennessee Jed</i> is   as solid as it gets. That still doesn't prepare you for the horizon-expanding <i>Cassidy</i>. So good. The rest is average (for this tour). <i>They Love Each Other</i> is an   upstanding citizen (volunteering at local charities), but on <i>Big River</i> Bobby's guitar is dropped from the mix. <i>Loser</i> is a little flat but Bobby returns to the mix halfway, in time for a solid <i>Music Never Stopped</i>\n\nSecond Set. Jer has to fight for the solo in <i>Samson</i>, but it has the first set NRG plus deep dives from Phil. This <i>Sugaree</i> is a mastodon. There's a lot here, but  check out after 8mins how they are about to go into the jubilee lyric, with Keith playing accordion-synth tones, when the mood strikes them to expand a little, then more, and then it just overflows. The AUD is not as clear for <i>El Paso</i>. And <i>Brown Eyed Women</i> has a skip @2:01 (that can be filled), but it's a great version,  uptempo, with fine Bobby fills and good Donna. <i>Estimated</i> suffers only in comparison to others on the tour (it's in between 4/25 & 5/7!). <i>Scarlet</i> starts rough but becomes solid, with an interesting seg into a shiny <i>Goin' Down the Road</i>. On the latter, listen how after 7mins, at the drop into the Goodnight Jam, Jer starts Not Fade Away instead but when it obstinately doesn't snap, veers them into a jam that sticks generally to GDtRFB, but with minor pentatonics and a beat from NFA. So cool! The rest is average for '77. <i>Wharf</i> is GOGD, <i>Around & Around</i> is  taken at slower tempo than the rest and, if not one of the year's best versions, it's still an exciting AUD (there's a brief cut @6:10 and another @8:05). <i>Uncle John's</i> is a straight read, clean.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 4\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nSlipknot! through Cassidy - are peak Dead\nSugaree - a mastodon\nBrown Eyed Women - tight, uptempo, Bobby fills, good Donna\nGoin' Down the Road Feeling Bad - also check the jam coming in\n\nSOURCES: The moore_unknown_7113 runs a little fast, <u>needing -1%</u> pitch correction. It also benefits from   BAL and EQ intervention. Sugaree and Scarlet>Goin' Down the Road are on <b>Download 1</b> in high quality.",
