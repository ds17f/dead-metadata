The setlist is very interesting and a lot of the performances are really above average.\nBut this show has something amazing to offer: an incredible version of Scarlet Fire.\nThe version of this combo is spectacular for the transition into Fire. What happened is still a mystery to me but Jerry is taking off.\nIf any of you believe i do exagerate please be my guest and check this transition.\njerry is like a volcano in full eruption that doesn't want to cool down.\nIt is a miracle that the others managed to stick with him at this stage as he is really far out.\n\nBut the way the band manages to land the transition into Fire is a masterpiece:\nA comet landing on earth in a wild explosion...\n\nFor the fans: check the compendium Vol 2 on this one, you will know what i am talking about.\n\nSo put on the Dead and spread!",

Little Red Rooster with Bobby's slide, then Brent solo, then Bobby and Jerry tearing it all down- whew!! Deal is just a flaming meteor of energy! Of course, set II is where things get really serious... Enough said about the Scarlet-Fire. Surely will move the most stoic amongst us. The most wonderful thing on top of the stellar jamming is that Jerry nails the lyrics to just about every song! May seem trivial, but I found myself cheering and jumping around with glee and joy! Get this show and prepare for lift off. And yes, the intro into the Wheel from outer Space will leave your eyes moist. We miss you Jerry.",

The second set is a real journey, truly remarkable. What those people saw and heard on 11/30/80 in Atlanta is something to behold.   \n\nIt is not without its controversy. There seems to be dissention among the Heads concerning Scarlet/Fire and I can see that. Some have called it the best they have ever heard, others have called it overrated. If I was to pick one weak spot in the concert it would be the Scarlet/Fire. To me it was average, which means compared to other music out there it is outstanding. I recorded the concert, let it lie for months, then listened to it. I then decided that I was going to redo my two CD\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s and actually drop Scarlet/Fire. Then I listened to it again weeks later and could not figure out why I would want to eliminate them. So even I am conflicted. But the rest of the concert is not confusing. It is outright in the top 10 of the 115 I have recorded, and once I review them all I would not be surprised if it lands in my top 5. \n\nLet\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s talk about Playin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 shall we?

Very powerful Deal to close the first set, one of the fastest and most danceable Scarlet's I have ever heard, but then something happens here.  The recording, which had to this point been mostly SBD, goes AUD for the rest of the show.  Normally, I would of been annoyed by this, but in this case actually found myself facinated in the contrasts between the SBD and AUD recordings, both of them excellent in quality.  I haven't found too many shows here where you get that type of contrast.  Even the venerable Barton Hall show has some pretty poor AUD patches in them.  The AUD recording really plays well for Samson and Drums, and the Ship of Fools is already a favorite version of mine.  All around a great show, highly recommended.\n\nhttp://bornagaindeadhead.blogspot.com/",

There are a couple of teaser builds before the transition to Fire finally happens.  And, when it does happen, it is seamless, funky, and perfectly synchronized.  \n\nThen, the Fire on the Mountain is fun, funky, and very well jammed.  A nice, crisp and succinct ending to the Fire wraps it all up brilliantly.\n\nI agree with others that the whole show is noteworthy ... if not, one of the best ever.\n\nI would also add that the Samson & Delilah, which hasn't been noted much on these reviews, was incredible ... really biblical.  You can hear the power of Samson (and maybe also the power of God?!) coming through the whole band on this one.  They were tight, strong, and powerful on this Samson.  Really rockin'.  Be careful when you listen to it, though, you might just 'tear this whole building down.'",

The atmosphere and playing are exceptional. I originally gave this recording a lower rating due to the half aud half soundboard mix. I wish it was one or the other, preferably the AUD. But the show itself is very solid. Brent by now is fully integrated into the Dead's sound and plays his ass off. Jerry is exceptional on Playin' and the band sound inspired throughout. Solid from start to finish, a very good show that sounds like a party.",

Just came back from the Radio City shows, and ready to continue my trek of dozens of shows to follow with GREAT friends and by myself. I can, and will speak to the shows I've seen. But my GD experience has also been molded by certain tapes.\nSome before I went to shows,\nand others during the run.\nTHIS!!! is one that was, and continues to be, a staple in my listening world.\nFirst of all, Good Auds over SBD'S anytime! That's how I had this.\nI've been to , and listened to anything I could, (in LARGE part due to this site). Crazy wild late 60's,to explorative 73-74, to crancking 77's,and on to the sad end )  \nI love it all for what it is. And the different songs, moods, places, and eras only lend to the experience and relationship that we've all developed with the band. Sorry... THE best Scarlet/Fire,and space/Wheel..PLEASE find me something better. I've tried, but can't.The whole 2nd set-Bobby's Mick imitation( Around..),UJB encore, etc. The playing the transitions;this was one of those nights I wished I could see (I think I feel it from the aud)the band moving and playing as one. A DVD, something. \nThey're a VERY rare group. Enoy this. There's tons more. Better set lists,breakouts, memorable shows attended, but for REAL special nights, this is right up there.\nENJOY!!!",

Loved it from start to finish.  Just had to mention that this Ramble on Rose is one of my favorites of all time, along with the version from the closing of Winterland.  I highly recommend this show to anyone who is into 80-82.  One of the best of the era.  I also recommend TORRENTS.  On many torrent sites they have torrents grouped by the year.. all soundboards.  usually around 50 soundboard shows per year.  If you have the space on your computer, download the program UTorrent and then start downloading these \"grateful dead soundboard shows ____(year)\"  You will not be dissapointed.

The shows were archived so one could listen to old shows for up to about 3 or 4 years. One night he played this show starting w/Big River thro' Scarlet/Fire. This became easily my favorite online archived Professor shows to listen to while playing poker. W/out actually doing a heads up comparison, that is playing the same song from two different shows back to back, I came to ponder this:am I listening to the best versions of these songs I've ever heard? Can it be? All in one show? For the five or seven songs, depending on who's counting, these rate among the very best ever. Today I'm getting hooked up w/the complete show from a 'friend' over @ EBeans & I'm looking a 3 hour window to head out on the old country road & enjoy this, senses completely intact.",

This version of Scarlet > Fire (I've never heard \"scar fire\" as the article mentions) is indeed exuberant.    The solo in scarlet is a great way to judge Garcia on a particular night.   Sometimes he'll do 12 verses trying to get to something and never quite does (e.g. Portland 6/12/80) or sometimes he absolutely nails it and takes it up and down the neck before finally going back to \"Wind in the Willows plays tea for two\".  On the nights when he neither hits nor gives it those extra tries, you know he's tired (at least at that moment).  Althea is another song of this era that he gets into this level of search/expression on. 80/81 are underrated years - he was playing great.  The China Doll solo on this one is a ripper.",

Sirius was playing this when I was talking on the  cause phone with my boss and I suddenly realized I couldnt hear a freaking thing he was saying cause Jerry was killing it and I wanted to hear more so I got off the phone quickly. \nThe thing we have to remember with these shows is that I am sure on nights like this they are looking at Brent and smiling  because they realize that they have someone special in the band cause Brent just kills it all the way through here. The way he fills in with organs and electric piano is awesome. Jerry is playing with a fervor , like a madman esp during Fire, I mean like he is pissed off.

It is so painfully clear that anyone who takes the time to post that this Scarlet/Fire is lame is simply not able to rank highly anything that they didn't actually witness.

You may not think that it is #1 but it is right up there with the best and for you to type a pan of this version just exposes you. Trust me, real heads listen to this and read your post and just shake there head at you the way you would George Bush, Joseph McCarthy, O J Simpson, or Leona Helmsley.

While I'd say the band, as a unit, isn't as rhythmically in-the-pocket as other outings, what makes this show stand out to my ears is how you can hear JG reaching for something harmonically, wringing the nooks and crannies of these tunes from all sorts of surprising, sparkling angles, giving especially the 2nd set a unique and extremely psychedelic fingerprint. Of course, you can hear JG reaching this particular way in sundry other shows - but on 11/30 the kaleidoscope doesn't stop, and it's great to be able to hear this constellation of the band, on this particular night, gradually solving the problem of meshing with it, in time for a classic, blooming 2nd set. The Scarlet-Fire and Space-Wheel transitions are great examples. I'll also agree w/other reviewers that SOF and PITB are ++exceptional, not to be missed.",

The other reviews have hit on some of the stand outs, but I want to emphasize that the \"S >F\" is stellar.\n\nI've said some of this on headyversion, but I wanted to come back here and share my thirty cents. I've got a copy, but I'm seriously thinking of buying the official release for two reasons. First, there haven't been many 80s releases (when compared with 70s releases), and there won't be if they don't sell. I know everyone has their favorite sound/year/tour, etc., but there's definitely lots of stuff from the 80s worth checking out, and it'd be nice to hear those in high-quality official versions.\n\nSecond, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first official matrix that's been put out. I personally like the mix of SBD clarity and AUD ambience and hall sound, but I also love the idea of more official matrix releases. There are some shows with great AUDs and so-so SBDs (and vice versa), so I think matrices would open up the potential for official releases in a big way.\n\nAgain, just my own opinion, and I know everyone won't agree, but if either of these things\u2013\u2013more 80s releases and/or more matrix releases\u2013\u2013sound like something you're interested in, considering shelling out for a copy.",

What I hear is an immediate intensity and drive from Jerry, who constructs a precise and climactic melody through the transition to Fire. But Brent is behind him listening, backing off and then pushing forward. My personal opinion, this Scarlet>Fire is the ultimate example of the Dead working as a unit - Jerry poops out a bit on Fire, but getting there he and they were clockwork.",
