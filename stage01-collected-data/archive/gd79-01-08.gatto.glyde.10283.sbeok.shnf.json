I was fortunate enough to be at this show, only my second, but I never appreciated it until I got my hands on the tape. The energy level and music both stay at extrordinary levels from Half-Step through Good Lovin'.

Im partial to 73-74 and 90-91 boards so that should put it into perspective.  Im not sure a SBD would even save this one for me, though.

      "review_text": "Review of reviews, compliments to site/oper. ! This is a comment on this show's reviews, given there are quite a few of the show itelf already and even though, I didn't attend nor am I sure if I've even heard this one yet, but I certainly have heard others of this time period; so aside from much of the following, I do have a specific educated commment regarding a portion of this show in relationship to it's contemporaries, (see below).\n     In fact I arrived here looking at most of these shows for info related to folks/equipment, etc. of the period, and had actually forgotten that this is \"the most downloaded show currently\"; given that the most active period of taping I did myself, (West Coast) was during the surrounding time; most of which as it turned out, have well known boards, for example the last K&D show amongst others.\n     So I'd like to compliment the site operator(s)/webmaster(s) since there are several reviews posted, for keeping up a decenting opinion ! I can't yet say which way I'd gravitate toward in the debate ?\n   But for example I'll never forget during the break at Brent's first show (a few months later, if you don't already know that), I was making small talk conversation with the sorrounding folks, just being freindly and somehow I started to say something about a jazz show I'd attended the previous year, (McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter, Sonny Rollins and  Al Foster) al influences on Grateful Dead etc., in relationship somehow to improvisation or something or other etc., when at least with this one fellow, if not most of the other folks around me, I suddenly realized, that these were what I still consider some of the more narrow minded variety of music fans. (The look on his face etc., was like there is no other band but the Grateful Dead). So I suddenly said, something like \"Oh, excuse me. I forgot I'm at a Grateful Dead concert.\" At which point he offered out his hand, as if to allow me to re-join the collective so to speak.\n     So that is to say, part of what many of us related to with Grateful Dead is that it was more easy to see that there virtuosity was(is) on a par with some more tightly structured/heavily rehearsed bands or a philharmonic orchestras etc. yet, still seemed quite humanly fallable unlike others who if they made some mistakes etc., without extreme scrutiny, one would seldom notice any great difference, ie. just like most of the rest of us ! Having said all that ...\n     Now back to the show at hand. The fellow who wrote the decenting opinion acknowledged the excellence of the Lazy Lightin'-> Supplication. Having myself seen and recorded at the show, several before and after this one. I can attest to the \"late\" Lazy Lightin' period (end K&D-early Brent) as it's best.\n     Also, admittedly, I was the type who after they stopped playing it, would yell at the top of my lungs for it amongst others. And No Lie, I got my request fulfilled, on think more that one occasion, at least once instantly amongt one or two other songs that day at the Greek '82; which obviously blew not only my mind, but of course those around me whom I'd subjected to my outbursts at the quietest moments.\n     Some of these can be heard on various audience recordings that I didn't make, for example, me yelling \"Warp 10\", (someone I got my first copy of 1974-10-18 from had labeled the cassette this way), either before, The Eleven Jam 1979-12-26, or was that the next night before the \"Meantime A Day At the Dentist\", teeth drilling improvisation ? I haven't listened to that in a while, but I'm sure they're both this site. Or similarly, \"The final frontier\" before improvisation at other shows. But I made it a point, never to yell for St. Stephen or Dark Star ! (Although I did see St.Stehen once before this and Dark Star 5 1/2 times after this.)\n     So thanks for the tip Bro. I wait in great anticipation of at least that part of this show, as a mind blower !",

I just rubber necked and said whoa whats this? answer a decent show-nothing out of the ordinary, Jerry's voice is shot from either opiates or free base and as far as plus side it's a pretty decent show with a few gems included moohichrlisted below. I couldnt figure out what the big attraction was so I checked out the set list for something that stands out, the sound is an average aud. not bad not great, so then my next step was read the reviews there probably some hot transitions or whatever but nothing except \"nice Terrapin\" or \"Scarlet>Fire\" \n \n happy trails}}}}}}",

He passed away about ten years ago. His vast live concert library and musical knowledge were eclipsed only by his love for his family and patients. It brings great joy to know that he is remembered through music by his Greatful Dead friends. He traveled extensively recording every show he could attend from coast to coast.

He's just coming off a bout with bronchitis form the fall, this show was part of a make-up tour from late fall postponement. Probably one of the top 2 first sets you'll ever hear.

I'll forever be gratefully stuck with memories of Phil & Friends fall '08 with Molitz and Jackie Green as my very first show. Playin opener(heard it on the way in), halfstep, rain and snow starts 2 minutes before it starts raining, masons, playin reprise set closer where phil's vocal mic shut off and the whole band got off time...phil just hit that deep note and they stopped and ran off stage. The lights stayed in the \"on\" position, along with my personal pictures of Uncle Al in his observatory holding cheshire cat:) Deep feelings of love and happiness filled every part of me. The guy in front of us turned to me, my girl, and my friend Konky, and said \"NOW THE REAL SHOW'S ABOUT TO START\" The crowd went nuts...I turned around and realized my younger sister was standing right behind me...Then Phil and Friends came back onstage and encored Attics. COSMIC. Can't touch that moment. It happened again at the dead in greensboro last spring at the beginning of Truckin'...one of those upsurges in crowd energy where you can SEE the freakin energy coiling up above the crowd.  Been going to panic shows(ON FIRE) since I was 12, and didn't get into the Dead until 10 years later, about 4-5 years ago. At first, I couldn't even listen to haggard Jerry, hoarse as hell, barely standing. But then, as I got older, and saw the best panic i'd ever seen, I realized that once the heat of the music wears off, there's a community within that means just as much. I go to shows now to see friends and have a good time. I like to look at the band's new gear, and the pretty girls and space out in the stars (outdoor summer shows are my favorite). I would give a finger to have been at this msg show in 79. I plan to invent the flux capacitor for specific reasons just like this. For people who were so lucky to experience some shit like this and dis it is akin to making logic of silly putty, just plain silly. For me, an early January Dead show would be like riding a shooting star. I'm not saying this is the best Dead show I've ever heard, but c'mon, einstein said it, relativity. Zero is an abstract concept not present in nature. You can't negate something right there in front of you, just like you can't say that this 79 show doesn't rock your fucking socks off. It's so funny to read these boards with these grumps, with 40+ years of music at their fingertips. What I wouldn't give to have walked in your shoes, and then sold them at a Grateful Dead show. By the way this space post Hell in a Bucket is sick. I give it 5 stars for great sounding aud...high enthusiasm, heavy sounding notes, and full frequency fun! the smokestack says heat right? Pig would be Proud A WOOHOO",

      "review_text": "I love you, Charlie Miller, but this show ain't it The sound quality is = butt. The performance quality is clearly average. Why are you giving this four stars, let alone five? There are plenty of way better shows from this winter...12-12-78's HS>Frank's is out of this world, plus you can actually hear the notes. 12-19-78's scarlet fire soars and burns, among other songs, plus you can actually hear the notes. 12-31-78 has an equally great terrapin & playin', and yet you can actually hear it. 2-03-79 has a vicious, scorching s>f and a ferocious Other One, plus you can actually hear the notes. 2-17-79 is a long show with good sound and a wide variety of good performances.\n\nIn contrast to the above standouts from a great period, this show is just average. The only thing unusually well-played here is the Candyman, and maybe Donna's performance in Scarlet.\n\nTo all the people who say, \"ohh, but its all about the *Enthusiam* of the crowd\" I say, Yeah, enthusiasm is great--that's why, for example, people praise the matrices of 5-8-77, and the 12-31-78 album, because the crowd cheers at the openings of the songs and at the end of each big jam. It can add to the music. But on here, the crowd is so much louder than the music that it doesn't add to the music, it actually erases parts of the music. That's not a good thing.\n\nOh and to Mr. HiTiMeNiCeToMeEtYoU below, keep in mind you are not reviewing the \"community\". You are reviewing a specific performance and a specific recording job. Also, hell in a bucket was not played this night...In conclusion, don't write a show review while stoned.

To me it seems as though they follow this formula: \"I like this, and therefore it's good.\" That's fine and dandy, especially when they detail why. (The same is so, \"I don't like this, and therefore it's not good.\")\n\nGarcia's voice cracks at times. He's hoarse. So what? On a good night he doesn't have a good voice. And Donna, if she hits a note that's not flat, congratulate her, good golly. That will go for every show. \n\nI get an impression that most of the critical commentators in these GD forums are not guitar players. I am a guitar player, a real one. And I love this show. Garcia is spectacular. His solos scintilate. They flow. There's a great funk & groove, each solo an improvisational story, a musical journey. Anyone can follow it, just pay attention to the notes, the music. Follow his winding melodies.\n\nPeople talk instead of listen, minds wander instead of focus. Hence, the negative comments. He's playing, they're jamming, sms you ain't listening. Your writings indicate as such.\n\nTo close, if the shoe fits, wear it. Take my observations in their entirety. What I'm writing is more of a review of the reviewers. It comes across -I'm sorry, to be didactic is my style and I can't change that- as a rebuke. It's a suggestion to listen with more than one set of ears. It's art, not a basketball game.",
