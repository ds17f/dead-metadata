Midnight Hour just rocking with a China Cat jam inside. But Baby Blue takes the cake (even though there are three pauses on this stream - music is all there). Always been my favorite BB. Bobby's noodling on the old Gibson ES is superb. Pig's organ extra churchy, combined with Jerry's voice gives this one my vote for most soulful (and therefore best) BB. Because of the music, and the fact that this is currently all there is to hear of this show - 5 stars.",

California had the best schools in the country in 1970...now they have the worst...ah, progress. \n\nI recommend using your EQ during playback of most of the shows on the IA, this one included.\n\nWindows Media Player has a 10 band EQ and SRS WOW effects that enhance the sound.\n\nHere's one way to stream/dowload this show:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer. \n\nRealPlayer is a free media player you can download at www.realplayer.com. \n\nUsing RealPlayer to view this webpage, click the VBR M3U link to open the songs in the Playlist.\n\nIf your Playlist is not open, open it by clicking the Playlist icon at the lower right hand corner of RealPlayer. \n\nOnce the songs are in the Playlist, double click the song to play it, then click the record button at the lower left hand corner of Realplayer to record it. \n\nWhen the red line reaches the other end click the stop button to download the song. \n\nYour song is in the RealPlayer Downloads folder. Repeat these steps for each song.\n\nOR \n\nyou could just hook up your audio cables from your computer to your cassette, VHS, CD, DVD or whatever \"recorder\" and record it in real time...OMG.\n\nEat, Drink, Be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD for tomorrow we may die.\n\nThanks for the LOVE from 1970.\n\nPS: Remember to click on the \"DeadLists Project\" link and get the Poster for this show.\n\nPSS: Get June 4,5,6, & 7, 1970 at the Fillmore West...all are on the archive.\n\nPSSS: if you want to rate my review feel free to use the Forum to vent your hate, opinion, and rants...I won't read em anyway...",

They are now out there in all of the usual places, but there's still room for improvement.  \n\nMany, many thanks to droncit, dusborne and germain.\n------------------------------------------------\nMy first trip to the Fillmore and also my first Grateful Dead show.  Am finally getting around to digitizing and editing tapes that I made that glorious summer night in SF.  A couple of cassette flips, a few tape breaks, some late starts and early applause cuts aside, it's pretty much the whole show; acoustic, NRPS and ELECTRIC DEAD!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe ACOUSTIC set list:\n\n1) Intro/a few million adjustments/while we're waiting for Pigpen\n2) (song that needs no introducton) Monkey and the Engineer\n3) Deep Elem Blues\n4) Candyman\n5) Silver Threads and Golden Needles\n6) Friend of the Devil\n7) Black Peter\n8) Cumberland Blues\n9) Wake Up Little Suzie\n10) Swing Low Sweet Chariot\n11) Uncle John's Band\n\nIt's a couple days later and I've just about completed the editing job.  Here's the ELECTRIC set list:\n\n1) Electrical Difficulty > Intro > Casey Jones\n2) Me and My Uncle\n3) Hard to Handle\n4) English Accent Dog (Not Yellow) Joke\n5) 999,999 Bottles of Beer\n6) It's a Sin\n7) China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider\n8) Attics of My Life\n9) It's a Man's World\n10) New, New Minglewood Blues\n11) Good Lovin'\n12) St. Stephen > Not Fade Away > Midnight Hour\n13) It's All Over Now Baby Blue\n\nNo encore that night, as \"Baby Blue\" calmed things down and the \"in for $3 Thursday night\" home audience was already completely satisfied, plus the Dead still had three more nights to play that weekend!\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nBurned most of the files to CD for playback in the car and on the home theater surround sound system.  Definitely crankable and it puts you on Fillmore floor, almost directly in front of the stage.  Sounds SO MUCH BETTER than on the laptop speakers used during editing.\n\nSony TC-124 single capstan portable cassette deck equipped with hand-held stereo microphone onto 120 minute BASF normal bias tape.  Did Dolby, chrome tape and auto-reverse even exist yet?  Pioneer CT-W900R dual capstan deck playback to PC equipped with a Soundblaster card and Audio Recorder for Free.
