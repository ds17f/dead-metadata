I have not been actively trading for a couple of years, so maybe this has been out for a little while? Either way, the show sounds great. A little bit of weirdness though in the way it is laid out. The first disc has the beginning of set 2 on it and then the encore tacked on to it at the end. I'm sure it was set up this way to fit everything onto two discs. I will most likely change the order and make a three disker out of it to keep the flow going.\n\nThis was a pretty solid show,. Not a mind bender or anything, but it was obvious they came to play. I was lucky enough to get some choice floor seats from GDTS, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. They also played Gloria at this one for the first time since 11/1/85. It's worth picking up.",

As for the encore, As my buddies and I were driving from Madison, WI, we were listening to among other shows, 11/1/85 and I placed a bet with the 4 other guys that Gloria WILL be busted at the Palace. Needless to say some of them were in the stands, while I was on the floor and they spotted me jumping like a freak.",

      "review_text": "Pace the Halls and Rock the Walls Me and some buddies from college drove up to this two night stand from UT Knoxville on spring break.  While everybody else went to the beach, we went to Detroit to hang out in a parking lot in 20 degree weather with snow on the ground.  Wouldn't trade the experience for the world.\n\nThe first night post-show was relatively placid.  However, we ran into a group of about 20 or so friends, also from Knoxville who, were staying in the Kingsley Inn just down the road.  In the name of solidarity, we moved our entourage to the Kingsley for the second night.  Talk about the right move to make!  It turned out that other than a small group of bewildered teenage basketball players, the whole place was filled with Deadheads!  Let the games begin!\n\nAfter the show that night, and a 20 minute ride in the open back of a pick-up in the freezing, sub 20s weather, we arrived back at the hotel.  There was a large sign situated in the lobby such that it was the first thing you saw when entering the hotel.  It read \u201cGrateful Dead concert goers:  Please go downstairs to the ballroom and stay there until you are ready to go back to your rooms and be quiet.\u201d  Sounded good to us.\n\nUpon arrival in the ballroom, I felt much like I had returned to The Palace.  The place was already decorated in the fashion which you would expect from Deadheads out to have a good time - balloons, streamers, tie-dyes, etc.  There was also a very large, well stocked, UNATTENDED bar along one wall.  Let me re-state that \u2013 a well stocked, UNATTENDED bar.  Needless to say, the locks on the booze were quickly dispensed with and there were free drinks for all.  I remember pacing the halls for most of the night with a bottle of champagne in one hand and two tall-boys in the other.\n\nThe hotel was laid out in two floors that both made complete loops, which seemed to encourage doing laps.  Everywhere you went were open doors, with implicit invitations to come on in and enjoy the fun.  It was like strolling down Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras.  Here you had the pub with the N2O tank hidden discreetly in the corner, there you had the laid back, low lights \u201ccasual\u201d bar.  And the crowning jewel, hidden somewhere on the second floor behind an ornate door, the Presidential Suite.  I\u2019m not sure exactly how it happened, but I became one of the elite with Presidential credentials.  Yes, the Deadheads had managed to infiltrate the Kingsley\u2019s crowning jewel.\n\nUpon admittance to the holiest of holies, I was pleased to find a group of 12 or so heads seated around an ornate conference table in leather bound chairs, listening to tapes of that night\u2019s show (possibly the very ones we have here) and using the large expanse of polished mahogany as the world\u2019s largest rolling tray.  Eventually, as was bound to happen, the bellboys showed up at the door.  To our amazement, they simply asked us to keep it down.  The second time they knock-knock-knocked upon our door, they said something to the effect of \u201cLook, we know you guys didn\u2019t rent this room, but we\u2019re going to let you stay here as long as you keep it down.\u201d  The third time was evidently just a bit too much and they finally evicted us. \n\nUpon returning to our room, I found that one of my friends had found it a bit too crowded and jumped from our balcony to the next room, which was previously unoccupied.  We had beds to ourselves and room service on the house.  Upon checking out the next morning, we passed a group of very unhappy looking corporate types with clipboards in hand on their way in.  Beating a hasty retreat, I reflected that we truly did pace the halls, rock the walls, and got out just before they blew.",

Other than that this show is strong. I wish bruce never brought that stupid accordian though. Masterpiece & Cold Rain would sound waaay better with him playing piano instead.",

The following night is as memorable as last weeks toast, so we had something to compare it to.\n\nI would rather have a great aud over a sbd any time, but since I no longer have the great aud I'll be content with this sbd. \n\n5 stars for the show, and with no qualifications, period.\n\nps- Jerry didn't leave the stage, and Bobby didn't hit his stacks...there was nothing but smiles onstage all night.\n\npps- that hotel gig sure sounds like it was fun...we drove home back to Ann Arbor and crashed.",

It was the first time that I thought \"uh oh, looks like something's up with Jerry\".\n\nThe Jack Straw opened up the show very nicely, but I thought there was some kind of weird tension onstage, as well.  \n\nI don't remember Jerry leaving the stage, or Weir kicking or hitting anything, there just seemed to be an edge between them that night.  \n\nThen the Gloria encore made EVERYBODY smile...including Jerry for the first time all night...",

      "review_text": "Do the Dew I keep comin' back to the Dew on this and I prefer to come back to it on my original cassette boot with a cool print of Mickey Hart on the jacket. I don't remember it having as many skips so maybe its just this version or maybe I just don't remember. Maybe its my computer buffering right now...who knows? Regardless, the Dew makes the show for me, always has. It was the first night of a 2-nighter at The Palace which was Bruce Hornsby's penultimate night as a 'member of the Dead' and he plays beautifully on the grand piano (primarily in your left ear). And Jerry goes for one idea after the other in his outro solo. And who gets tired of Jerry singing Morning Dew? Nobody I've ever known.",

Paul in the back of an S10 pickup truck with 4 buddies. We Had it well-stocked for comfort however with a bed topper as well so we didn't freeze.. I remember the people of Michigan not being really friendly to us kind folk but I guess we couldn't have everything. I felt that we did get everything and more at the first night of these two concerts while what unbelievable morning dew and it really reached out to me I don't know I guess I don't know how else to put it... The boys just nailed it all night. A good recording tho I don't care for how it's chopped up and slightly rearranged...kind of ruins the chronology of the event but the fidelity makes up for that absolutely. Cheers to Schwanee and Stymie and the two other cats I don't remember their names though they were all good company for this trip. I remember one guy forgot his ticket in st. Paul and didn't realize it until we got to Ann Arbor but was able to get a ticket in the lot \ud83d\ude04 5 stars \u262e",
