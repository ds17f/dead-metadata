(The Grateful Dead are the meaning of that term for those who aren't in the know). But, I don't know what all of the fuss is about the China Cat Sunflower/I know you rider in this show. It is not the best. It is pretty good but not the best. For the best China/Rider ever played (that I know of so far) refer to Their May 3,1972 show performed at the Olympic Theater in Paris France which is featured on the Europe 72 Album. There's no comparison. But, then again it may be a matter of taste and if you just so happen to have bad taste then yea, I could understand how you might think that this shows's china/rider was the best you've ever heard.

      "review_text": "Don't Miss This! I was happy to see these 2 lost (?) shows from Utica finally appear on LAMA. The first night 3/21  suffers from the flood damage (see text) but as far as I can tell, Set 2 is just fine except for some minor noise reduction. Certainly the Dark Star>Eyes makes it worthy of a listen or two.\nBut this night is the best and should be your first pick to DL.\nSet 1 is \"standard\" for 1973, which means that it's well played! Energetic versions of Jack Straw and Box of Rain, with another very decent vocal from Phil (who says he can't sing?) And what's amazing is how easily the Dead can shift gears within minutes from rock to country to lazy reggae to jazz without blinking an eye. Bird Song has some short, lovely jams from Jerry and Keith that sound  more like the prettier Dark Star moments. China>Rider is missing the opening notes, but delivered with conviction. Playin leaves the verse and immediately leaps into the minor key section with jazzy walking bass from Phil and fast bluegrass wah wah from Garcia whose guitar walks and talks, preaches and then mellows out before the reprise. Listen to Bill's fine drumming here!\n\nSet 2 is where they really stack the deck, and from HC Sunshine thru the end it's pure ecstacy. Sunshine, here barely a month old, features commanding leads from Jerry building up to the mid-song crescendo, and some nice Beatle-esque harmonies from the group. Truckin is over 13 minutes long, which means - they jam! Even Bobby remembers the words, and the jam includes some early \"Nobody's Fault\" riffs (the song doesn't appear until Sept. 73) before launching the Other One. Phil is up in the mix and drives the piece all the way, with Jerry switching on the wah wah at the 12 minute mark and quieting things down to some spacey weirdness. Then they kick (and i mean KICK) back into the verse before going to - Eyes where else? This is the 12th time played and by now, the song has legs with Garcia having found his style and the shifting major to minor sections are more tightly executed. Plus a full-fledged \"Slipknot\" section near the end that will be standard for years to come.\nFinally, with your brain sizzling in the frying pan, they ground you with an achingly beautiful China Doll. Listen to Jerry singing the high notes and the good background harmonies.\nAll in all, a great soundng show with many high points. I hesitate to rate 4 stars only because there are so many other great 4 star 1973 shows. So - 3 stars with a bullet!\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback ; -)",

Others have pointed out most of the details, including the brief Nobody's Fault tease, but I'd like to call attention to the end of Playin'.  Not only is the coda perfectly, heartrendingly done, but the whole reprise segment is played in double-time by Bill and Phil.  The double time by Bill is not that uncommon, but for Phil to pick it up at this point really kicks it into high gear.\n\nI think this really deserves about 4 1/2 stars.  On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being something from 95 and 10 being 10/30/73, 9/21/72, or take your pick, this checks in at about 9.0.",

I agree with Dr. Flashback and his analysis and review of these shows has never failed me but giving this a 3 is a bit modest given the power that blows out of your speakers on this....\n\nThere is so much unbelievable wailing on this. It is just one big line of high energy unparalleled musicality and should rightfully be judged on its own merits. China>Rider>Playin, You aint woman enough, Race is on, Sugaree, listen to Jerry on the slide in the Truckin>nobody's fault jam. This is a sick show - read what the guys that were there said. Music A+, Sound A+, positivity A+....\n\nI have reviewed more shows on this site than anyone else by a wide margin and this is a no-brainer. Fire up the 420 and enjoy this gem!\n\n*** This Other One at 29 mins is ridiculous and has to be heard it is never slow or tedious like some '73 and '74's and at times is incredibly intense with almost rehearsed precision - Phil gets a shout out for setting the pace early on in and they NEVER let up, oh maybe right before they blast into a 22:44 Eyes.. 52 mins between those two...

Listen to the re verb in Jerry's voice in the Paris show.  There is a ton of it. Re verb is essentially the reflection of the sound back to the mic.  So if it was there was naturally, with that much re verb, we should be able to hear a ton of crowd noise as well which we don't.  \n\nFor the China Rider itself, the Phil bombs in this one are amazing.  I was typing a paper in my school's library and nearly fell off my chair.  Jerry's solo in Rider, and his noodling in the jam section of China Cat are very unique.  The 72 one I would say is bland.  Though the drums kick it so perfectly, but then again the studio bias.  For the intensity I would pick this one, for the cleanliness I would take the 72 version.",

A special night at the Spectrum. \n\nThe first set contains a lush and poetical Bird Song that really spreads it's wings and takes flight to places you'll enjoy visiting.  While it may not be in the same class as 3/16 or 6/22 of this year, it's still a treasure to behold. A decent Jack Straw is executed before Phil offers his semi-sarcastic \"fire aisle\" rap. A nice China->Rider that's sadly cut at the beginning, keeps up the momentum before a very strong  Playin' (in typical '73 fashion) closes the first set.\n\nThe second set offers one even more tasty treats. A stellar Here Comes Sunshine will take you where you need to go (if you aren\u2019t there already).  This version (along with 2/15) are the best of the early versions before this song really took flight by the fall of the year.\n\nThe second set offers a meaty Truckin'->Nobody's Jam->The Other One->Eyes of the World->China Doll that flows right nice.  The highlight of the suite, however, is the glorious Other One which is among the best of the year.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Grateful Dead and Upstate New York seemed to have a happy marriage that commenced in the spring of 1970 and continued throughout the rest of their quarter century together, creating a nice fusion of perfect atmosphere, sound, and feeling.

      "review_text": "Pure Joy, 1973-03-22 It\u2019s the responsibility of the Dead to improve on technical standings of 1973, but even through the mid-Spring, I\u2019ve noticed, they take a seemingly unnoticed progression towards the cosmic. Outer-worlds of the NorthEast are smashed by jams previous tours could only dream of experiencing. Sure there was 1969 and sparse details in 1972. But, when the majority of time is spent in blues travels\u2026what time is left to pioneer? 30 minute Love-lights come to mind. That was their speed, back then. \n\nAlthough in this breath - of a wonderful time in their history, what else possibly could you ask for them to ponder, if not the intricate dimensions, pockets of information that are only discernible through the languid jams in these \u201873 songs. \nAs always, the second set is where the Meat+Potatoes can be found. However, the finale of the first set asks another interesting question. The statement is found in its answer. Maybe they weren\u2019t interested in starting anything at all, and the mysterious road to getting \u201cwarm\u201d is found when they\u2019re done playing. \n\nThat\u2019s always the marker of a great show in my opinion. When the band puts their instruments down, and throw up their hands in exhaustion \u2014 the creativity never stops (As they mention in 1977), but funneled through the experience of joint playing. As a single conglomerate membrane sifting through consciousness for some higher meaning. \n\nAs always, the Grateful Dead in their token year of pure joy, 1973. What\u2019s better, the sound and ability we all have to participate in their dream. \n\nPeace 2 All Beings ~ Nick. ",

      "review_text": "My Favorite Show Excited that today is the 50th anniversary of my favorite of all my Dead shows, Utica 3/22/73.  My friends and I drove from SUNY Binghamton to Utica on a lark, hearing there may be tickets for that night available.  We waited all day outside, bought deli sandwiches, to get in for the general admission show.  I remember a lot of pushing to get in, but we got right in the front of the stage.  Didn't know at the time (17 years old) that I would see the show of a lifetime.  The Dead pulled out all of their previous stuff (Box of Rain, Truckin', Deal, Loser, the Other One), with a lot of new stuff we had never heard before (Eyes, Sunshine, Stella Blue).  The first set itself was two hours!  Yes, there were problems with the crowd, as heard from the Dead announcements about trying to keep fire aisle.  Of course, the smoking was pervasive.  Yes, it was chaos, but to see the Dead up close at what I think was their peak in terms of musicianship was unforgettable.  Amazing that I, and you, can hear this again 50 years later for free, with great sound quality and realize that, yes it was THAT good.  Enjoy, and wish you were there!  Brad A., Long Island, NY",
