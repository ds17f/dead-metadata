      "review_text": "Higher on the mountain This is one of those instances where the tape sounds better than the show did.  Although it was a pleasant afternoon, the sound at the show was a little thin, probably because of the altitude.  But this SBD sounds amazing!  Scarlet-Fire is extremely hot, the Drums and Space are varied and interesting, and the Spanish Jam is lengthy and well developed, with all band members contributing variations on the theme.  It's really the only full-band Spanish Jam I know of, although there are probably others out there.  The Other One also deserves mention; it's very tight, with a nice intro from Phil.  Things kind of peter out after Wharf Rat, so it's not one of those shows that blows you away from start to finish.  But it's definitely worth downloading.\n\nAs for the live experience, again, it was an afternoon show (unlike the 1987 Park West show, which was at night).  The terrain made it difficult for any serious dancing; it is a ski slope after all.  Some time during the first set this guy parachuted into the show, landing up-hill from the soundboard.  I never figured out what that was all about; probably some kind of promotion, as he had a smoke jet attached to his back-pack.  During Women Are Smarter they had to replace Bobby's monitor mid-song.  That may explain why they went into Drums right after.  Some clouds gathered during space, but they broke right as The Wheel started, bathing the band in bright rays of sun.  The effect was quite dramatic and I remember thinking \"If only Candace could duplicate that.\"  All in all an enjoyable, but not intense, live concert experience.  The intensity happened a few days later at the Rocks.",

Even a kind of weak show in years between 74-85 is nothin less then top notch musicans playin good music on any given night. That would still warrant a 3 rating. Rate some of these acts that toured over the years and sit and listen to recordings with a fine tooth comb like we do with the Dead and you would find a lot of 0-2's.\n That being said I've been getting some killer Janes Addiction shows from the 87-91 tours and those are pretty kick ass. \n ps. Dave Navaro was a big Dead Head from what I read. Infact Perry Farell did that Ripple remake on that Deadicted cd which was kind of cool.",

      "review_text": "pleasant day This was a gorgeous Labor Day in front of the lodge at what is now called The Canyons.  The band faced the slopes and the crowd danced at the bottom of the run.  This was sparsely attended, perhaps the smallest crowd I'd seen (even Santa Fe drew a larger crowd).  I danced with plenty of room maybe twenty yards from the band.  And like the man said, even a weak show in '83 was a good show.  The energy was very chill, and it was still daylight during US Blues, so it was kind of a mellow picnic in the grass kind of atmosphere.  They had some sound problems; part of the drum jam went on without PA sound, but is seems the SBD hides it pretty well, and the audience was so small we could hear the drums just fine without amplification.  Honesty, I wouldn't have streamed this show except that I stumbled upon it and I was curious.  It was the only Saturday Night I'd heard on a Monday, I'll give it that.  The sunset drive heading toward Wyoming while cranking Exile on Mainstreet and the cliffs like skeletons spying on our 80 mph scene stands out as much as the show in my memory.  Fun day, so let's not get pissy about it.",

      "review_text": "1 More Labor Day Night...Little Show That Could <br />This one gets the rare 4 1/2-HG (4 & 1/2 stars-hidden gem). Look at that amazing set list. This has long been one of my favorite tapes and the show is in my top 5 attended, as well. A beautiful end-of-summer day. Park City was MUCH smaller back then (didn't stretch all the way to the interstate and no homes all over the hillsides) and I don't know if the show wasn't promoted well down in SLC or what, but this would be the LAST time I was at a show and only a couple thousand people came! Nobody was smushing in and you could meander about easily (just 4 years later this was all a story to tell). There were people who owned condos beside the stage who were privy to a different view as they partied on balconies and hung a cool \"Utah Dead\" banner for a mostly core-DEADicated audience.  The base of the ski area (The Canyons) has been rebuilt and shifted since then, but the stage was set up next to the old lodge deck and the crowd sat up towards where the gondola angle-station sits today.\n\nThe band was really flowing this day, start to finish, with a particular lilt permeating the music, most of which was uptempo. They played on a smallish stage that wasn't set very high, with a small PA. I never witnessed an atmosphere this laid-back again. Being in Utah had an opposite, sequestered effect from what you'd think (maybe also because this was the first time they didn't play down in town). This is my ideal setlist - all my '81-'86 faves are here. Ending 1st set with <i>Rider</i> and then coming back for <i>Scarlet>Fire</i> was immense after an intermission that resembled a group picnic, replete with some dude walking around passing out dosed Lemonheads (a friend of a friend was dosed for two days and was in my back seat for part of it, mumbling along to a song nobody else heard while we played Zep Presence). Everybody looked up at one point (the band too) to see a guy spiraling down in a parachute, smoke trailing his heels. It fit the music perfectly and for the effort he got a free show. Not that you couldn't hike in from the top of the runs if you really wanted to - though tickets at the window were only twelve bucks. There were a bunch of other weird events too (I admit the possibility I was the world's only witness). This was the first show where I wanted/was able to bring in an SLR. When I developed my slides I had shots of the stage that looked identical - just Bob and Jer playing. Then it came back to me. I had thought I'd take a \"picture\" of each SONG, and photograph the way <i>China Cat</i> felt; the way <i>The Other One</i> tasted. There were a dozen of these. Oh well, it's always 4:20 somewhere.\n\nIt was an all-daylight show and the parking lot scene raged into the evening and later; the first one where I noticed an increase in open vending (there was almost zero security at this show - a very mellow event, under the radar in Reagan's America), t-shirts & bumper stickers, etc., some I still have. Seems like the only show I went to where 50% of the crowd was trying to fund their next stop (the much bigger Dead market of Red Rocks). We were blasting Sandinista on the tailgate and this disturbed several hardcore heads wandering by (hehehe) - BITD when that genre was just too subversive - even for Deadheads. Try explaining that one to kids today. We had a motel room in nearby Coalville which was creepy and redneck after dark. We got edgy as we walked around in the early hours hoping to bump into some other D-heads but found only a staredown from a police cruiser (come to get you if you don't walk right). So at dawn we checked out under the watchful eye and moseyed for Colorado.\n\nThis would be the last week where I didn't mail order for tix, as that was just getting going, and the caravan on I-80 east to the Red Rocks show had plenty of odd synchronous events. Unfortunately, the people I was with have all passed on at this point. That's the way it goes sometimes I guess but the sounds of this day live on and I cherish them dearly as a convergence of best time at a show, small & soaring crowd and a high-qual performance. One of the best shows I went to, period, but also, looking back, 1983 was great because mainstream society was unaware of our existence. We'd been forgotten. History likes to think <i>Touch</i> changed everything but things were changing in '85 and even '84 was different than '83. This show's a great example of '83 and is better than 10/14 and 10/21. Four years later they played another hot show here (2nd set at night and triple the attendance).\n\n<b>First Set</b>. There are some PA problems during a smoking, uptempo <i>Bertha</i> that sets the pace for the show (use matrix source). Jer is on fire for <i>Promised Land</i> but the others are warming up - still hot though. This may be the best <i>Friend of the Devil</i> of '83. It's money. <i>Little Red Rooster</i> has highlights but Bobby's slide wasn't always contained. The middle of the set is average to above average. '83 was the first year for <i>Esau</i> and a couple dozen in it was still evolving; less so for <i>Hell in a Bucket</i>, even though this was only the 11th. <i>Althea</i> is a little labored and the low point of the show. It's always welcome but this wasn't the year for that one. The <i>China>Rider</i> is one of my faves, ever. Check Brent during China, but particularly check this version of Rider. It's insane.\n\n<b>Second Set</b>. It's also insane to come back from a China>Rider set closer and into a 27-minute <i>Scarlet>Fire</i>. I love a Scarlet where the solo goes another measure. It's tight and the last few minutes of the jam into Fire is perhaps my favorite-ever Scarlet segue. <i>Fire on the Mountain</i> is also good but doesn't go anywhere crazy - just tight. More speakers are blown for <i>Dewimmina</i> though the boys are game. Bill and Mickey play off, more than with each other, if that's how you like it, but the kick-ass <i>Space</i> has a classic <i>Spanish Jam</i>, into an above-average <i>Wheel</i>. <i>The Other One</i> hits a fever pitch and is one of the best versions from 83. Bobby Throws a Stone during the segue (they had just played it in Boise) but it goes into <i>Wharf Rat</i>. Average at first, it gets sent. The low point is <i>Around & Around</i> with Bobby sputtering and bailing, making up for it by going all in on <i>Saturday Night</i> (...Latter-Day night). He's really good on <i>US Blues</i>, which would be a top version if not for another speaker problem.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>; \u00a0B+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: A-\nOverall = 4 1/2 Stars\n\nHighlights:\nBertha - out of the gate, uptempo version\nFriend of the Devil - best of 83\nChina Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider - A good China (I L-O-V the final solo), Rider is bliss\nScarlet>Fire - 27 minutes of the year's best ScarFire jam\nSpace>Wheel>Other One - Bobby nudges Jer, they do the Spanish Jam long, Wheel soars, The Other One is a feverish version. Wharf is also a great part of this sequence.\n\nSOURCES: I had a clear AUD of this (which hasn't been uploaded) but my copy had a pitch problem and I had it taped over with a wack SBD that had a bad mix. The Miller SBD (117185) sounds better for some reason (different source?) but the SBDs have too much Brent keys and Jer mic. Now (finally!) there's an <u>Usborne matrix</u> which sounds better for much of the show (Bertha, Tennessee, Esau, Althea, Bucket, Fire ) with instrument clarity, balance, and has the correct pitch on Bertha, finally giving this show good service (though I wish it had more AUD ratio and more Phil). The work is being appreciated Dave!",

So much so, that I use it for background on my phone answering recording (in fact I changed from using Irvine from the next year to this one because it's a board) even though it kind of freaks out some folks who've never seen Grateful Dead and I know of one guy recently who had, but he had only once.\n      Anyway, there isn't a lot one can say about this show other than it's obvious attractiveness to hear the band it the mountains being a skier who has skied it Utah except not here. Given that it is a mountain it is fairly steep for a concert (but not to much to ski down) much in that respect like Red Rocks (although I didn't go to there this year) or the one time they played at the Boreal Ridge ski area in Ca. So given that, the clearest memory I have, (even though I know for those of you who both didn't go and are trying to decide if this is a good recording it says nothing of the sound etc. thus it isn't any help for which I apologize); but since under normal conditions one can never really see all of (unless I suppose if one at an indoor show in a small theater like perhaps the Warfield were in the balcony, which even when they played there I was still (although I hate to brag yet it is one of the few things in life I ever had consistent good luck with, so far) in the front as usual) what the drummers have at their disposal and are doing etc. that is, here I still see in color in my mind, Mickey with his brass bowls. Which also reminds me of, although I probably already mentioned it in the corresponding review (see Sante Fe (not just for my comments it's well worth it) the next weekend after this, after Red Rocks) on his birthday I talked to him about the steel drums he used to use in the late '70's which he late brought back out briefly!\n      Regarding the title of this review, perhaps I was mistaken, somehow in part maybe due given how in Weir's solo tune with the Midnights \"Salt Lake City\" it pokes fun at \"Mormon\" girls, I thought at the show it sounded to me like he was saying One more \"Latter\" Day Night, but yes I admit this was near Labor Day (although on a Sunday so not exact but I suppose close enough, which coinincidentally as I write this today is Labor Day) nevertheless; obviously whatever Weir was saying it was unusual and that's what makes shows easiest to remember if they otherwise were generic! Since it's a board of a show I went to I'm getting it in any case.\n   Rewriting this, I'm not mistaken indeed although, in the middle he clearly says \"Labor Day\" I've now confirmed that he also says either on the last or next to the last time \"Latter Day\" and at the beginning it's still hard to tell which one exactly he is saying!\n\n      Augy,\n      San Diego",

I think Bobby wore shorts. Totally chill venue and the crowd was so relaxed, plenty of room for dancing everywhere we were just feet from the stage. Energy level was really good for the whole show and we left happy and charged up, love this chill venue and this was one of the few times the dead played park west. It was daylight for most of the show and the surrounding views are spectacular, the air is crisp clear and the sky is big.",

      "review_text": "A 1983 Gem! 1983 seems to me such an uneven year for the GD.  Generally, the 1st sets are a bit flat, and the 2nd sets oscillate between brilliance and duds, without much in the way of middle ground.  \n\nBut this night has a bit of everything.  While Set 1 does indeed contain some typical \"1983-ness\" in the form of \"Althea\" and \"Little Red Rooster,\" the band is also cherry-picking some great 1st-set gems, including a rollicking opener with this version of \"Bertha\".  TJ, Hell, and the CCF->IKYR duo really round this one out.  \n\nAnd per above, the 2nd set dial was set on \"Brilliant\" this night.  This is one of those shows where the band seems to just be having a lot of fun, and it shows in the playing throughout the set.  The only complaint -- this set is about 10 minutes shorter than the typical 1983 show.  But given the goods delivered in the time that IS allotted, it's hard to be greedy here.\n\nSoundwise, this is one of the crisper SBDs I've heard.  This one just demands to be cranked at high volume.  Hard to believe I'm listening to a 1st gen recording here, but there you have it.  Definitely a show to hold up as an example of all the GD were still capable of in the mid-80's.",

I was born in 67 in SF. That little spark of magic that was going on that year was in me . \nI had no idea just what happened to me that day it was just life altering. My last show was LV NV 95.  I hadn't seen a show until dead and co came by a few years ago. \nI hadn't seriously listened to this show until yesterday. What a killer show that was . Thank you boys for turning me on and making my life a great adventure .   Thanks heads bros and sistaz.
