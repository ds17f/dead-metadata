      "review_text": "Fat 84 Sound My original review is below, and I hate to flame a fellow 'head, but the other review of this show is just pure unadultered horsesh*t.  First, the sound quality is great, clean SBD recording.  Second, the show itself is tight, well played (check out Jerry's leads during the um 17 freakin minute UJB), and out there.  I have more than 200 shows in my collection and I'd put this in the top 10. \n\nAlthough this version of 4/23 is a 2d set only, I highly recommend downloading it.  First, the sound quality is first rate, a very well mixed soundboard recording that captures each of the band members.  Second, and more importantly, the song selection and effort are A+.  The set starts out with a grungy Iko (as many were in 1984) that has a very funky beat, keep an ear open for Jer and Brent working their two man weave.  Weir's Sailor>Saint is one of the longer versions this reviewer has ever heard (total running time creeps over 15 minutes) and Weir's \"rapping\" toward the end of Sailor where he freestyles about drifting and dreaming etc is nicely done.  The real highlight of the set in my opinion is the LONG (17+ minute) Uncle John's Band .. after a brief intro and 1st verse, a lengthy 5 minute jam ensues that really lets the band explore the UJB theme.  Same is true after the last verse as Jerry and Brent tease China Doll and assorted other riffs before it looks like the drummers are going to settle in for their segment.  Mydland however busts out a very very rare (1st and only one ever) \"Only A Fool\" sans Jerry, Bob and Phil that really hits home.  Brent's lead organ with a very minimal drum line behind him give the song good emotional punch and it's well done, if a bit short (about 4 min.).\n\nThe back end includes a really trippy (again, weren't all 1984) Space that bleeds into a nice Spanish Jam.  Weir takes a lead with Truckin and Jerry responds with a nice Black Peter.  \n\nIt's unfortunate that the whole show does not circulate in SBD (for the completists among us, an AUD of the whole show is also posted here) because the 2d set is one of the best I have from this  underrated era.  \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

It's not exactly the tightest one ever performed, but it more than makes up for that with uniqueness out the wazoo.\n\nRest of the set is energetic, if somewhat standard fare for the time. Sound is a bit muddy, but that seems to be a symptom of quite a few '84 boards. Thanks to CM for yet another nice seed.",

      "review_text": "love the eighties I have jus begun listening to this morsel , and all i can say is i love what the boys did in the eighties. Ya ever realize Dicks Picks has virtually NO 80's shows in its library? I don't understand why. The *drums>space* portions of many 80's show definitly exhibited some creative flow and it bled right into the music itself. Brents organ playing , and on good nights, Jerrys guitar licks  - phil dropping bombs , and constant explorative drumming presented some of the finest music the Dead can offer, in my humble opinion. However, I am a junkie for this stuff, and could say the same about the 70's with Kieth and Donna, the 60's with PIg, and even the 90's with Bruce and Vince (yes later years with only Vince were a bit weak , but eh) . \n\nIn either case, this show thus far has been a real treat , and after  listening to the UJB...it's  17 minutes of gold :) The \"Only A Fool\" seems to be almost completely impromptu - i dont think anyone knew it was comin' , personally . Bobby , jerry , and phil had left stage , and mickey and billy dont seem to be exactly in sync at all times with what Brents got goin' on at the moment..leaves one to wonder if perhaps he had a message to send across to someone that night 0.o ?",

Now, in an attempt to \ngrab my five seconds of fame, I will pen the\nfirst Latin quote in these archives to date-\n\"De gustandibus non disputatum\" (do not quarrel\nover matters of taste).\n Amazing, eh, considering NOT ONE ancient Roman ever saw a Dead show ! Er, but back to the main\ntopic....\n\n This warped little musical odyssey is a puzzler.\nThe only way to explain this excursion is that\n(and I may be going out on a limb here) I am\nwilling to bet all members of the band took the\nidentical drug that night (which rarely happened)\nand too much of it (which happened all the time).\nThe result is a foggy, stumbling journey in which\nthe superb range of tonalities and remarkably\nconcise soundboard steal the show from a highly\nuneven performance by the lads.\n \n It's really more of a meditation/trance soundtrack than a show. Jerry seems much the \nworse for wear, playing miserably below his usual\nstandards, while a VERY careful and cautious Bob\nfeels his way along as Phil puts forth a somewhat\nasymmetrical, melodically emphatic effort that\nmakes one wonder if he's even at the same show.\n\n And yet....so strangely compelling, so eerie,\nso otherwordly. One is drawn into a strange\ndreamlike fugue as the band uses music to\nsculpt a representation of their communal\nmind-state.\n In this last regard this concert is a triumph.\nFor those Deadheads who most highly value the\nvirtuoso skills the boys are capable of presenting\nit is a laughable fiasco that saves itself in part\nonly by the remarkably coherent presentation of\nan alien artscape.\n\n I will give it two stars (one of the lowest ratings I have ever assigned) with an additional\nhidden star-and-a-half for the wicked, stoned\npleasure of it all.",

Yale had kicked me out by this time so it was the \"return of the native\" for me. It was a pleasure just seeing the boys back in town after my prolonged absence. It wasn't an outstanding performance but the ones in May of 1981 were the standout shows I saw there (both from the front row). During the Lazy Lightning of the May 11 show I literally saw blood boil on stage. But the band was later banned from playing in New Haven and then they imploded the Coliseum- a fitting end to what my sister once called a corrugated concrete box turned inside-out. Oh well.\n\n\np.s. My VERY FIRST review. I have been hanging out here since 2002 and downloaded about 800 SB's when they were available but hadn't registered a user name till recently (I was having trouble streaming shows and contacted the Administrator- turns out I am not the only one having this problem).\n\nWell and good night.

For being the lull of 84' (I consider the later half of the year to be much better) this show is a stand out better than some of the others. \n\nYes its obvious Garcia is deteriorated vocally and musically but him and the band are experimenting with longer and balsier jams than normal. A bit dark, but then again, it seemed to be dark times. \n\nThe July Greek shows seemed to be the turn around point for 84', but this one is definitely one of the better shows of the Spring.\n\nI generally think 85' was a much better year, with 86' going really downhill into, well obviously..... \n\nThere may be a cassette generation or two in the mix which might make the sound quality not the best Miller transfer, but still certainly worth a listen thru, and probably a download.",

But enuff on that... the music is what matters.  Spring '84 paled in comparison to fall '84 [check out the monstrous 10/14 & 10/15 shows in Hartford], but it really wasn't as bad as folks say.  I think the playing on Jack Straw, Sugaree, and Duprees are stellar.  And other than not being a fan of '83 and '84 Hell in a Bucket's, enjoyed the rest of the first set - - even if only 6 tunes.  Second set wasn't all that tight, but other than Brent's tune before the drumz, and the Day Job encore, I liked the tune selection and enjoyed dancing with my wife [now of 28+ years].  And, as I've said before when reviewing shows from '95, I'd give a lung to hear Jerry live one last time- -even if not on his best night.",

Beforehand; ask Kurt! He'll vouch. And if he should find this review, Its a fond if brittle memory.\nAnd after listening to the recording - I had it years ago but don't recall it making much of an impression - I echo comments of a few earlier reviews. Weird and interesting at times, unfocussed and bizarre at others, and sometimes a mixture of the two (a matrix of quality, y'know one of those with four sources!)\u2026but probably worth a listen, or even two! The more I listen, the more I enjoy it....but there's better\nVerylazylightning's review before sums it up well for me - and made me change the rating... I feel as though this is what we went to see/hear/experience for a Dead concert; a musical journey with a willingness to follow to where they lead!",
