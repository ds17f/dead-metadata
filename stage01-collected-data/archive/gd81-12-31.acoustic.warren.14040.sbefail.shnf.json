      "review_text": "4 SETS!!!!!, Are you kidding me???? I attended every New years show from '80 to '88 and this was by far the best IMO. Between the incredible song list and the inspired playing from start to finish, this show rates as one of the best ever!!!\n\nFirst i have to point out that Jerry did indeed break out the Accoustic guitar for Banks Of the Ohio, but by the end of the first verse had traded it in for his electric.\nThis is the only 4-set show I ever attended, and it was a mind blower. The best time I ever had at a show. As you walked in the Auditorium, there was a floor mural dedicated to Truckin from the year before, when the floor had caved in due to the dancing during Truckin. Graham had a mini volleyball tourney going on before the show inside. \nTo me this show had everything. a killer song list, just about everything you could want to hear with some very sweet surprises. One of the greatest Shakedowns opening up the 2nd set, a nice Big Boss Man (\" I sure Go to barn at night!!)the only distraction of the set was Joan Baez singing overpowering harmony during Roses. The third set is epic. A nice rollicking Aiko, followed by a great Playing >> Terrapin >> Playin sandwich (\"Strategy was his strength, not \"Didaster\"\") But the real treats were left for after drums and the 4th set. It was reminiscent , both song list and playing, of a 70-72 jam. The space is long and inspired with Jerry absolutely taking the lead and flows effortlessly into a mean Other One > NFA.> Goin Down the Road, which warmed us up for a truly inspiring Dew that soared through the darkness, and perfectly ended the set, leaving us with anticipation for what might come.\n When the boys came out again, I think many were expecting a short extended encore, but, man were we in for a surprise. The whole place erupted as Phil and Jerry broke out the intro to Dark Star. this is a fairly short Star, about 14 min, but quite inspired, with some very sweet leads and interplay with the band, and segueing into a rocking Bertha/Good love. The lowlight of the evening was Baby Blue, nicely played, but with Joan once agin providing overpowering, annoying harmonies.This show to me is the quintessential Dead show, great song selection, great musicianship and 4 sets.",

      "review_text": "Is Joan Baez really necessary? This is possibly the most soulless Bobby McGee ever recorded by anyone, and the rest of the set isn't much better.  Children of the 80's?  Please... \nThe sound quality is also pretty marginal.  It sounds like a mediocre AUD to me, with a lot of hiss and distortion, along with a general lack of presence. If you've gotta have every song the Dead played, go ahead, but otherwise don't bother.",

Jerry, in particular, was really not into the concept.",

Believe it or not, this was my first show, and needless to say, it set the bar pretty high. \n\nI can't add much to what has already been written, as it is an excellent show and should be a part of everyone's collection. As an attendee, I only wish I had more shows under my belt before attending this one, as I could have appreciated it more. Still, it was a fantastic evening of music and adventure -- this show kicked ass from start to finish, and then Bill Graham fed us breakfast afterwards. A truly unbelievable evening.\n\nI ended up seeing approx. 240 shows between this one and the last Shoreline show I saw in 1995. Looking back on this night 25 years later, this was definitely one of the very best, a true one percenter. Thank you, boys, for a REAL good time :-)",

      "review_text": "Check out the other soundboard for Sets #2-4 THIS SHOW FRICKING KICKS ASS, MATE!!  RFKROX IN 'DA HOUSE!!\n\nThis show is, without a doubt, one of the smoothest and clearest shows I\u2019ve ever heard!  If I had of attended this show, I would have been stoned-to-da-bone, jammin\u2019, dancin\u2019, and cruisin\u2019 all night long, man!  5 stars and A+ recording quality, for sure.\n\nI\u2019m rating this show from the 2nd set on.   Shakedown Street is off-the-hook to start this set!  One of the best versions I\u2019ve ever heard, and 16-1/2 minutes long!  For all the hoopla about the 70\u2019s Dead (which is certainly warranted), these early 80\u2019s shows were awesome, especially with Brent Mydland finding his groove.  All of these songs are awesome in Sets #2-4.  Me and My Uncle, Mexicali Blues, Cold Rain and Snow, and Big Boss Man really put Set #2 in high gear.  The third set is absolutely amazing starting with Iko Iko after the countdown to New Year\u2019s, then steamrolling into Playin\u2019 > Terrapin > Playin\u2019 Reprise.  This Drums > Space is unique because it has Jerry playing some cool mellow space guitar before storming into The Other One > NFA > GDTRFB, while ending the set with an awesome Dew (maybe one of the best ever?).\n\nAnd what can you say about Set #4?  Dark Star > Bertha > Good Lovin\u2019 is absolutely ridiculous!!  Just sic, man!!  Even the encore is sweet, with the Boys hooking up with Joan Baez in Dylan\u2019s classic, \u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now, Baby Blue.\u201d\n\nI agree with Purple Gel in his review on this show.  This just may be the best New Year\u2019s show between 1980-1988.  He said he attended all of them, so that\u2019s pretty impressive.  Moreover, it certainly makes him a reputable authority to review those shows.  Wish I could have said that.  However, I do disagree with his assessment about the encore with Baez.  I actually enjoy listening to her vocals on that song (unlike listening to Donna wailing away on some of the early-mid 70\u2019s Dead shows).  Donna\u2019s best harmonies were clearly during the 1977 peak year before she was booted out of the band with her brother, Keith, after the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum show on 02-17-1979.\n\nI live on the East Coast, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see any of those New Year\u2019s shows that Purple Gel alluded to.  In fact, my first show was at RFK Stadium in D.C. (saw the 6-9 and 6-10-73 shows) and didn\u2019t attend another Dead show until Dylan, Tom Patty, and the Dead played at RFK Stadium on July 6-7, 1986.  Man, was it hot as shit that weekend!  100 degrees!  I only attended 6 Grateful Dead shows, but have seen the Dead 6 times post-Garcia.  5 of those times were at Red Rocks in Colorado in the summer of 2003 (July 6, 7, 8, 10, 11).  Man were those some awesome shows with Joan Osborne!  Talk about a Rocky Mountain High!!  LOL\n\nAnyway, if you want an awesome show with all these amazing sets, then you should download the soundboard.  The energy and sound quality are off-the-hook!  Can\u2019t go wrong with a Grateful Dead New Year\u2019s show!\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",
