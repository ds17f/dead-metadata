The Warehouse was surrounded by police all three nights, but that didn't stop some fearless  and reckless  insider from dispensing a large amount of LSD to the crowds on hand and, in the words of Rolling Stone, \"the bands blew the lid off the house.\" A few weeks later, Bill Graham put on a bust benefit show at Winterland featuring the Airplane (who had been busted at the same New Orleans hotel a couple of weeks before the Dead), Quicksilver, Santana and It's A Beautiful Day. After expenses, the show raised $15,000, which was enough to cover the initial legal expenses after the bust.",

Bobby also adds his pipes at about 36 minutes.\n\nThe final comment by one of the announcers after the last notes decay sums it up pretty well....",
