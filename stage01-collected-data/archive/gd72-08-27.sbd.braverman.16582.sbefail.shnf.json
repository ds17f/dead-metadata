At the time it was barely listenable, but the music was sooo hot I had to have it. Now this source is excellent and I'm sure it about as good as it gets for now until the much rumored and promised official release of the Sunshine Daydream Video finally comes out. I do see that Jay Ashley released a Bertha upgrade. That should be very nice!\nThere has been plenty written about this show. John Dwork wrote an excellent review in DDN and the Deadhead's Taping Compendium. All that you have heard about this show is true. This represents the Dead's greatest triumph. The music is played at an unmatched level of intensity, Particularly the China Cat>Rider (A rollicking goodtime) the Playing (absolutly breathtaking)and the Dark Star( a mind boggling musical journey)! 1972 was a excellant year for the Dead, there are dozens of hot shows, and unbelievable Dark Stars, Playings, Other Ones ect.. But this show stands out above all others. D/L it and savor it!!! You will not be disappointed!!",

I streamed the show, and the Promise was broken as it was not there.  Not to worry.  Plenty of good grooves lie ahead.  About 1/4 of the way thru China/Rider, I broke my Hi E, (first broken string really playin since 89').  Not the greatest C/R, but it certainly got me off!~  To me, its all about that moment.  Not the entire lead, song, or show, just that sudden explosion you feel, that makes it all worthwhile. I cannot count how many times they have brought me there.  Time and time again, GD envelopes me, in what the rest of my life cannot provide.

It was a hot day in Oregon, over 100 degrees farenheit, but this amazingly had almost no effect on the tuning of the Dead's instruments. In fact, the group's intonation is consistently excellent. There are several landmark Dead performances of songs such as \"Bird Song,\" \"Playin',\" \"Greatest Story,\" \"Jack Straw,\" \"Dark Star,\" and \"Sugar Magnolia.\" Is the \"Sunshine Daydream\" coda used to any more appropriate effect than it is here? I didn't think so, because this show really was a sunshine daydream in itself.\n\nThe SBD recording, it being a Betty board, is fabulous as usual. You are not going to believe this show when you play it through a good set of speakers and a subwoofer. Or better yet, try and find a pirated copy of the Sunshine Daydream movie. Perfection.",

The weather is hot -> the band is hot.\n\nWith the possible exception of I Know You Rider, the song selection is perfectly back and forth between Bobby and Jerry.  The only possible misfire in the song selection (in my humble opinion) is the Dark Star->El Paso.\n\nShould have been a Morning Dew.  You can hear Jerry trying to make it happen but Bobby isn't having any of it.  So what might have been the best Morning Dew ever becomes a rather ordinary version of El Paso.  So it goes!  Take what you need.\n\n-------\n\nAdded note to CEK Feb 2015:  you forgot Xhol Caravan, the great German band from the late 60s/early 70s, who regularly improvised their way into some very groovy Dead-like territory (without guitar solos!); and, of course, the legendary Gong (who, along with the Dead and the Pink Fairies, contributed the best sides to the Glastonbury Fayre 3LP).

Any one notice after he messes up the opening verse that he sings alternate lyrics...or am I just going nuts?  It sounds like he says \"running around, this clover leaf town\"  I'm uncertain about the running around part, but I am certain he does not sing \"I'm running aground\" am am pretty certain he says \"clover leaf town.\"\n\nCan anyone correct me?  Does anyone have any notes on that?  I know it's different than the alternate lyrics sung in 1990.\n\nJust wondering if I'm the only one that wonders about that.\n\npeace\n\n*****As for the show itself, IMHO this is certainly a top ten GD performance, almost perfect all the way through, 5 starts for sure.  Great song selection, Keith rips on an unbelievable 'Playin' In The Band,' Jerry being Jerry : ), Phil and Billy keep things very tight all day and night long.  I love this show very much, I never tire of it.  The China > Ryder is nice and smooth.\n\nI understand how some would have liked to hear a 'Dew' come out of 'Dark Star.'  It seemed that's where the band was going as you hear Phil's pre-dew distorted bass, and even the intro licks by Jerry.  But then Bobby (and Billy) take a sharp turn as they quickly head in a completely different direction.  I really don't mind the 'El Paso' as I tend to dig the odd combos when they come and really shows the bands versatility and ability to improvise.\n\nMy only real dissatisfaction with the show is the encore.  I'm unhappy with Jerry's choice of 'Casey Jones' and feel Bobby's 'One More Saturday Night' is was too predictable...oh well...can I imagine???...brokedown, black peter, ripple, dire wolf...???",

Right from \"Go\" the boys are on fire, really delivering under pressure (the heat is alluded to many times throughout three sets). The playing is extraordinarily tight, concrete setlist (\"Bird Song\" flies into the stratosphere), and the M.C. Ken Babbs (along with Bobby's heckling of him) is really great.\n\nIf nothing else, you'll be hard pressed to find a finer \"Playin'\", even more so to find a show with such a caliber \"Dark Star\" too!\n\nThe festivities were filmed, too, by Kesey & his crew. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they ever released it commercially, though you can find clips online. If anyone has any knowledge of how to get a copy (seeding or uploaded) I'd be extremely Grateful!\n\nPeace, enjoy the show.",

One of those jams that makes you realize why Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine cite him as an influence. I've often wondered if the Dead were turned onto the freakier progressive/psychedelic rock coming out of Europe and South America around this era which put the vast majority of American music to shame. Sure, the Dead and the Velvet Underground could wig out with the best of them, but beyond them you're hard pressed to find Americans who could hold a candle to the dense psychedelic masterpieces being cranked out of France and Germany on a weekly basis. The dissonant cyclones Garcia unleashes in this jam hints that he's turned on to the King Crimsons, Soft Machines, Clusters, Ash Ra Temples, Magmas, etc. I wonder if the shared lineage tracing back to Stockhausen allowed the Dead to dose out listening to Ege Bamyasi or Neu! before most American heads even realized that music was progressing way beyond the lemon drops and peppermints psychedelia of the 60s?\n\nThe Dead were rampaging through Europe right as it was having it's first huge year on the weird music scene.\nAmerica's big contributions were via jazz, Miles dropping On The Corner, Ornette with Science Fiction, Mtume Umoja Ensemble 's Land of the Blacks, Alice Coltranes World Galaxy, Pharaoh Sanders with Black Unity, Donald Byrd's Ethiopian Knights, McCoy Tyner's Sahara.. tons of stuff on Strata-East and Black Jazz proving anyone who said jazz died in the 70s is deaf or a liar..Their transcendental repetition reflecting back what was going on across the Atlantic from Fela Kuti in Nigeria to Kraftwerk in Germany, setting the stage for a whole new repetitive, rhythmic form of expression that would dominate the next 40 years of music. Oh, and Steve Reich's Drumming. The god of minimalism. Mind melting.\n\nIn Germany 72 was the year krautrock went for broke with Tangerine Dream, Ash Ra Tempel, Can, Neu!, Out of Focus, Agitation Free, Grobschnitt, Twenty Six Six And Then, Popul Vuh, Embryo, Amon Duul II, Faust, Klaus Schulze, releasing masterpieces. Italy discovered their own mindbending sound with the romantic avant-garde tinged symphonic progressive music of Le Orme, Premiata Forneria Marconi, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Quella Vecchia Locanda, Il Balletto di Bronzo, Alan Sorrenti.. England had King Crimson putting in their chip for the \"best band in the world\" title (which they probably won for a few months here and there a couple times) and a lot of other bands followed the Dead's lead (probably not consciously) looking towards folky fantasy with Genesis, Gentle Giant, Hawkwind, Khan, Uriah Heep, Strawbs, Jethro Tull, Wishbone Ash, Soft Machine had just came with Fifth and Pink Floyd just dropped Echoes and blew everyones brains even if they had no idea of the crazy music going on under the surface.\n\nAnd then France, ah France. Catherine Ribeiro + Alpes with folk music that made Workingman's Dead feel about as psychedelic as the Smothers Brothers, Moving Gelatine Plates came with the World of Genius Hans, imo one of the 25 best albums ever made. like trippy music? listen to THAT! Jean-Claude Vannier's L'enfant assassin des mouches\" taking the work he did with Serge Gainsbourg and blowing it up to bizarre lysergic sex dream proportions, Arachnoid's terrifying space jams weren't released until 1979 but were recorded around this time, the pastoral sounds of Atoll mirroring what Genesis and their ilk were up to in the UK, Cyrille Verdeaux's Clearlight Symphony, two 20+ minute slabs of methodically mutating genius that will take you to places you've never dreamed, Carpe Diem blending the Canterbury sound of Soft Machine & Camel with the more avant-garde leaning Zeuhl sounds of France. Ah, that old keyword \"Zeuhl\" which doesn't actually translate to, but might as well translate to \"French people who were borderline acid casualties who made jazzy rock music weierder than anyone in America was even dreaming of\"- i mean, this stuff probably had Zappa's jaw on the floor. And not in a quasi-obnoxious way like Beefheart, just in a straight up expressway to your skull. \n\nNot sure when they came out, but Lard Free, Flamen Dialis, Univers Zero, Eskaton, ZAO, Weidorje, are some french bands who will push you over the edge and turn you into a fiend for this music. \n\nRichard Pinhas & Heldon prefiguring the Disco Biscuits by about 20 years (but slacking behind Kraftwerk & Tangerine Dream in the dance synths plus guitar decathalon, Heldon is still super bad and will get your brain racing your feet) Shylock and Skyrvania have some spectacular riffs and an amateur feel thats super ingratiating.\n\nAnd then there's Magma. The creators of Zeuhl and one of the most singularly original bands in the history of music. Mekan\u00efk Destrukt\u00efw Kommand\u00f6h is a safe bet for being an album that makes you say \"I have never heard anything like this. And I love it\" - simultaneously dissonant, choral, improvisational and highly composed. ooh. wee!\n\nSo yeah.. I just kinda wanted to come in here and throw out a massive list of bands that one could dip into if they ever feel like shifting away from the jambands for a minute and trying out some new old music that was bursting with creativity at the same time as the Dead. Imagining the Dead in Europe going from town to town and absorbing all this insane music is so fun.\n\nI've long been concerned that Deadheads can get a little myopic with their favorite groups. So myhope is that everyone who reads this decides to randomly check out at least one album on here and has their mind blown to smithereens. i'm talking smoking crater. Poor prog rock got a terrible reputation from its most popular groups pomposity and elitism. This post tries to illuminate the other side of the coin, weird nerds wearing dresses and warpaint but also turning classical, jazz, rock, funk and avant garde into a potent concoction.",
