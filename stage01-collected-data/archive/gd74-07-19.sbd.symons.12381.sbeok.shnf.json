Garcia and Lesh intertwine like lightning and thunder.  \n\nThen it gets serious.  Very serious.  As serious as it's every gotten with any band who has ever picked up instruments and tried to play them as a unit.\n\nThe Spanish jam, led by Lesh is just downright stunning.  It's what this band is all about and something that every fan should hear, but new fans should probably wait a bit before listening to something this heavy, this thick.  It can be quite scary for the uninitiated.\n\nThen the Eyes is wonderful and the Doll is a perfect way to finish it off, even though the Doll can't come close to matching the perfection of what was played before it.\n\nA historic passage starting at the Weather Report Prelude and ending at the Doll.\nDstone5553@aol.com",

The show starts out with Bertha, unfortunately, the song is lacking its guitar sound in the mix, but oddly enough, it still sounds spectacular. The guitars come up on the next song and they stay there for the rest of the show. \n\nThis show features one of the best sounding beat it on down the line and row jimmys I've ever heard, and Donna sounds just wonderful. Me and Bobby McGee sounds really cool the way Bob and Donna sing it and it goes on and on without very much in the way of a disappointment. This is a must have show. Its a wonderful sounding one. He's gone and china doll are favorites of mine that really standout, but the whole show is just absolutely fantastic.  \n\nOn the down side there's a audience splice close to the end of row jimmy that must have been used to patch it, but it not too bad cause its very brief, and the Encore of one more Saturday night is from an audience tape as well. Other than that, this is a 5 star show.",

I mean this is a great recording, although it kept cutting out and in during the latter part of the second set which was a bit annoying, but the song selection, and most importantly the playing are fantastic.  I see now why there are such rave reviews about '74 Dead, this, I think, was their prime.",

      "review_text": "good stuff Oddly enough, this show did not grab me like others from '74 do. I know it's at the top of most people's list from this year, and perhaps it will grow on me, but right now I feel that there are other shows that outshine it.\n\nThat being said, it's got great energy and plenty of serious jamming... The ten minute opener is a great little thing (probably a soundcheck, but who knows). The whole first set is more than solid; Bertha wasn't great (by my standards anyway) but everything from Mexicali through Playing was fantastic, especially Row Jimmy and Scarlet Begonias.\n\nThe Playing in the Band here is KICKASS. It's a full half hour and touches on several different grounds. I was sad they didn't seg into something else, but it's a wonderful, compact jam.\n\nThe second set is great (skip the Seastones, though...), with Brown-Eyed Women being a great energy boost to start it off. Things get sweet with It Must Have Been The Roses, and the He's Gone > US Blues is great, with an unexpectedly spacey seg in between the two. The WRS through China Doll is fantastic too. Spanish Jam here is one of the best.\n\nSo, why was I not COMPLETELY blown away by this? Not sure... Maybe the jams just weren't QUITE my thing, or maybe my ear has temporarily become numb to the sound of 1974. But this sort of thing is awfully subjective. My suggestion - get this legendary show, and decide whether it is YOUR thing or not afterwards. It definitely has the potential to be.",

      "review_text": "Revised 9/9/10 Well after spending a lot more time with this show over many months i've come to realize that its definitely one of the best of the year. of course like almost any show there are a few weaker tracks, but there are just too many great moments to ignore. one being the fantastic Scarlet in the 1st set that probably is the best version of 1974. it's really unique too b/c JG kicks in some sick distortion for the first part of the jam; can't say i've heard another example of that before. \n\nwhile i don't find the opening 'jam' to be all that interesting, there are plenty of other great little songs in the 1st set, too, like Deal, BIODTL, and Tennessee Jed, and as other reviewers have said, a spectacular Playin' where phil really lets loose.\n\nwhich is nothing compared to the ridiculous 2nd set, where he just goes crazy...was this his best year or what?!  again, like everyone else i have nothing but praise for the monster jam of WRS>Spanish>Eyes>China. the WRS is the hands down winner for best ever, and the Spanish is also easily the best of the many in '74. and despite the minor key sections of Eyes being a bit wobbly, phil's soloing makes it a fantastically unique version that ranks among the greatest ever played as well.\n\ngreat, great GREAT show indeed...",

Nobody hated her until they heard her wailing and shrieking on PITB, OMSN, TMNS, SAD, DITS and many other acronyms.  She didn't have a monitor?!?  They should have held back on the microphone as well.  She has earned all criticisms thrown in her direction.",

      "review_text": "A mixed bag, overall fantastic First, the criticism: smgarcia below writes of the numerous missed entries, foul notes, and various boners in this show.  I must admit he is right; this show is downright sloppy in many places and the slipshop errors are more than a little distracting. A good example is Here Comes Sunshine, which is painfully messy and hard on the ears.  Jerry's tone was brilliant, but the song oscillated between fantastic and amateurish from one moment to the next.\nNow for the praise: even with all the miscues, much of the playing in this show is creative and brilliant.  Everyone had shining moments,and it was even a pretty good show for Donna.  Bobby McGee was very good, Scarlet was on fire, and even El Paso was performed well. The WRS was quite good, but the Eyes of the World was stunning!\nThere was plenty of fine playing and magic in this show.  If not for the unusual number and severity of buzz-killing errors, it would have easily been a five skull show.  I gotta give it a four.",

Ned closes out the proceedings with a series of ring-modulated sample-and-hold sequences. A must-listen for Phil fans. This is Lesh at his most deliciously self-indulgent, if not the most triumphant collective improvisation.",
