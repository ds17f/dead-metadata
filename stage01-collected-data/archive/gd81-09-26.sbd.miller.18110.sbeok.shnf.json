So they owed us a bit when they finally arrived. The first set was quite respectable: decent Shakedown, Jack-a-Roe, Brown Eyed, Let It Grow. But the real payoff began at set 2 with the Playin>Bertha. They came on stage quickly like they meant business and immediately got into deep psychedelia during Playin. Bobby goes bananas with some weird rythmn and Garcia is racing to keep up. Their joy going into Bertha was quite infectious and you could see them all smiling at each other, even when Bobby minorly missed one of the climaxes. Jerry's Dew is hard edged and energetic. After the show, some lost blonde girl was wandering around our car muttering about \"the dew, the dew...\" I sort of felt that way, too. Everyone talks about the Melk Weg, but I think the second set of Buffalo 81 deserves a listen.",

      "review_text": "So Glad We Made It! Not much to add to all the other raves, except to say I should have returned to New Paltz feeling totally satisfied and blown off Landover. This one built on a fine, though not exceptional, Lehigh show the night before, and if memory serves, the delay in letting us into the Aud was more like an hour and a half, with the show being almost two hours late getting started.\n\nBut the payoff was just too sweet! They just set the place on fire from note one, and could do no wrong in the 2nd set. Though it wasn't our original plan, I was duly motivated to convince my travelling companions to join me in making the all night drive to the DC area 'cause I just knew they would top themselves and complete the trifecta. (Not that they needed much arm-twisting...)\n\nBut NOOOOOOO! (See CapCentre review for more.)",

Great Morning Dew. \nMy friends and I Jumped on the subway (bus?) at UB.  Everyone in a great mood, Dead tonight followed by a House party and the Stones at Rich stadium Tomorrow!  All of us dropped the big A that night.  We had great floor seats.  I can still remember a girl, obviosly having a bad trip, freeking out on the right side facing the stage in about the 10th row....My friends Girlfriend, Bonny, asked us why we didn't go over and help her...answer...because I don't want to end up like her!  To every ones pleasure they opened with Shakedown and we were on our way.  The Second Set is amazing with a playing, Playing reprise enveloping an amazing song selection including a morning dew worth writing home to mamma about.  Enjoy this show  it's Great",

To me the '81 Dews are among the best ever. the first jam is dark and angry and the final jam starts off slow, sweet and oh so sad and builds to it's climax.Check out the 9-11 Dew for another sweet, sweet jam.",

I still live a few miles away from the old Aud, which is now boarded up. My friends and I slept outside on the grass to get tickets for this show, and ended up with 9th row, Jerry side, which of course, when we all moved our seats forward, ending up about 4th row! We stood on our seats anyway. I remember feeling so proud the day of the show to have all the visiting deadheads in my city, and I talked to many of them. I give this show 5 stars for sentimental reasons, although it WAS a very good concert. Morning Dew was my favorite song, so of course I was thrilled when Jerry started playing, and it was awesome being able to see his facial expressions so close as he played. Thanks for including this, haven't heard it in many years, and it sends shivers up my spine!",

      "review_text": "first show Caution: THIS IS NOT A REVIEW of the music per se.... more of a blog .... an account (as best I recall) of MY EXPERIENCE.  Please humor me... this was my 1st of many, many shows and being new to archive... the FIRST I have heard this since 9/26/1981.\n\nHere at 42 y/o... 1981 and the 11th grade seem like an eternity ago.  Took the orange '72 bug on the ride from Warren, PA with good friend Bill and his hippie hot sister Jennifer.  I recall that we stayed the nite in a small motel...no clue where.\n\nI'm 16 and maybe a little intimidated by SO MANY SMILES... like I'd never seen before.  A BIG and WONDERFUL eye opener and likely responsible for turning me from the dark to the light.\n\n Uncle Clair (Buffalo, NY US postman) had gotten tired already of my mum bugging him for me to get me tickets to different shows so he had hooked me up w/ a little post card that came to the house giving me shot at early bird seats via FESTIVAL tickets.  Scored the 3 of us seats on the floor (17th row as I recall).\n\n  Amazed to see all the teamwork of people taking down all the floor folding chairs and stacking into mini chair columns (in order to make more dancing room.)  Another's account here regarding the show's delay suggests maybe it was the delay that led to this inspiration. \n\n All I had ever really remembered - shakedown - (what I'd been recalling for years as the 20 minute shakedown opening) actually happened!  I was off a little w/ the time but the story heretofore stands corrected. \n\n I don't know what was in the clear punch handed to me and drank while waiting to get in and I really still think this unrelated BUT.... I still also remember a point in the show (SCARY AS HELL AT THE TIME) where CNS began to fail, stumbling in a steadily closing tunnel 'til I made my way to the back of the aud.  Getting some clear air seemed to bring me back.  Made way back to seats and recall enjoying the bejesus out of remainder of show.  Trying at moment to discern moment of less consciousness by listening to sets.  \n\nBack to the hotel (via the Falls?), probably tried hitting on Bill's sister and most likely got shut down.  \n\nThe Stones at Rich stadium the next day... never really crossed our minds.... although we definitely knew about it.\n\nTicket stub and somewhere in this ol house... a baseball style shirt, gray w/ maroon sleeves, well worn with a blue rose on the front.\n\nGod bless the taper who posed this.",

His leads during Looks Like Rain and Let It Grow are especially stellar and both his vocals and guitar on They Love Each Other are really sweet. The second set starts off with a powerful and psychedelic Playing and for the rest of the set the band is on fire. Each song eases into the next in an effortless flow. The Dew is as others have said pretty damned amazing. Stream away, you wont be disappointed by this top notch show.",

      "review_text": "Excellent show, varying moments in sound quality This show is obviously one of the top shows of 1981. A lot of great shows this year. Uptown shows in February, whole east coast run in May, then, this mini tour culminating into an (imho) awesome European run in the fall. \n\nThis show is setlist wise and playing attention wise a very solid listen throughout. Jerry especially is focused and playing variations of what the normal \"motions\" could have been. We here as solid of lead guitar work as anything great in these early Brent years. \n\nHighlights include an incredible LLRAIN, BEW, Let It Grow>Don't Ease, and really the entire second set. Not a dull moment or screw up in the whole show though.\n\nFOREWARNING:\nShakedown>CC Rider, and Drums segment are an AUD source. They don't sound bad, but still slightly degrade what could be a perfect 5 star show. Also, we have what sound like level drop outs in Let it Grow and Don't Ease. The volume will lessen then suddenly shoot back up. I'm sure that Charlie did all he could with these inherent flaws in the masters. \n\nThere is also a nasty cut in what could be the best GDTRFB of 1981. A long intro jam that has roughly twenty seconds missing. Still a very inspired and unique rendition in an usual pre-drums slot. \n\nSo... overall\n5 star show (obviously)\n3 star sound quality (when its great, its great, but some flaws)\nSOLID 4 star rating!",

Jerry's lead break here is absolutely incendiary.

      "review_text": "This is pretty good This is pretty good for an 80's show. My dog liked it. Except for 'Looks Like Rain', he hates that song and so do I. This is an f'd up version anyway. Jerry uses his envelope filter on the intro to 'On the Road Again' and I think it sounds cool. I don't think he uses it again in the rest of the song but he should have. Jer Bear seems to be having a decent night. 'Ramble' and the ole 'Brown Eye' sung and played with conviction with tasty guitar solos. I really like Brent's organ fills in the parts of 'Playin' where Bob isn't singing. Does anybody else out there just skip over the singing parts straight to the jam? I do most of the time. Even post Donna. I just don't have the patience to sit through that shit to get to the good stuff. My bad. A lot of 80's Playin' jams sound exactly the same and this is no exception but it's still good for some reason(probably because it segues into an awesome 'Bertha')(Right now I'm eating a Kashi mushroom trio and spinach pizza and it is very flavorful)(I'm not a vegetarian though because I like hamburgers too much). And bacon. It's 81 and Jeresus can still rip it up just listen to the Buddy Holly song into 'Morning Dew.' Do you know what this song is about? Jerry's guitar will tell you at the end if you don't. It doesn't matter anyway.",

      "review_text": "Long Awaited Dew I know many of you were there. So was I.\n\n I was seeing a lot of shows then. We were waiting all year through for Morning Dew since Rochester back on 9/2/80. Through Radio City shows, 7 shows in March, 14 in May.. Then a trip to Minnesota and Alpine Valley in July which was not without it's own charms on 7/10/81 to say the least.\n\nI'd heard through the grapevine that they'd done a series of Dews 'out west' in the Summer. News was sketchy then, but those of us 'touring' to this degree knew we'd be catching a Morning Dew on one of these three shows when the Dead hit the East Coast in September. I felt since only 'everybody' was hitting Buffalo on the Saturday night coupled with The Dead's 'thing' for Upstate New York, this meant we'd get the Dew in Buffalo. And so it was.\n\nAnd what a show. Coming off the heels of a scorcher the previous night in Lehigh the boys rise to the occasion.\n\nThe first set is no match for the previous night's fireworks, but has some great moments, especially the beginning and end.\n\nthe second set, however, unleashes some energy that is serious. The pre-drums, OMG!\n\nThe Bertha packs a punch that not only matches but exceeds GDTRFB, which is at it's 80-81 best.\nSo that is high praise indeed. The same for Estimated which packs serious punch. The Playin crackles with energy.\n\nA friend who attended one show per tour noted afterwards that they reverse NFA > GDTRFB in favor for GDTRFB > NFA, albeit with drums > Space in between. I never would've thought of that.\n\nThe Morning Dew we'd waited on the East Coast for nine months (and I waited through 31 shows personally in that time) was so beautiful.. So touching in terms of Jerry's voice and guitar work. Certainly not a build-up monster like Rochester or the previous one in Berkeley on 9/11/81, but swiftly building up in intensity anyhow.\n\nAs I was at just about every great show that year except the summer ones out West and New Year's, here's how I'd rate the truly great ones I saw:\n\n1. 9/26/81\n2. 7/10/81\n3. 3/10/81\n4. 5/6/81\n5. 12/5/81\n\nThe only others I've heard from the whole year as good as those 5 are: 9/11/81, 9/12/81 & 12/31/81, 3/28/81 & 10/16/81.\n\nSo I guess that's my top ten of the year.",
