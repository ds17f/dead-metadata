Bob tries to steer the band into Watchtower about 5 times but the band just won't let him go there.  I would say this is some of the most psychadelic, intense, chaotic white noise the band pulled off in the nineties.  Maybe even as far back as the Playin' jam from Laguna Seca 88.  Cue this track up, play it LOUD, then tell your punk kid who thinks he knows what cutting edge is who you are listening to!",

Very good Peggy-0, killer Stagger Lee, and a nice long spacey Music complete with the midi solo.  \nThe second set was a monster, very Psychadelic.  I have had this second set, sans first set, on sBD since before Jerry died.  Don't know where the first set is.  Maybe copyright issues?  \n  Just before the Scarlet, Phil tuned in Fire on the mountain.  This could easily have been Victim>Fire.  I don't like Samba but this summer it was a nice break from way to go home.  So we were ok with that.  Could be one of the longest jammed out sambas, maybe soldier 7-23-94 might be longer, if that means anything.  The estimated maybe should have gone into eyes or something, maybe dark star?  But I enjoyed the exploratory nature of the estimated into drums. Lots of weirdness and Lsd at this show.  You could tell the energy dripped into the jams. Watchtower was awesome, and Bob did try starting this one more than once.  The band didn't want to let up.  They were all using sound effects.  The Stella was good but the previous writers were correct, 3-21-94 stella blue at Richfield was better., Way better.  It seemed like Jerry was trying to eclipse 3-21, because at this time, these were the only two times he reprised the stella blue verse over and over again to this length. Afterward, He never reached this height again with the song, but I guess I haven't heard every one after.  Satisfaction seemed like an encore.  And Liberty a second encore.  The sbd is awesome.  First summer with Cutler doing sound. Drums awesome. what can I say? I signed the Birthday card for Jerry and went in! Where is the first set?!",

Oh how I missed the days of Dan Healey (check out an aud copy of 3/23/92 to see what I mean...he filled The Palace with sound that night, instead of being afraid of sound like Cutler is. Listening to this show was like listening to it with pillows over both ears.

As others have noted, this Stella Blue, on this date in 1994, was something special.
