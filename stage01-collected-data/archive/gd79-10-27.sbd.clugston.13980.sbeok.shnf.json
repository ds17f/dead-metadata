The second set was very primal, the crowd on the floor was sloshing back and forth, pushing you three or four feet each way, even through He's Gone. The Other One made me think I was in the Avalon Ballroom or something, very fresh, very alive. This is the most intense show I ever saw. It converted me for life.",

The whole set is down right perfect. Sound quality is great, setlist is sick, and the tightness and straight up ass kickin these guys were in to that night is unmistakable. I was not even 1 years old at the time....but i would have to say that this show goes down as one of my all time favs to listen to....right behind those '77's and 90's.\nDefinately dl this one...if not or the Dancin>franklins, then for the BEST NFA EVER!!!!",

Having been there, I must say that I prefer the AUD version but both will get significant play time as they're both very good quality.  The venue was a typical third rate, minimalist, New England hockey arena - all metal.  I saw The Clash there the following Summer and condensation from body-heat was dripping back onto the crowd from the ceiling!  A true sweat-box.  I don't remember it being that bad for this show though (October after all).  \n\nThis being my introduction to the Dead, I was only familiar with 1 or 2 of the songs played this night.  Needless to say, this was the first of many real good times.",

      "review_text": "Glory Daze! Oh Boy - What A time we had traveling down to the CCC that beautiful fall of 79. The excitement we had in my small old Celica was almost as high as the Acapulco Gold of the time - sweet stuff. I had never experienced an open floor prior to this show and what a difference it was - we danced and swayed through the whole show - truly unique. The parking lot was a blast - no security - and we had quite a time all hanging out with the other Deadheads. It felt like we had our own place where no one bothered us and the fraternity feeling\nwas so predominate that to this day it is burned in my memory as my favorite experience at a show (with Lewiston a close second). \n  The building left much to be desired itself - its now a wharehouse - I couldn't belive how much the place heated up at that time of the year. I do remember that when we left the arena the steam poured out of the doors for a half hour to the heavens, sort of a tribute to intensity of the evening. I wished they played there more than just twice as the remoteness led to a purity of true fans dominating the scene. Peace and love were certainly the dominant themes in those days and at South Yarmouth it was like an epiphany of sorts - mostly of course due to Jerry and his band of traveling merrymakers. \n The show opens with a rockin Jack Straw which got the crowd into a frenzy of dedicated energy that lasted the whole night. The setlist is solid - but mostly its Jerrys pure vocals and sweet guitar that carried the pace.I recall the NFA as being\none of the highlights of the show - pure and tight \nstraight thru. The next night we banged on the seats after the encore and did our own unscripted version of NFA for quite a while - it was one of those great memories that stay with me - and man were we loud!\n  The Second set opened with a Dancin/Franklins/He's Gone masterpiece that is about as good as it gets for the Devotees - I love the thought of all of us dancing on the open floor to that great version of what to me is the nirvanna of Rock  - a three pack for the Ages!\nSomeone mentioned that this show's 25th anniversary was the same night that the Sox finally won the Series - well we danced in the streets once again - leave it up to Jerry to somehow link all of this together and give us all a little wink from his lofty perch - he still touches us to this day. \n I must say that this site has been a life changing experience in that I continually stream shows from my archives when I'm home - Thanks to all who contribute - the open sharing policy has allowed fans who were not lucky enough to be at shows to share in the aura that existed when the world was a kinder and gentler place.\nPeace - Smitty.",

I was a college student in California and I was dancing so hard, I caused my recording to go back and forth between stereo and mono.  Normally, I would sit back and listen to the hour on my headphones (at the time the GDH in my area came on at midnight on Sunday night) so as not to disturb anyone.  During the transition between Dancin & Franklins, I couldn't sit still!!!  I was dancing so much in my room that I interfered with the signal reaching my stereo system.  For years, this remained my lone copy.  I challenge ANYONE to listen the the Dancin->Franklin's without grooving along.  This is what makes you a Deadhead - the inability to control ones feelings while listening to amazing jams.  Listen and smile (and crack up on the lyric flub during He's Gone)\n\nPS - As a current resident of Cape Cod (pronounced \"Cawd\"), I have to report that the old Cape Cod Coliseum is now a warehouse for the \"Christmas Tree Shops\".  The company slogan is, \"Everyone Loves a Bargain.\"  How true - this show is available for free - how better of a bargain is that?",

Actually it was more like a hillbilly full brim hat.  Kinda cool.  So I put it on thinking that whoever dropped it would find it on my head easier than on the floor.  Sitting on the floor between sets this guy practically mugged me when he found me wearing his hat.  He was sooo happy and he was with a lot of other people who were equally as happy.  As it turned out he had about 2 years worth of set lists written on the inside of the hat.

      "review_text": "Dancin' with crickets and grasshoppers... - That Jam with Brent and Jerry is and I'll say it for the \"first time\" about any song or jam this is the best version of Dancin>Franklins. I can narrow dn and make top  10's or 5's but unless you heard every version and have them memorized its pretty hard to say this is the very best. I started trading tapes in 1987 and when I got this one I loved it, with Brent & Jerry going off on that funky shit. My friend was having a big party, parents on va-ca and very timely for us we just got back from a 4-night camping run at Alpine in 1988(first shows my Gosh) after He and I got back successfully with 2-different (10-lots) 2000 hits, Yikes...crazy when I look back and think how stupid it was, but I was lucky and loved every second of it. If I remember correctly they were fresh unicorns & lucky charms and very strong. We dosed the whole town heavy, so hard that my friends and I were calling it \"The Summer of Love 1988\".   \nNo shortage in MY town I was the man at the time. jk:) \n The kind of funny part to this story was I remember selling some sheets and dispersing hits it out in his bedroom and about an hour later everyone was so dosed grooving to some Pink Floyd and Zepplin, then I pull out this Tape Cape 79' nice clear sbd and cue Dancin>Franklins and we all took off on a pschedelic journey kind of square dancing fun as hell around a huge bon-fire in my buddy's back yard lots of love and hugs dancin and smiling...those were the days until Alpine 89. \n Anyway there were some kids coming up to me and sayin' bro whats up with that grass-hopper or cricket sound in that jam, what is this??Thats Funky, it has a George Clinton Parliment sound to it right? The whole party in the back yard was in awe and lovin it, the vibe was so perfect I was so stoked-hot chics, cool Bro's good clean and some killer Dead that no one had heard yet.\n  I liked that sound alot, hence bringig that tape to the party out of 100's and started to collect more tapes around that period to get more of it. Its most prevalent mainly Oct-Dec. 79' and really only 2-songs Dancin and Shakedown St.  \n If you zero in on some of the Shakedown's from this 3-mo. period you'll find Brent grindin' away. I wonder what that sound He used was technical called.\n Maybe its just a sound effect in his B3 very it's way old school hard-core to say the least. One thing is for sure its not Grasshoppers & Crickects.",

      "review_text": "This is a perfect example of why we kept going back for more and more............ The first two tunes of the 2nd set felt as if the \"Music played the band\" on that beautiful evening on Cape Cod.  The boys layed down a groove in \"Dancin'\" that set the stage perfectly for the unexpected sublime transition that opened the Heavens for \"Franklin's Tower.\" I have never had anything sneak up and grab me by my heart, mind and soul as when Jerry started singing, \"In another time's forgotten space....\"  \"Somehow\" between the combination of the hand-off out of \"Dancin',\" Jerry's other-worldly voice at that moment and the transcendant jams after every verse, I felt as if the coliseum was transformed into \"another time's forgotten space.\" Jerry's jams after every verse were never rushed with each one being a complete entity unto itself while simultaneously preparing the audience for the climatic final jam that had Jerry and Weir playing as One breaking through the wall and arriving \"Home\" for all to enter.  Just listen to those last two or three jams in \"Franklin's\" --- the Master and his student rising to the Heaven's together -- it was truly a blessing to hear and experience this moment in Paradise.\n    Really, if you haven't heard the Dancin'>Franklin's please, please do yourself a favor and listen to it....or at least listen from the hand-off out of \"Dancin'\" through the end of \"Franklin's\" -- this is an example of one of those tunes that you will play over and over again and again and again....5-stars for this experience alone.",

      "review_text": "Morphing transitions A so-so first set, but the second set has some great (and unusual)  transitions: that is, the regions where the Band is between songs. Some of the best Dead transitions are those where you can't pinpoint the spot where one song ends and the next begins.  The Dancing->Franklin's does this, and is excellent, as others have commented. (The Franklin itself goes on too long, as Jerry runs out of ideas.) Also good, and even more unusual, is the He's Gone->Other One transition. I believe the description here is wrong: there is no Caution jam here. But it's a very interesting jam with several phases. The Other One is also tasty.",

      "review_text": "WOW!!! There is some otherworldly shit going on here!! this is what the boys were all about, a half a year after Brent joined the band and they were already in peak form. 1979 was a magical year for the boys. Brent had not yet learned a lot of songs...(Jerry said in an interview before the Nassau run that they knew about 3 shows worth of songs) but the whole band had gelled very nicely and there was an energy to this fall that surpassed anything from the subsequent years. \n These Cape Cod shows were magical, the energy was just incredible, the place was a bandbox, and was very hot inside. The first set is very good and well played but they were saving their best for later. This second set is the best I ever saw in over 230 shows. If there is a better set out there I have yet to hear it. The Dancin > Franklins (over 30 minutes)  and He's Gone > Other One about 27 minutes (with an awesome Caution Jam in between)is some of the most powerful jammin I saw the boys do. Phil totally drives thie set. there are 2 times in the Dancin>Franklin's that he just steps up and sterrs the Jam to new frontiers. At the end of Franklins, as it appears that jer and the rest of the band are wrapping the song up, he comes in with some loud powerful licks that totally re-energizes the boys to pick it right up and go for about 3 minutes more...awesome!!! The Drums until the end is almost never mentioned in this show, but while the post drums songlist is fairly routine, it does not get treated that way. The NFA is one of those late 70's slow versions with no intro licks, just great drawn out jammin and Jerry really pouring everything into his voice and guitar. The Black Peter is one of the most powerful and emotional versions I have heard, again Phil has some sweet and timely licks throughout, and the Round & Round is done in the old style, with a great fast Chuck Berryesque jam at the end. Phil is awesome for the whole show and drives the whole second set to greater heights, Brent jams throughout, Jerry is at his best and the rest of the boys are in top form throughout. The sound is excellent... A must for any collection",

      "review_text": "This Show Smokes!! This is a KILLER show!!\n\nI don\u2019t know what it is about these Fall/Winter shows from 1979, but I definitely keep coming back to them.  Maybe with the release of \u201cRoad Trips Vol. I\u201d, it\u2019s like awakening a sleeping giant (as in Garcia).  LOL\n\nThis first set rocks!  It\u2019s not your typical first set, but every song is played with incredible energy and precision.  Any time a show starts with Jack Straw, you know you are in for a treat.  It\u2019s easy to see how Garcia came from country, folk, and blue grass roots with the way he plays guitar in Me and My Uncle and Big River!  That\u2019s just classic boogie music at its best!  And if you want to know how Garcia and Mydland developed such incredible chemistry, all\u2019s you have to do is listen to this version of Brown Eyed Women.  The guitar and keyboards are totally in sync!  Stagger Lee is super mellow and Bob Weir\u2019s rhythm guitar and incredible vocals are easily displayed on Lost Sailor > Saint of Circumstance > while ending the set with a kick-ass version of Deal (Garcia\u2019s trademark).  I love that song!\n\nWhen Garcia released his first solo record in 1972, Deal was certainly the centerpiece of that album!  If you don\u2019t own \u201cAll Good Things\u201d (the 6-CD box set from Jerry Garcia), go to his website and buy it!  It\u2019s awesome.  It has his 5 studio CDs, plus 4 hours of previously unreleased studio music.  On the 1972 solo record, Garcia handled the vocals as well as acoustic guitar, electric guitar, pedal steel guitar, bass, piano and organ duties. The album was co-written by Grateful Dead percussionist Bill Kreutzmann (who plays drums on the record) and longtime Grateful Dead/Garcia lyricist Robert Hunter. The remastered edition of Garcia features the album's original ten songs plus eight bonus tracks, including alternate takes of \"Sugaree\" and \"Loser.\"  Anyone who doesn\u2019t have Garcia as their top 5 guitarists need to have their head examined!  Plus his vocals have truly been missed since his death in 1995.\n\nSet 2 from this show is as good as Set 1.  I\u2019m not a huge Dancin\u2019 fan, but I really like this version.  Brent\u2019s vocals on this song are better than Donna\u2019s versions (except maybe from the \u201977 shows (like the Philly Spectrum on 4-22, Palladium, NY on 5-4, and Barton Hall, Cornell Univ. on 5-8).  The transition into Franklin is off-the-hook!  And what can you say about a 21-minute Frankin\u2019s Tower?  May be one of the best of all time!!  Any time you have He\u2019s Gone (an incredible 13+ minutes) before the boys propel you into The Other One > Drums > NFA > and then into Black Peter, you have the foundation for one great show!\n\nAnd check out the next night at Cape Cod!  I agree with Purple Gel\u2026it\u2019s just as good as the first night!  He\u2019s seen them over 230 times, so pay attention to his reviews.  He knows what the hell is talking about!  If he says the 2nd set is the best he ever saw in over 230 shows, then obviously he knows what the hell he is talking about!  I would have given anything to be at both shows on 5-27 and 5-28, being wasted and having an incredible time in that coliseum where the atmosphere was electric, hot, and jammin\u2019!\n\nAnd any show that is remastered by Charlie Miller \u2013 download it!  They are easily the best sounding boards out there!\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",

I am not sure why I never heard anything about this year.  I started going to shows in 84, and getting tapes around that time and never really heard too much from '79, I guess it may have been considered a transition year, but not for me.  Each of the '79 tours had huge highlights, especially the entire fall tour throughout the winter and NYE.\n\nAll of the Dancin'>Franklin's from '79 were terrific (most-notably the Buffalo blowout ver.).  This song combo really is another best kept secret.  There is no doubt this combo could(sh) have become a mainstay for years to come.  I could have handled a lot more ot that funky synth sound.  This show features great song tempo's and the selections are great thoughout.  I really love the opening sequence of Jack Straw and Candyman.  I was skeptical, initially of the Caution jam, but it definitely does not dissapoint, get's way out there, and is wildly intense leading up to a massive Phil bomb-infused Other One.  Also, this is probably my favorite all-time Stagger Lee, and one of the best Black Peter's around.\n\nSomeone had posted on another website that this could be the best Dead show ever - it is absolutely up there.  It is at least deserving of some type of discussions (just apparently quietly).  Come on, let the '79 secret be known.",

It was a great show, playing wise but the song selection has been much better. I saw 200+ shows, but we just don't agree. However, some of the best played shows I saw were not the best song-wise and maybe thats what he is saying. I think the Radio City shows were some of the best I saw, but again the song selection at those shows was repetative (even the acoustic sets-after hearing a few).",

      "review_text": "Lost weekend in Cape Cod What a trip of a weekend...Drove up from NYC with my buddies and met the band pulling into the Best Western. Somehow got in and hung out with them in a separate building of rooms next to the main hotel. I remember carrying some of their gear into the show and then having a stellar weekend in that old venue. Those were the days when you could just hang around and the band was cool with it. This show will be on the new monster boxed set for 1979. Very cool!",

      "review_text": "79-85 Good years! The Brent era going through to 85 is sooo underrated imo. This show has been a fav since I got the (tape) in 81' just epic Grateful Dead. Then we get 80-82 LOT's of jem's there too but fall 83'! and lot's of 84' the boy's were ALL on fire. But I digress this show is just special. Glad I'm not the only one who agrees Lol as it seems everyone thinks 77 was the zenith of the boy's, and I do like 77 so don't get me wrong but I'd rather listen to 1970-1972 then 1977 anytime of the week. Just prefer the sound.",

I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. Also the Jack Straw. Over the years, whenever they would open with it, I would get a chill, all my hair would stand up in anticipation. My old friend DB, who used to have a similar reaction, and I, named it the \"Jack Straw Rush\". Early '80s Rocked!",

      "review_text": "Image is flipped for a while but quality is high The first board tape section (between splices) is backwards. The stereo image is wrong. This is a common occurrence with transfers from tape to digital. To hear what the front of house engineer was doing you need to wear your headphones on the wrong ears until after the first splice. Second set is correct. Brent should be on the right and Bobby on the left. Same with Mickey and Billy, respectively. Just sayin if you wanna stay in context flip your headphones until after the splice. \n\nOutside of that this is an excellent soundboard tape. It\u2019s so clear you can hear the audience go up in level when the band steps on their microphone gates (black mat triggers). I have come to know when they\u2019re about to sing because they step up and the vocal mics turn on and the audience gets louder! This isn\u2019t a quality you get from most archived shows. This is one of the better shows on archive. ",
