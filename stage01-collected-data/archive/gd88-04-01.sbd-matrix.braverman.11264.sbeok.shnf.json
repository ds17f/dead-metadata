I was ecstatic to find this posted and find that its the same exact recording with the amazing mix someone mentioned before.  This wasn't the strongest or most varied on setlist grounds at all, but was my favorite show of the three because of the vibe that was just so there and translates so well onto the tape.\n\nOther reviewers have lauded set one and I agree that set one is terrific; but set two just takes off, in my mind - the China>Rider is flawlessly executed, as is the Estimated, which melts gorgeouly into a very dreamy Eyes, one of my favorites of its style before the big bass drums of 89-90 years (which were also awesome but laid down a completely different feel, if you get my drift) took over and drove the song to a completely different place.  The Wharf Rat>Throwin>NFA is also just flawless.  It was as if they couldn't play a wrong note if they tried.  Just a thing of beausty and among my 3 or 4 favorite shows I attended.",

I was at this show, and I knew, dancing to Deal, that it was one of the best hands ever dealt- Royal Flush in my book, especially at the 5 minute mark through around 5:35.\n\nThe Other one is like a continuation of space all throughout the song. Listen to it...it is mind blowing and trippy, with hallucinogenic vocal effects and the like.\n\nDownload this now",

      "review_text": "It's Getting Better All the Time 1st Set: Apparently, Jerry hasn't left the stage since last night as he's simply magical during the last few minutes of \"Mississippi.\" NYC is held in high regard as Bobby counters with the beloved \"Jack.\" The verses are rather rushed, and the climax isn't as powerful as previous reviews have hinted. It's always a treat to grab my fondest, and sing-along to the romance of \"To Lay me Down.\" Oh my, is this the first ever \"Ballad of a Thin Man,\" and I think it succeeds quite nicely without building to any crescendo. Tonally, \"Push\" is a good call though Bobby's guitar is annoyingly clanging more than usual. Now it's time to grab that little lady and get dirty, \"Minglewood.\" Bobby enthusiastically sings away and the energy's solid throughout. I ain't complainin that they're headed for \"Cumberland\" territory. Wow, that got nice and toasty...I'd be sweatin a storm by now. Wowsers, and the heat only continues to build as this is one of the finest \"Deal's\" I've ever heard. YES!! Everyone's connecting on all cylinders. Bobby: \"Back in just ever so little bit.\" \n\n2nd Set: We're always stepping with the right foot with a pokey, exemplary played \"China.\" The jam is quite involving. \"Rider\" is sturdy and resilient. Immediately upon its arrival, everyone digs the \"Estimated\" as the evening's next selection. It's manna; providing me a bountiful amount of smiles. It's evident that Jerry and thereby the rest of the band is becoming increasingly confident in reestablishing themselves as a 'jam' band. In '87 a combined \"Estimated/Eyes\" would not have gone over 17 minutes; these two versions are twenty one minutes plus. \"Eyes\" smoothly runs into \"Drums.\" Bobby's clumsily slaying a fawn while Jerry and Brent's alchemy transforms it into something all together different. After \"Space\" things remain in the inferno; there are moments in \"TOO\" when the danger feels painstakingly real (5:20) Someone's voice sounds a bit sour though it's an admirable effort \"Wharf.\" I'm not a fan of when Bobby adds too much decadent 'rock star' to a politically charged tune like \"Throwing,\" but this version's decent anyways. \"NFA\" is brief and does a complete stop, but manages to shake me timbres. \n\nThe obvious \"Breakdown\" closes out a strong three night stand in the Jersey swamplands. \n\n3 4/5 stars",

      "review_text": "first show This was my first show.  it was very hard to get in.  i was lucky to scalp a ticket.  the scene looking back at that night was very busy especially for my 17 year old ass that just got his license 2 weeks prior and a bag of goodies an hour before. \nthis show is a perfect example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  very tight and very high energy.  it has that locomotive feel to it....just about to fall off the tracks quicksilver slipperiness to it.  7/15/04 has the locomotive feel to it but on a mellower scale.  the minglewood, cumberland, deal trio is a testament to that high energy and seems unique to this show..at least in feel.  the second set is just so perfect.  i think that this is what JG was referring to as when his playing is sp effortlessly easy that it might seem boring.  although i dont find it boring.  that little waterfall intro into Eyes is so pretty.  I have never heard anyone play so pretty like Jerry.  The sound is a bit tinny for me but will never disctract or be a deterrent to listening.  Jerry's singing is very innocent sounding...like when phil listened to the AB recordings from 1970 and says how innocent Jerry sounded...1987 & 1988 show that same innocence (for lack of a better word).  I listened to this show about a month after JG died on the way to work.  it was a gorgeous sunny crisp North Carolina morning and i listened to the 1/2 Step.  Hearing JG tear into that solo out of 1/2 Step just killed me....the sun, the solo, and the final acceptance that it was over and never would come back.  Very emotional experience.  \nGreat show that i will always remember.",

I never heard Jerry sing so clearly or play so energetically at a live performance. 18 years after seeing this show, I have not recovered from the effects of the jam at the end of Deal. My life was altered by the music I heard at this concert; it's that simple. You owe it to yourself to have a listen.",
