I've listened to so many many Dark Stars, and I always come back to this one as the finest when I want to relax and get carried away from the everyday - it's super psychy, yet a bit mellow, spacey, intense... ..VISUAL!  kind of melancholy at first, but builds to one of the most emotive DS of all... Jimi died just two days before this - [it was only back on the 69-70 New Year's that some of the greatest recordings of ALL TIME were made...not just the Dead's show, but just listen again to Band of Gypsys do 'Machine Gun' live]\n tonight Jerry's CRUISIN!  Bobby's rhythm playing will drop your jaw... (great sample at about 19:40)... the boys just tumble over one another like little kids swimming in the sky and then come back together and parachute down... this one will tickle your brain and leave you in a much better place when you land 25 mins and 24 secs later...WOW!",

This Dark Star has already received heaps of praise here yet I am absolutely compelled to add some of my own. \nI put this on with a fresh ear, having never before  given this show a listen late last night... In those long dark lonely hours when sleep won't come, when a person needs something to salve the soul, to inspire them to push on hard and steady, some chose random Bible verses, and I chose random shows. Last night I required something extra to give me that inspirational push, to uplift my spirit and shake my soul back to life and so I went in search of a primo Dark Star. It was something that I needed to be just right. I put my faith in my decision to give this one a try. I selected it based on the year and the venue as my lifelong favorite has always been 2/13/70( as the years, hell the decades have passed  I have learned that labels such as best ever or favorite are not really easily applied to things outside of the moment the 2/13 is my gold standard so to speak. \nI found what I needed of course, I usually do which is why I still keep coming back. \nI lay in bed with my earbuds in. I press play close my eyes and the opening notes begin. I am in that room at the Fillmore East and it's 1970. Nine years before I would be born, but I am there, I am in the crowd feel a part of, no fel at one with the energy in the room. I can see the band on stage younger than I am now. And that's all thanks to whomever it was who knew how important it truly was to preserve this moment in time. This recording is utterly beautiful, transportive. Mickey hypnotizes me with whatever it is that he plays that sounds like a creaking or winding noise. I really don't know what specifically it's called but it was used in the same part during the 2/13 Star, and I always Invision him.playing it hunched over intently focused one with this tiny little instrument trying to summon the rythem of the universal energy current which when he succeeds here is what first brings us up into the higher levels of the atmosphere and then we move on beyond into space where all illusion falls away and what we are left with is one eternal moment of introspection and truth, the highest peak of self knowledge because here we are beyond and removed from the world and the things which are in it. They have all fallen away. We are purified here in these silences briefly yet deeply and then we begin to explore what is beyond the darkness the heavens of the heavens. \n  What more is really needed to be said about a work of art then that it can drive darkness from the soul ? This Star does that it can do that if you allow it to do so.",

      "review_text": "The geometry of it <br />This show is known for the Dark Star, a funny Lovelight, and the final Pig version of Good Morning, School Girl.  We have 3 overlapping sections covering this show: an incomplete SBD of the second half of the second set, and two partial AUDs - one poor qual and one so bad that it stopped circulating. The date, however, is known for being the day that news broke of the death of Hendrix. Reports were still confirming the news stateside. This day was also the start of the US Led Zep tour, with two shows further uptown, at MSG. In that afternoon show Plant is heard breaking the news, right before What Is and What Should Never Be [btw one of Zep's best U.S. appearances]. Rock was still a public menace to the mainstream, and newspapers were thin on coverage (pg 29 of that day's NY Times - don't forget, this was still when cops/rednecks would wait outside concerts to bust the heads of \"hippies\"). Notwithstanding overall show quality, the band is intensely forthright, becoming so blown out that they can't do an encore. Some sources have the final remarks, with Phil & Pigpen explaining why the show is over. This is the peak bacchanalia of the rock temple/experiment/generational carnival that briefly glowed at the Fill E. \n\nFirst Set. Not including the rare AUD (mono condenser mic/portable cassette recording of mostly AUD noise), we have almost 2hrs of tape, with the Weinberg AUD portion starting with the last two songs of the 1st set. These are the final versions of <i>Jordan</i> (there's no \"Cold\" in the title) and <i>Swing Low Sweet Chariot</i>, with the '70 tour format ending.\n\nSecond Set. The AUD on <i>Morning Dew</i> focuses on some guy ejecting people from his row. These portions of the show may have been good, but it sounds like it was taped from the lobby. We only have three examples of <i>Good Morning, School Girl</i> from '70. This is the last one, and the final Pigpen version (the next is 17yrs later). The SBD begins at the end of <i>Sugar Magnolia</i>. Luckily we have the wonderful DS>St. Stephen>NFA in pristine qual. The <i>Dawk Staw</i> starts like the usual '70. With prominent Pig guiro, the themes touched upon will be familiar to '70 DS fans, but what unspools becomes more contemplative and unique. They wind down to a stop after 8mins, and slowly wind back up the beanstalk. Bobby starts a Feelin' Groovy Jam @16:07.  <i>St. Stephen</i> is great. You get all the little extras, including Mickey's cannon @4:04. Bobby is fantastic here. So far the generic '70 2nd set sequence perhaps, but <i>Not Fade Away</i> is not the usual. It takes off a few minutes in, and @5:10 Jer starts a Darkness, Darkness jam, then abruptly starts a China jam @6:13, but does so by playing Bobby's usual part! At one point they are playing the same China Cat lick at the same time, Bobby responding by modifying the riff, before they bump the transverse and scoot at supplementary angles. Fun stuff. Isn't this the only NFA with a Darkness? It's certainly the most complete China jam in an NFA. <i>Lovelight</i> is musically generic, but Pig is in a mood (a fuck mood) and it's a must-hear-once.  Pig goads the punters, holding the mic out, with one customer yelling \"alright let's ball in the moonlight\". Wtf? Bobby chides Pigpen for saying \"fuck\" - which was no small thing in '70, and granted some musicians a night in jail (maybe not in NYC). Jer starts a Let it Rock jam @13:50  and Mickey has his cannon reloaded for the end. Several times along the way the band prompts Pig to move along. Bobby screams himself hoarse and instead of \"and leave it on\", Pig yells \"fuck!\". He has driven the heads to a frenzy, enlivened by the atmosphere of the Fill E, often described as blissful. Up come the lights and house music, but the crowd is having none of it. Finally Phil comes out and explains that they are well tired, Jer has a cramping hand, and Bobby has lost his voice. Then Pig has to say fuck one more time.\n\nOverall = 3 stars (incl. both circulating show frags)\n\nHighlights:\nDark Star - guiro, feelin' groovy, wind down, and  contemplative \nSt. Stephen - all the extras\nNot Fade Away - darkness in China \n\nSOURCES: The reynolds_97906 is the most complete SBD, though still only half of the second set circulates. It has speed wobbles, but on average it <u>needs -1% pitch correction</u>, except for St. Stephen, which <u>needs -2%</u>. Most SBDs frustratingly cut up the NFA jams (or more) into separate tracks. Lovelight sounds crisper on buller_102, but it fades out before the final remarks, has the channels switched, and has several dropouts throughout. The warner_25473 is the Weinberg AUD, the most that circulates. It has wide speed variations and <u>needs +1%</u> except for Sugar Mag, which <u>needs -2.5%</u>, and Cold Rain & Easy Wind, which are pitched correctly. However Morning Dew and M&MU are better on the akg_weinberg_moore-berger version, which has different speed fluctuations, the first <u>needing +3.5% pitch correction</u>, and the latter <u>needing +2.5%</u>. The chappell_SB14_31510 matrix combines the two with astonishing qual for '70 (albeit with the attendant variable pitch issues).",
