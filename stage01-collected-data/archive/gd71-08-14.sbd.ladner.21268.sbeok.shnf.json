With the show starting with a  Bertha, Uncle, Mr.Charlie, Sugaree lineup, it's  beginning to look, and sound like a Europe 72  show. And with a Brokedown, Loser, Hard to Handle  and Cumberland to follow -you're hooked! Even the  Playin is starting to get, well, jammy!\n \n Listening now to the Truckin>Other One>Jam. Wow.  the boys are in Berkeley and preaching to the  choir. They blast out of the gate like it's 1969,  then space it out to mellowville with Jerry  leading the way with sparkling jazzy non-wah  riffs. Do you hear the China Cat theme halfway  thru? Quickly morphs into a prototype MLB jam  before turning dark and modal again then  thundering back to the verse. Definitely \"burning  crater of my mind\" territory!\n Two discs of pure Dead Magic. Highly recommended.\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback ;-)\nPS - get the second night as well!",

      "review_text": "End of an era? What an amazing find these shows are (8-14 & 15 -71)!  It\u00c3\u00c2s hard to believe they somehow evaded me for so long.\n\nLike many, I\u00c3\u00c2ve had the audience tapes of the Hollywood 8-5/6 shows, and considered their absence from the Vault a big loss.  But we have these shows, which rest assured are of equal caliber.  In fact, if these four shows were all available in similar sound quality for comparison, I strongly suspect that people\u00c3\u00c2s opinion of the relative merits of the shows would change.\n\nYes, my two or three very favorite moments come from the Hollywood shows (specifically, moments in each of the Other One\u00c3\u00c2s), but overall, if my back was against the wall and I had to pick one show, I would probably give the nod to 8/14.\n\nThe high points from all four of these shows are undoubtedly the Other One jams.  It is no coincidence that the boys played it back-to-back in both runs.  In 1971, the Other One was THE signature jam of the band.  Though they\u00c3\u00c2d been jamming on it for fully four years, I find these 71 ones to be my favorite. Portchester 2-23, Fillmore 4-28, Fillmore West 7-2, which David Gans once described as \u00c3\u00c2molten\u00c3\u00c2 \u00c3\u00c2 they are all momentous musical events in the Dead\u00c3\u00c2s history. And the four from these runs belong center square in this group.  I\u00c3\u00c2m particularly partial to 8-5 (I love those blood-curdling yells from the audience in all the right places!), and the Me & My Uncle segueway part in 8-6 \u00c3\u00c2 but this is a review of Berkeley 8-14/15 \u00c3\u00c2 I digress. \n\nThese August 71 shows also have musical historical significance. They represent the last shows with solid body Gibson guitars (Jerry and Phil).  By the time of the Gaelic Park gig 8-26, Jerry had switched to a Strat and Phil was playing a hollow body.  Two months prior to a further thinning out of the band\u00c3\u00c2s guitars due to Keith joining, this was the last time we would here those big, fat Gibson tones emanating from Jerry\u00c3\u00c2s amps.  It\u00c3\u00c2s my opinion that Jerry\u00c3\u00c2s switching to a Strat\u00c3\u00c2as well as Keith\u00c3\u00c2s piano\u00c3\u00c2affected (adversely) Jerry\u00c3\u00c2s style in a feedback-loop sort of way. The thinner tones influenced Jerry to play with less vibrato and ballsiness, and play more scales.  This was exacerbated by the addition of Keith\u00c3\u00c2s percussive piano playing later that year.  Was the thinning of Jerry\u00c3\u00c2s sound evident at the Gaelic Park show just two weeks later?  I\u00c3\u00c2m not sure. You be the judge.  \n\nBack to the shows. The sound quality is exceptional.  There are some problems in the mix in places.  Overall, Phil\u00c3\u00c2s bass is out front in both channels.  Now, I\u00c3\u00c2d be the first to admit that there are a lot worse things than having Phil too loud.  On the two Other One jams we *really* get to hear Phil\u00c3\u00c2s brilliance crystal clear.\n\nJerry in parts is a little too far back in the mix.  But that\u00c3\u00c2s OK, too.  The biggest problem is that Bobby\u00c3\u00c2s guitar appears and disappears in the mix.  In fact, in the 8-14 Not Fade Away jam, it seems as if he disappears altogether!  This is a *real* shame, because this is a longer than usual NFA jam, and Jerry and Phil are kickin\u00c3\u00c2 ass. The absence of Weir\u00c3\u00c2s rhythmic glue is a real shame.\n\nBut that astride, and taken as a whole, these shows sounds GREAT!  They belong in every serious Dead Head\u00c3\u00c2s collection.  In fact I would say that the two shows belong in Dick\u00c3\u00c2s Picks. This is the real deal. The end of an era?",

      "review_text": "That BCT sound There is something unique about the way the shows from Berkeley Community Theater sound. Can't put my finger on it, but it's a good thing! This is an excellent show, and even though I prefer the 15th over this one, I wouldn't(didn't )hesitate to grab this too. Hard To Handle is definately one of the hotter versions out there, and Cumberland ain't bad either. I think they played some of their best shows with this original 5 man line-up in the post-Fillmore/pre-Keith era. A small sliver of time in a huge run. If you like 1971, you'll love this. 4 stars, because I gave the 15th 5.",

Hard To Handle and Cumberland Blues are among my favorite versions of those songs ever played. 8/06's Hard To Handle is also outstanding. I love the different treatment El Paso gets, much slower and close to the original than they would play it later, but it has a really nice power and feel to it. Seriously fine playing by all but Jerry and Phil really stick out. Man they were on this night. In fact all of August '71 is fantastic. '71 was such a crazy year from Mickeys' leaving and the raw swagger of the earlier part of the year to the addition of Keith in late Sept (I think). BTW I love the two keyboard sound of Pigpen and Keith. Well it seems by August they'd more than weathered Mickey's loss and the Dead were nothing less than outstanding!",

Europe '72 is known to have the best versions of <i>Mr. Charlie</i>, but this smokes. It's only the 6th one. The next couple are average, with a pre-solo-era <i>Sugaree</i> and Bobby out of tune, until the awesome <i>Big Railroad</i> (better even than 4/5 or 10/19). <i>Brokedown</i> isn't the dirge it became at times and <i>Playing</i> gets a straight reading \u2013 except for the animated Phil. The rest of the set is average '71.\n\nSecond Set. The first part of <i>Truckin'</i> is cut on all sources. The set starts pretty average (though the middle jam of <i>The Other One</i> has cool, non-Dead-like moments) until a whopping <i>Sugar Mag</i>; powerful, snarling, and not like most '71s. <i>NFA</i> is also approached differently this night, and by <i>GDtRFB</i> the machine is ON! The hot double encore has the best <i>UJB</i> of '71.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>:\u00a0 B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall =  4\u00bc Stars\n\nHighlights:\nBertha \u2013 oft-noted, OFF released\nMe & My Uncle \u2013 so many '71s are good, yet this stands out\nMr. Charlie \u2013 known more as a '72, but great here\nBig Railroad Blues \u2013 one of the better versions\nSugar Mag>NFA>Goin' Down the Road \u2013 not approached quite like most '71s\nJohnny B Goode \u2013  whole double encore flies\nUncle John's Band \u2013 best-ever candidate\n\nSOURCES: The ladner_21268 SBD sounds best, though all SBDs have fluctuating pitch issues and run fast. Bertha through Mr. Charlie, El Paso, Brokedown through Cumberland, Promised Land, the first part of TOO, and UJB <u>need -1.5% pitch correction</u>. Sugaree, the second part of TOO, and Sugar Mag through JBG <u>need -1.75%</u>. Big Railroad & Big Boss <u>need -2%</u>. Loser & Truckin' <u>need -1%</u>, and Bobby McGee <u>needs -1.25%</u>. Bertha is on the <b>Huckleberry Jam</b> LP. The show will likely become an OFF release.\n\nJasW \u2013 I caught the semitone descriptive error and came back to fix it (sticking to just the math), to see that you also caught it. Thanx for the help!\nDireWharf \u2013 Thanx for clarifying. \"Pitch\" is an analog term for motor speed (therefore pitch) on professional decks. In the digital realm the distinction is made between \"speed\" & \"pitch\" because you <i>can</i> change one without the other. I prefer to stick with the old-school term for the correction, called \"speed\" in Audacity and most modern software, assuming assume anyone interested in accurate playback (and knowing the errors were introduced in the analog chain) will figure it out.",

      "review_text": "- Very hard to rate this one below a 5 due to the presence of fat guitar tones never to be heard again at a Dead show and also blissful jams in the interesting parts of the concert. It's patchy, but what makes a 5 is something to do with love.\n\nBTW, I've really been enjoying Mind Wondrin's reviews. It's good to hear someone who knows some stuff expressing it for others' benefit. \n\nDitto on MW's endorsement of guitar tone talk: a very wine-tastey and synaesthetic form of sound-art criticism that I find fun.",

For years I  steadfastly held to the doctrine that Skull and Roses was the ultimate in the Phil Zone, but now the Internet Archive has showed me the error of my ways. I respectfully acknowledge that the entire month of August 1971 is the pinnacle of Phil's Phat EB3 glory (never to be heard again after the EB3 was stolen before the show at Gaelic Park?)",

      "review_text": "Pitch correction I'll just briefly note that Mind Wonderin' is a little off below on the pitch correction needed here. It's not a halftone (i.e., semitone) too fast. It's exactly a quarter of a semitone. In Change Pitch in Audacity, a Semitones setting of -0.25 yields a Percent Change of -1.434%. (For those wondering, I pulled out a loop of Pig playing an \"E\" during a tuning interlude, and this correction brought it in tune perfectly.) Take that -1.434% figure and plug it into Percent Change under Change Tempo in Audacity. Do not use Change Pitch -- while you will correct the pitch, remember that it won't decrease the slightly increased tempo that resulted from the too fast tape speed. \n\nAs for the show -- it's the summer of '71, what can I say? For me, this was their peak. 1971-08-06 Hollywood Palladium is a better show, but this one is no slouch, and is undeniably a worthy addition to a summer '71 playlist.",

      "review_text": "My first West Coast Dead show Major difference from east coast Dead shows I had seen up to that point. The park across from Berkeley High School before the doors opened was the early form of later years of what became Shakedown Street. There just weren\u2019t any vendors. I met Betty Cantor for my one and only time. She had a beautiful smile. Also met Phil. He was driving his BMW. \n The concert itself was amazing. Sat next to the aisle half way back from the stage. A chillum filled with Lebanese red hash was passed to me. A few tokes and I was in a blissful state of being. \n  These two nights (also 8/15/71) coincided with my first trip to the Bay Area to visit my sister living in Sausalito . After a few days in Marin County I hitchhiked up to Lane County, Oregon to visit my brother and his wife who were living in a tipi 30 miles southeast of Eugene. As I was 17 and between junior and senior years of high school back in Connecticut I made up my mind to move out to Oregon after graduation in the spring of 72. Soon after that 71 trip to Northern California and Western Oregon I saw the film version of Sometimes A Great Notion based on the great American novel by Ken Kesey. All these mentioned influences, Grateful Dead, Ken Kesey, the Pacific Northwest , the Mediterranean \u201clight\u201d of the Bay Area, the old hippie scene of Eugene, Oregon, tipis, my own end of innocence yet still viewing the Universe with fresh eyes and open heart still burn bright in my soul. Long live the music of the Grateful Dead!",
