I remember the boys being absolutely on this day yet i was completley exhausted and could even find the energy to dance. i remeber the msic just got better and better with each note yet i just couldnt keep going, :(  We went all the way up near the side of the stage in a quiet area that day , in front of us was a lady with a baby on her lap, during bird song a bird crapped on her leg, classic.  Anyways probably my favorite show ever from music to the scene GREAT SHOW",

Shirts were optional in the weather with lots of room to walk around and dance. Spinners and Gypsies were in full force at this show. The dead always played a little extra special at Autzen. The music was very solid and quite tight, particularly by GD standards. After the show it was every man for himself in finding a place to crash as the lots were emptied quick. No big tho, plenty of local hippie dead-heads were willing to share porches and spare rooms. Get this show and enjoy....peace, JB",

Compared to the 5 song first sets that people were subjected to in 1995, a six song first set still is lame, but at least they made up for it in the second set. Whereas in 95, they were crapping out 5 song first sets, then playing a second set that was three songs pre drums and two post drums. \n\nBetter than I remember it being in person, course I recall being pretty distracted by all the fun!!",

      "review_text": "Great Second Set!! I agree, I'm not sure why some are so critical of this show.  We all know the first sets were frequently throw-aways, so putting that aside, in the context of 94-95 shows, the second set is phenomenal.  A great ScarletFire followed by an upbeat Samson...ok, so no one likes Way to Go Home, but since we were either going to get that or Samba I'd opt for the former.  The Playin and Uncle Johns were very solid leading us into drums after ~65 minutes of excellent playing by the boys.  In post drums, can't complain about The Other One (even Vince is sounding good). The Wharf Rat is a little shorter than I would have liked, and Good Lovin is solid, but not particularly special.  Closing the show with a beautiful Knockin puts this as one of the last great shows the boys played.\n\nIs it top ten ever?  No, of course not, but comparing the band in 69 to the band in 74 to the band in 94 is ridiculous, the sounds were vastly different. So, in the context of mid-nineties shows, this is one of the best you will find.",

      "review_text": "One of the best of 1994 \"Spinners and gypsies\"- Completely agree, this crowd was as freaky and in synch as they came in the later years.\nA freewheeling atmosphere made this one of those shows that stand out vividly in my memory. I was way up front for the final night, where I had the pleasure of watching Jerry in decent condition and the band pushing things further than usual. \nFirst set peaked with a gorgeous Bird Song, but also features the rare \"Shoe Fits\" which I enjoyed the lyrics to.\n\nScarlet>Fire is drawn out nicely, with a distinct drummer-guided jam. The final minute or so of Fire ends with a particularly unique segment.\nPlayin initially doesn't go too deep, but the Uncle John's that follows is powerful and engaging. The rhythm section is really on top of things on this one. The post drums playing is equally solid and the Knocking encore is particularly heartfelt and deserves a listen\nI remember walking past a glum looking taper on the way out of this show. I had the nerve to ask him where his tape cut, and he just muttered \"Wharf Rat\"\n\n4.5 stars, because its a reminder that even near the end, they could still tap into that special place.",

I now have a terrific sounboard though.\n\nI love this show.  I wept during the Other One because I had really been upset by how lame the shows had been getting and here they were blowing my mind.  Out of nowhere! They really pulled it out for this one and made my night. What an amazing second set!",

So I guess I understand when Bush says we need to stay the course but why choose one where people die? I'd much rather go to a dead show. especially this one.",

I will never forget how much fun it was camping out across the street from the stadium and meeting all the beautiful people I met that weekend.\n There was a girl named Gee, with a long Greek last name that I can't remember, anyway, absolutely beautiful girl with jet black hair. We danced together during the show, I remember a dude standing next to us with a big meerschaum pipe packed full of the local niceties that seemed to go around for like half an hour.\n The best part of this show for me was the Scarlet>Fire, I just remember dancing my ass off, and it seemed everyone around me was doing the same. Everything was in sync at that moment in time, definitely one of the coolest moments in my life. \n It's nice to hear this great recording, I had only heard a shitty audience tape before. It brings back some really nice memories. I wish I knew where Gee was.... :)",

      "review_text": "newby This was my first show. I was 20 at the time. I was living in Hot Springs, Ar...had just lost my job, my roomates ran off with all my possessions, and soon after, my landlord evicted me...so it was a blessing that I met a band of folks heading to this show. I had nothing to lose anymore and talked them into letting me go with them. Looking back it was a classic experience. When we got to the lot we did not have the fee for parking so we drove past the gatekeeper..who chased us for about 15 minuted before giving up. I didnt get in the 1st or 2nd day, but got a miracle on my 3rd. What I havnt said is that I had never heard the Grateful Dead. I didnt know what all this was about..and as I took my seat in the back of the stadium..I looked around perplexed...and as the music started I saw the response of the crowd...the proud Grandma in front of me bringing her Grandson (10 years old) to his 1st show also...all hold hands and dance...the world just fell away...I understood and my life was changed forever. I just listened to this for the 1st time sincw June 19,1994 and I feel it all over again.",

There was no accessibility to show downloads or listening.. I recall posting to rec.music.gdead the fact that the second set was amazing. Then, as now, folks questioned and denigrated personal opinion. \n\nIn the ensuing years, I had multiple cassettes of this show consisting of partial SB and AUD sources with cuts and patches to work with the tech that we had available at the time. It's so great to hear the show in it's entirety the way it was actually played.\n\nAloha from Maui,\nnassau73",

      "review_text": "one of the great ones I think it's a fair case to make but regardless of superlatives, this show is, indeed the shit.  A playful, sparkling \"Touch of Grey\" kicks it off and it's as if the minimalistic filigrees and light, high notes Jerry is playing is how it always should have been and how the song was really supposed to sound like.  Starting with this tour and continuing for the rest of the year (and arguably, into the next year), Jerry, in particular, is all about the revision of the phrasing of his songs and/or extending their jams/endings (sometimes stubbornly, as the \"Althea\" from Seattle earlier in the week) and this night is no different.  There were many shows in '94 when I remember thinking \"damn.  That's how that song is supposed to go\" as I questioned the logic of the statement; how could the 300th version of 'Brown-Eyed Women\" be the definitive rendition.  This is one of those BEW's, actually.  Not the \"best\" since the date of this show is not 11/4/77 and the band is not The Jones Gang.  Nevertheless, it is sweet and gentle like that one but different. That 15 minute \"Bird Song\" is the harbinger of set 2 and its 23-minute \"Fire on the Mtn\", a harbinger of the next 13 months.  Unlike some of the challengingly meandering extended versions of this final period (at Buckeye 94, I thought the band was going to lose it if he kept playing those fifths over and over again with his slide), this lengthy \"Fire\" is free of wasted notes and is among some of the most dense music the band has ever played.  When they break into \"Playin' in the Band\" and then, (Jesus!) \"Uncle John's  Band\"...man, if you were there you must have thought you landed at that year's 11-1-85.  Like, why did this audience win the psychedelic lottery while a few nights ago they got a Way to Go into space?  The mysterious Grateful Dead.  After an oddly brief Other One\", the Wharf Rat is another herculean effort, a throwback to the early 80's with its vast but weightless elegance.  This show comes out of nowhere and is a definitive one.  Good old Grateful Dead.",
