You should know that this was one of the rare quadrophonic broadcast experiments of the day.  That means that two stations, KSAN and KQED each broadcast half of the show.  What you are getting here is only half of the mix.  An interesting take, but ultimately unsatisfyingly incomplete.  Download it to hear Weir and Lesh's vocals upfront.  Kind of like the Beatles' mid 60s albums (Revolver)with that weird, radical stereo mix.\nListen to the power and energy in this set.  The Airplane and Quicksilver were to follow so they had only an hour and change to get it all in.  (Or blow the other bands away)!!",

I still have it on LP by Mammary Presents, or Productions...you could only fit about 30 minutes on an LP, so I never heard the whole show until I found it on the Archive.\n\nI highly recommend adding this show to your 1970 GRATEFUL DEAD collection. This is a fantastic show, the GRATEFUL DEAD are in time, in tune, and incredible.\n\nThis is my favorite version of \"China Cat Sunflower\" into \"I Know You Rider\". Garcia's solo is magical, mystical, and mythological. The boys never performed it like this again...\n\n\"Sugar Magnolia\" is sweet. Garcia works his Wah-Wah pedal like a sorcerer. \n\nThis is my second favorite version of \"Sugar Magnolia\" next to the one with Duane Allman on April 26, 1971 at the Fillmore East, NYC. I downloaded that show off the IA when you could. Here's where you can't download it anymore:  \n\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1971-04-26.sbd.unknown.2214.shnf\n \nI love the \"sound\" of this show...KSAN did something right. Phil's sound is fat and funky.\n\nThis show was heavily bootlegged back in the day. In 1971 I remember the record shop next to the Fillmore East selling copies of this show on LP's for $15.\n\nWithout this show in your collection you cannot be taken seriously as an aficionado of the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nOne of the best versions of \"Good Lovin'\" I've ever heard. My favorite of all time.\n\nThank you Mr. Harvey Lubar, Mr. Tony Cortazo and D. Winters for all your hard work in improving the quality of the sound of this show and sharing it with all of us. Most of us wouldn't know you guys if you stood next to us, but we want you to know we are Grateful for your efforts. Thanks for keeping the music we love alive.\n\nHere's one way to download this show:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer. RealPlayer is a free media player you can download at www.realplayer.com. \n\nFor easy streaming or downloading use RealPlayer. Click the VBR M3U link to open the songs in the Playlist.

Repeat these steps for each song.\n\nEat, Drink, Be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nThanks for the Love from 1970.\n\nPS: Remember to click the \"DeadLists Project\" link and get the poster/handbill for this show.",

I particularly like how high in the mix Phil's bass is.  The Airplane were mediocre that night, with Marty Balin singing out \"I need a new band\" after the set, and Quicksilver played with horns!  Not a great show like 4/15/70, but a great set by the Dead.  No one around me that night had any idea Janis Joplin had died.  And contrary to the fanciful musings of Mr. Olson, I certainly didn't see any garbage pails of lsd.  If I had I wouldn't have been insane enough to drink 6 dixie cups.",

Some very interesting things going on here that are completely unique from other things I've heard the Dead do. That disk is legendary to me, and therefore this show is. \n\nThe jam after drums on Good Lovin', crazy Jerry followed by the trading of licks between everybody? The transition between China/Rider with Phil out front and Bob mixing up the soup? Some of the unique highlights for me. Great stuff.  \n\nI also had a Standing Sam picture disk, which I still have. 1970 acoustic set that turned out to be Dick's Picks #8 much later.",

      "review_text": "Quadcast <br />This show started as a one-off for the retirement of Quicksilver Messenger, along with Airplane (on their last legs), but stands out in Dead history because it was quadcast. Two stereo radio stations colluded to broadcast in quad (so, at home you needed one receiver tuned to each), and a TV station simulcast the vid feed. \n\nLater it became best known as the source for a vinyl boot that was re-pressed with several label names and covers. It was once so ubiquitous that, if you didn't have a tape connect, this was likely the only boot in your crates. A second night was added but has never emerged in trading circles. It may not have been AUD recorded and only one SBD track has emerged. Both shows were a single set, since they went on 1st and Airplane 4th.\n\nUnlike the FM reels, the vinyl boot (and therefore some digital sources) are half of the quad sound, being lifted from just one of the two FM feeds. It had:\nSIDE 1>Sugar Magnolia/Good Lovin'\nSIDE 2>end of China Cat>I Know You Rider/Casey Jones/Uncle John's Band\n\nAs pseudonym58 (and others) have pointed out, this was not a tight night for the band (\"we always blew the big ones\"), but the highlights average things out. <i>Till The Morning Comes</i> is the  2nd of only 6. It was dropped before it could be ironed. Though still rough, it's one of the best of the 6 (the other bests being 10/31 & 12/26). <b>American Beauty</b> had not been released yet. This is also the 6th <i>Brokedown</i>, and before it became an encore slot. It's very rough and with channels missing. Phil is hot this show and that's what drives an unusually good <i>China>Rider</i>. Jer's tone on his Guild[?] is great here. The rest sags down to a <i>Casey Jones</i> trainwreck. <i>Uncle John's</i> is the comeback but it's still a puzzling, random pick for a <b>Workingman's</b> bonus.\n\nOverall = C\n2\u00bd stars\n\nHighlight:\nChina Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider - gels, flows and soars on Phil and tonality\n\nSOURCES: The cotsman_4942 is the only source that isn't pitched slow, but the glassberg_winters_28363 has the most material, better clarity/image, has been cleaned up, and only <u>needs a +1% pitch adjustment</u>. Others play much too slow. Uncle John's Band is a bonus on <b>Workingman's Dead</b>. An average (though with a Tighten Up jam) Dancin' in the Streets from the following night emerged on <b>Download: Family Dog</b>.",
