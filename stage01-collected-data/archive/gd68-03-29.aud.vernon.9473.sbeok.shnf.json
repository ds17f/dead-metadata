Though I think the band has lost a bit of momentum after breaking through during the amazing Quick/Dead tour. This is still very special and certainly as good or better than the balance of what circulates from March.\n\nThis show blazes from the opening notes of Morning Dew through the tragically cut Born Cross Eyed. The high-point is, of course, the incredible nine minute New Potato Caboose, which just might be the best ever performed.\n\nClearly the best Aud of March, this gem rivals even 3/16 and 3/30 (sbds), not only sonically, but the playing is first-rate as well. Only 3/17 in Download Series quality is superior. \n\nWhat a shame we will never hear what just might be the best Born Cross Eyed ever played...",

I have to say honestly that this is a REALLY GOOD audience recording considering the technology of the day.    You can hear the people who were around the microphone, but the music comes through pretty clear.     Phil seems a little low, but the vocals are spot on.     Other than that, my only complaints are that Lovelight starts at what is probably about half way through the song & Born Cross-eyed has only 20sec of it.",

I believe Raoul Duke is a psuedonym for Hunter S. Thompson.  I believe that crazy bastard uploaded this.  How can you even critique this tape?  It's The Dead at the Carousel!  Listening to this is a mystical experience.  The bass is actually quite deep on this recording, and so cool as it sounds like it is reverberating into the halls of the old building.  Garcia's guitar is howling out long sustained notes on New Potato.  The shear artistry of this period is amazing.  This sounds to me like a genuine hippy archival recording.  It reeks of authenticity, and taped by a mad narcotics agent, how can you go wrong, you cop?",

      "review_text": "New Potato Caboose New Potato Caboose seems to have 4 elements to it. A graceful opening with spacey vocals, a groovy buildup, a howling guitar solo and a triumphant ending. Here is my poll on the best versions.\n\nFor the vocals, the honor goes to 10/12/68. Nothing beats the studio vocals but the ones on this particular show are very nice. Pig's absent and it's all Jerry in there.\n\nI believe the Valentine's Day '68 show has the best buildup to a guitar solo. Phil isn't soloing yet but the stuff he's playing is sending him on his way to Bass God Grad School. \n\nThe best ending, would originally have been the one from Two From The Vault but after gaining a further appreciation of electric bass and hearing what Phil plays behind Jerry on this version I'd have to go with the Fillmore West 3/1/69 version.\n\nAs for the best guitar solo, it's this one. No question about it. In terms of guitar solos on New Potato Caboose, Jerry never sounded as good as this in later versions. \n\nI'm not really a fan of the show besides New Potato. So, I'll give it 4.",
