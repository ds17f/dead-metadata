Musicially the show reminds of the tracks you'll find on the classic Dead album \"Europe '72\". The band is in fantastic form and locked into infectious groove all the way through the show. Sonically, the Wembley concert also reminds me on the sound found on \"Europe '72\". It has an excellent mix and balance, outshining numerous other live shows found here at archive.org. You can easily imagine that this recording was given the same treatment as the tracks that wound up on Europe 72. They seem to share the same sonic footprint. Of all the taped shows I've downloaded, I find this the most pleasant to listen to from an audiophile standpoint, really an excellent taping job and hghly recommended. And, as I've said, the band in also in peak form with this brisk sounding, tightly focused performance. By far, my favourite show to date. But, luckily, there's much more to shift through! Five stars, indeed!  :)",

But the Caution almost upstages it, very hot! The band was tight, well rehearsed,and on a mission from God tonight. All the songs are well played, Truckin and Playin especially. And the LL Rain with Jerry on pedal steel is really a rare treat. Jerry plays steel also on 4/14 - and I believe one other Euro 72 show. Anyone know? I've heard so much good Euro lately my mind is spinning! Get 5/11, 4/14, 5/26 and this one and you'll have some of the best from this tour. Enjoy bozos!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

The fellas never stop creating throughout the life of this Playin. The Good Lovin rocks also. This is another of those 72 versions which differs from the typical 1970 and 1971 versions in that there are no drums after the initial singing of verses. Pig is at the top of his game on this version. Jerry continues to snake through the woodpile, never concluding the seemingly endless string of notes which constitute every jam they ever did. This is some serious music here, kids! Strap into those seat belts and assume the position...  The Dark Star>Sugar Mag>Caution is everything everyone has already said. I used this particular jam to further entice a semi-DeadHead friend further onto the bus. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes of this Dark Star, he was totally feeling it. I say this alot, but I only say it when I mean it: your life is not complete without owning and knowing this show.

The Mind Left Body jam at the end is pure bliss. The Sugar Mag and Caution smoke, with Pig in the latter as good as ever. It's hard to believe that he would be dead less than a year later. \n\nBy all means necessary, get this show. Any fans of the '72 Dead are missing out if they don't have it.",

Gotta warn you if you haven't heard it - it's not for those with serious heart conditions.  The boys make it clear early on that they mean business.  This isn't one of those mellow, slow developing Stars of 73.  No, they go for the jugular with intense play from everyone even before the verse, but what comes after builds with a fury.  There's not really a Tiger here, but the whole band's wailing so hard it doesn't matter.  Crank this up and watch the music scale the stairway to heaven, then turn around and rip apart the fabric of space/time before your stunned, terrified ears.  But just as you're screaming, \"No, please, no more universes (destroyed)!\" they turn on a dime and settle into a mellow theme that forms a smooth segue into Sugar Mag.  It's not really a mind left body jam, although it has elements of that.  In case you weren't clear on what they were throwin' down, they then deliver a Caution worthy of that warning.\n\nThe rating is for the show, not the recording since that's been pulled.  I'm listening to my cassette recorded off the GD Hour.",

It's intense and exploritory and my favorite one they ever did including  02/13/70 at the Fillmore East. And the Caution as mentioned is one of the best, the best from this tour in any case. Combine those gems with the excellent readings of Mr. Charlie, LLR (with Jerry on pedal steel), Playin' In The Band etc., wow. Btw this is the tour where Bob Weir's rhythm guitar becomes god-like.\n\nBtw the Europe '72 box set of just the music is worth having despite its high price. The shows are available individually too. The best (so far) in my opinion are: 04/08, 04/11 (Newcsastle), 04/26 (Jahrhundert Halle), 05/03 (Paris), and 05/26 Lyceum, London). Tivloi 04/14 is great too.

      "review_text": "Another Great Night in the Swimming Pool Bertha\u2026 The boys, like the previous night, are fired up from the first notes. Jerry is in great vox to boot.\nMAMU keeps things moving nicely.\nMr. Charlie is nice and funky, one of few Pigpen songs that can keep up with what the Dead have started morphing into by 1972.\nDeal, while it hasn\u2019t become the song it will be, up till 1972, this is one of the better versions.\nBTW, well played, and not over sung.\nNext Time You See Me\nCumberland Blues rips, so hot they broke another string.\nBEW, great version here.\nBIODTL\nTN Jed has a nice payoff but pretty standard for this time. Energy maintained thus far through the set.\nPITB is driven and seers its way into your brain starting shortly into the jam segment. This short one covers all the bases while maintaining energy throughout. A+.\nGood Lovin\u2019 is a nice effort, omitting a long Pigpen rant that could get aimless, this ten minute version keeps things moving along nicely. Great Jer/Bob/Phil blast around 3 minutes in.\nLLR has Jerry is loud form, nicely out in front of the rest. He\u2019s got a great tone. If you like this song, you\u2019ll likely love this one.\nCasey Jones\n\nTruckin\u2019 is a great way to open the 2nd, and they fully rock it out.\nBig RR is short and rollicking. Great screeching guitar by Garcia.\nHurts Me Too would epitomize why Pigpen wasn\u2019t going to keep up with the direction he band was going. Yes, they held onto the blues, but he was a front man, and sinking to the rear with just a few songs, as the group slid more into Jerry\u2019s world\u2026 and Jerry runs the show on this one.\nDark Star>Sugar Magnolia>Caution\nThis long meat sequence of 3 songs allows all three of the primary singers to have a shot. Dark Star, I can\u2019t say enough about this, one of the most driven, intense Dark Stars out there, it will always be in my tops! Billy drives the intensity and much as Jerry, and it doesn\u2019t let go. Around 11 minutes in they slow it down enough to go into the verse. I love when they actually need to slow down a jam to go into the verse (of any song), it means you likely had your brain scattered. After the verse Billy gets on the cymbals slowing the pace, and they get spacey. The coming blast off starts just before the 18 minute mark, and again features Octopus Billy. Around 21 minutes things start getting creepy with a very interesting, almost circus like Pigpen buried in the background.  The jam is all over the place, maintaining a nice pace and staying fully exploratory. 28 minutes in they head into what strongly hints at the song they will eventually go into, 7 minutes later, Sugar Magnolia. Bobby, not ready to go there yet, starts the chord progression of the MLB Jam (though they hadn\u2019t \u201cplayed it yet\u201d). Sugar Magnolia officially hits when Bob changes his chords to those familiar chords. This is an energetic version, featuring a Bobby chuckle as he sings the lyrics. I wonder what made him laugh? Caution comes naturally right out of this with Phil and Billy pushing it out of the crashdown of SSDD. Billy has been on fire all night, meaning a great 20 minutes to close out the set! It stays pretty driven until about the 13th minute where it goes a little bluesier in content. The outro is tremendous! Great Caution. A+ meat sequence (if short).\n\nOne More Saturday Night\n\n\nPerformance Summary\nBack to back homeruns (7th and 8th) in London! This show doesn\u2019t really have many downs, and the highs are extremely good. The Dark Star, especially the last 7 minutes, amazing. Essential show.\n\nSound Quality\nA+ for official release",

I was just thinking that a lady friend and I took some L and then decided to listen to this and have sex together. Anyway, no need for me to go into any real details about the show, you all have covered it. Get the E 72 shows if you don't have them. I was lucky enough to get the trunk. I listened to every show in order and it was nice because I'm usually a jam/second set guy, and I realized how much I had missed the first set songs. The boys were on fire throughout the tour, and they really honed their skills. 72-74 are my favorite years, wish I could have been there.\n\nPeace & Love,\nSt. Stephen",

      "review_text": "Pigpen jams We all know this is one of the best ever. It leaves '77 in the dust. I had the semi-official bootleg that came out years ago with the Dark Star. I don't come back to this show that often, but it certainly is epic. Listening to the Star, I started to hear organ around the 19 minute mark. Keith was clearly on piano and the stereo mix has Keith and Pigpen in opposite channels. Yes Pig joining the jam, at the peak of it. Outside of the earliest '68 versions where Pig plays the repeating line in Dark Star, I have never really heard Pigpen playing in the thick of a jam. Kochman's review above recognized it also. Not a wasted minute of this Dark Star and some sheer beauty in all of it's psychedelic splendor!",

No audience interplay.\n\nThere is none of that magic between the audience of the band that makes some of these shows truly spectacular and is what I like best about this archive.\n\nI just don't get this one. The sound is great OK but it's like listening to an album.\n\nThey're probably not even on acid, I mean c'mon",
