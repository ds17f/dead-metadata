After a shaky year in 1971 - Mickey's father embezzling money (hence He's Gone), the loss of Mickey, the illness and return of Pigpen and the addition of Keith and a whole new sound - the Dead pull it all together and deliver an awe-inspiring performance. This is without question my favorite show of the year. Bobby storms out of the gate and amid popping balloons gives us a great Dancin- the last until 1976! Jerry shines on Tenn Jed and Loser. And the rare jam into Black Peter is a thing to behold. There are a few great Other Ones in 1971, 4/28, 8/6 and 11/7 come to mind. But this one is in a category by itself. After a thundering Truckin and starting off 1968 style (listen to Phil's playing!) the Other One settles into a long dreamy space scape that is quite unlike anything else up to this point. This version takes you to the outer planets and back again, with or without refreshments! The rest is almost anti-climatic, but they manage to bring the house down with NFA>GDTRFB. A show to reach for on special occasions, like New Year's Eve! A must have.\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

Heck, the whole second set is the highlight. Only bad song in the batch is Same Thing (Sorry, I love Pig but I'm so used to Bobby doing this one years later). According to Dead List this ultra-hot Big River is the first they ever played.\nOnly thing is that there is some chatter from the station DJ's through the show. Not too much but they do chat it up a bit during some songs and in between others. Oh well, it certainly doesn't take away from the recording. Judging by how fun this show sounds, they were probably having the time of their lives too. This is definately one to crank up for New Years. Play it loud! Oh yea- nice Dancin' opener too!",

      "review_text": "That's It For the Other One!!!!! The setlist on this one is very good, if a little long-winded. The 2nd set is awesome, though, a thoroughly delicious performance. The Dead sandwiched Me&My Uncle in the Other One several times, but this is the best performance they ever did with these songs linked together. Lots of spaced-out jamming in both Other Ones, as well as a one-of-a-kind transition from a completely out-of-nowhere Space into Black Peter. The only other time they did this kind of transition (that I know of) was 6/14/68, in which a spontaneous Space went right into The Eleven. Awesome. The NFA>GDTRFB>NFA is stunningly energetic and well-played, one of the best performances of these  three tunes. Worth it for the \nOther One>Uncle>Other One alone. Get it!",

Within 30 seconds\nI was a confirmed Deadhead - nearly a third of\na century later, I still listen to several hours\nof Dead daily.\n What was so earth-shaking was that the music sounded extremely familiar to me - in fact,\nthe overwhelming sensation was a shock of recognition the instant it started. I basically\ninstantaneously entered the culture - it was\nlike coming home after being away for years. Very strange.\n What's really annoying is not connecting to theDead at an earlier time. I lived in the Northeast in the early Seventies and could have\neasily seen every Boston show, Watkins Gen, etc.\n Anyhow,a  great show. Cosmic Cowboy Dead, one of\ntheir best phases.",

      "review_text": "I WAN-CHA TO ROCK ON OUT NOW This show smokes from the first notes. An amaizing dancing to kick it off. I mean amaizing. Shorter then some of the late 70s famous versions, it just has an extra kick to it. Great vocals backing up as well. If you are not the biggest fan of pig's vocal styling this show might change your mind. Jer forgets some lyrics in B.E.Woman. I'd like to know if the break/extra beat on the intro to BIODTL was intentional or not...well it worked just fine. Billy is really beating the crap out of his kit by this point and he does not let up. Great solo for BIODTL. Not much to say about You Win Again, I like it. Bob is so excited he can't seem to keep quiet. I love it. This J. Straw is interesting. In another year they would slow it down considerably before slowly building it to a throw-down in the late 80s. A short lived first year where they didn't really know what to do with it, just that it was a great tune. If you listen closely at the 2:10 mark or so there is a quick lovelight tease from Jer. Billy is just killing on this night, he really brings this J. Straw up a level or 5. Jerry's voice is heavenly on this Sugaree, really something incredible to hear. The song is still in its infancy but is already a powerful       non-ballad ballad. The China>Rider gets going with high hats popping left and right. Phil is really reaching high on the Rider. Even then he could still get it out. The playin' and loser here aren't much to talk about but Billy comes flying in again to kick of Saturday night...one of my favorite versions ever. Great Great first set. Funny intro to set II with the voice overs...Bill Graham gives a nice intro which slips right into a kickin truckin, things are really moving now...smoothness into a short drums...Shaft level smoothness into TOO Jam. At this point the 10 minute truckin is the longest tune of the night. The transition from TOO Jam to Uncle is seamless...daydream for more than 1 second and your lost, 3:00 later the same goes for the seque back into TOO. And as big and powerful the first 70 seconds is, within another 10 there is a calm flow happening, and suddenly, virtually nothing. I love the pig years alot, but with them even doing this in 71 it was obvious to everyone that Pig's place from there on would be as a front man now and again. Keith fills the spaces beautifully during this stretch of the show. They really seem to be flowing effortlessly through the gaps by the 5 minutes mark. This jam has 74 written all over it. The re-entry to TOO is nailed, this song can be so frightening sometimes...demonic even. But then lightened...just right, with a Black Peter. The remainder of the night is nice... the NFA>GDTRFB>NFA is quality for sure. Just one hell of a performance for a band not really sure of where its going or for that matter what the hell is going on. I am a very reluctant 5 star giver. 7.5/10 for sound, 8/10 for playing",

      "review_text": "Started on this date for me This is not a review of the music but a review of the start of my relationship with the Grateful Dead that has lasted from age 18 to current age 52. If that is not interesting please move on. Eighteen to 52 is amazing to me. I live in San Jose, 50 miles south of SF, now known as the capital of Silicon Valley. It is called a valley because we are in the Santa Clara Valley  (Santa Clara County). The Dead started in Palo Alto which is at the northern edge of Santa Clara County.  A large number of the famous companies you hear about started in Palo Alto and I was born there. I distinctly remember in High School as a Junior thinking who are the Grateful Dead? At that time, for my group of buddies, Crosby, Stills, and Nash were getting big and of course The Beatles were always Number 1 and to me are still the number one band of all time. Due to their longevity I have enjoyed the GD more than The Beatles but I bet even the Dead would agree that The Beatles were the best. If you didn\u00c3\u00c2t live through it you really can\u00c3\u00c2t appreciate the impact that The Beatles had not only on music but on life. Led Zeppelin was starting to become huge. I remember hearing Neil Young\u00c3\u00c2s Down By The River for the first time at lunch during school and thinking who is that? It is still one of my favorite songs. The Rolling Stones, The Who, Credence Clearwater, Cream, were all big. I graduated from High School in 1971 and the GD were still a mystery to me. Who are they? Then we all went off to college. One of my friends, probably the smartest person I have ever known even to this day, went to University of Santa Cruz. Well, they knew who the GD were there. For New Year\u00c3\u00c2s Eve he gathered us up and said let\u00c3\u00c2s go see the Grateful Dead. I had actually never been to a concert. My friends had gone to see Credence Clearwater Revival but that was it for them. We were the fairly cool but more the studious types. \n\nOff we went. New Year\u00c3\u00c2s Eve 1971. Winterland, San Francisco. Until the Archive came out I have been wondering for years if it was New Years Eve 1971 or 1972. We got there and only because of the archive, listening to the concert, I remember that at the start of the concert two guys came out with diapers and then pranced around naked. There was actually a middle walkway on the floor that they tried to keep clear. I think that was the only time I saw that in Winterland. It was sold out but not overwhelmingly like later years. After about five songs I was hooked. I had to get to the front. I made my way to around five rows deep right in front of Jerry. I knew his name and I think Pigpen but that was it. I did not know any of their songs. I remember Jerry signing some song about Tennessee. There I stood mesmerized from the middle of the first set to the end of the concert. About five songs before the end of the concert I was just standing there grooving and the girl in front of me, who had her arms around a guy, reaches back and grabs my crotch. I was pretty stunned. What is going on here? I let her hand stay there for a minute or two but was a little concerned about her arm being around the other guy so I removed it. I guess she was spreading love. I look back and think about how I left my friends all night but it was just too fascinating to leave the front. I remember them introducing Keith as their new piano player and Donna as their new singer. And yes, in my first concert I saw Pigpen perform. It turns out that became my only concert that I saw Pigpen. To me, those are big bragging rights for a DeadHead. I saw Pigpen perform with the Dead. Also fascinating to me is that 12/31/71 was just before one of their greatest periods, Europe 72. After 12/31/71 the Dead became a big part of my life. I bought all of their albums and Bob Weir\u00c3\u00c2s Ace album has become my favorite of all time. I want to be buried with that album (cassette/whatever form it is in). After 70 \u00c3\u00c2 80 concerts and two years of downloading from GDLive and the Internet Archive I even appreciate them more. Will it ever stop? I don\u00c3\u00c2t know, hasn\u00c3\u00c2t yet.",

As far as the show being sped up is concerned I don't think it was. Jerry is clearly heard after BIODTL remarking on how fast they played it and Bill K. is drumming at his most furious throughout the show, doing rolls and fills I'd never heard him play before.

Same Thing hadn't been played since '67 and this was the last Pigpen version, Bobby taking it up again 20 years later. This is also the first show with Donna, though she's not a big presence. She would officially join at the upcoming Academy shows.\n\nFirst Set. It's actually '72, and Bobby isn't happy with the balloons on stage (he later admitted he wasn't a fan of the NYE parties and the balloon drop). Unfortunately the first song has a voice-over from an idiot. Jer is a genius on the 2nd measure of <i>Mr. Charlie</i>. The good <i>Brown-Eyed Women</i> is uptempo (even after pitch correction)  but <i>Beat it On Down the Line-7+2</i>  is a bit slopped. Note that the approach to <i>You Win Again</i> changed right after this, for '72. The set is then average-to-rough until <i>Tennessee</i>. Also uptempo, Jer gets a little lost but still whips one out by t'end. You wouldn't expect the first <i>Chinatown</i> to be a great one. By <i>Mexicali</i> they're just not gelling - though NYE shows are usually pretty scattered. I like that Phil is pseudmotorik in places in <i>China Cat</i>, giving it a forward lean and simultaneous lowride cool, despite the lack of tight playing this set. From here through <i>Rider</i> is the best jamming of the set. There's a few-second glitch in <i>Playing in the Band</i> @3:40. It has a concise jam - but tight Dead it's not. <i>Loser-SS</i> is better but <i>One More Saturday</i> is weirdly tentative compared to months later. It has the \"young and crazy can't see reason one\" lyric and the 1st Donna appearance - though you can't really hear her.\n\nSecond Set. 1st they play a <i>Stars & Stripes Forever</i> while asking Graham to the stage, then Keith plays a <i>Charge! Fanfare</i>. Things first improve on <i>The Other One</i>. Interestingly,  it already sounds very E72, and it doesn't lyrically resolve before <i>Me & My Uncle</i>. On the latter, Bobby plays in the key, Jer signals the opening notes, and Bobby then launches the lyrics directly - it's really cool. Billy pushes to go back into <i>The Other One</i>. Weirdly, it breaks down again after the verse, when Bobby stops and then Billy, before an interesting Jam into <i>Black Peter</i>. There's a brief segue missing on both this source and the official release, after Jer does the opening chords for Black Peter the first time, before it dissolves into the jam. Bobby follows him, but nobody else does, then Jer drops it for a couple minutes. It's an interesting, sort-of-unique section, but <i>Black Peter</i> is just average. Note the placement of the first <i>Big River</i>. Unfortunately a bit of the beginning is cut, but it's not bad - Jer already knew where to go with it. On this version, Jer takes the 2nd verse (though he forgets it), and Billy plays a shuffle - they would change this when they brought it back. In the meantime, they dropped it, not playing it through E72 (they diddled with it during soundcheck at Luxembourg, with Jer singing), finally bringing it back in Boston in September, with Bobby singing. <i>The Same Thing</i> is plucked back into existence but it seems they have to wing it a bit as a result. Even though it's now the wee hours, the rest of the show is best. <i>Ramble</i> is still pretty uptempo after pitch correction, and the end jam of <i>Sugar Magnolia</i> is great and very '71. Jer's fills are what makes <i>Not Fade</i> (Bobby being a ways out of tune). Jer is then way warmed up for <i>Goin' Down the Road</i>. His playing here echoes '67 (maybe from playing Same Thing again?). Neither the best nor the worst of the seven 70s NYE shows .\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 3 stars\n\nHighlights:\nThere are some tidbits of historical nature but otherwise>\nMr. Charlie - tightest of the night\nGoin' Down the Road Feeling Bad - Jer at his most fluid; echoes of '67\n\nSOURCES: The lanum.135 source is from the FM broadcast but is culled from sources transferred at different speeds, so the <u>pitch is all over the place</u> - from fast to helium fast. The First Set <u> needs -1%</u> from Dancin' through You Win Again. Jack Straw and Sugaree need -2%, then El Paso speeds way up, needing -3%. Chinatown Shuffle is <u>hyperspeed and needs -4%</u>. Tennessee then needs -2%. Mexicali through Next Time plus One More Saturday Night need -3%. But, in between, Playing and Loser only need -1%. The second set doesn't run as crazy fast but still requires correction of -2%, except for the first three (Truckin>Drums>TOO) and Casey Jones, which need -1% (MaMU has a slow pitch change). The end of TOO jam and Black Peter are on some copies of <b>The Closing of Winterland</b>.",

      "review_text": "Who has the un-edited soundboard/broadcast? I love the couple of shows per year that just don't sound like any other shows - this is one of 'em, evident from the get-go, with this unique jammy Dancin In The Streets.  I think there is a lot of cocaine inspiration - the songs are generally faster and more urgent, but also played deadly serious musically, especially for a New Years, like they had something to prove with all the new material, new lineup etc. I think Kreutzman is the MVP of the night.  My favorite Jack Straw ever, and lots of great song performances. \nThere's a great Bobby rap that has been cut out of this edited upload - I wish someone would upload an un-edited version to the archive. As I recall it: Bobby: \"Well I hope to tell you this stage is a fucking mess, and if you've got bare feet, don't get near it....... And a big hello to all you folks listening out there in Radioland, now that I was just informed that we're on the radio.\" Jerry: \"And you too, Mr. HOOVER!\" (J.Edgar Hoover, evil head of the FBI, for you  young'uns.)    Bobby: \"I 'll tell you all a little story......It seems that way back in 1956, J Edgar Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower and a bunch of those guys had a little conspiracy plot... ...and what happened was they all got together and decided there weren't gonna be no more New years, it was gonna stay 1956 til the end of time.... and, well, they did it, and you people have all been duped, and it's really 1956, although it's nothing to get excited about..... Now we're gonna tune up.\" Kudos to Bobby - a funny riff to blow the minds of a room full of peaking acidheads. Also edited out was the moment later in the first set when Bobby explained that the organ and piano weren't in tune with each other, and they were going to have to decide which to tune to, a problem with hammond organs in rooms with bad power regulation, because they require close to spot on 110 voltage to play in tune, which explains why there's no Pigpen organ along with Keith's piano, as there had been throughout the Europe tour for example. \nI listened to the broadcast live and taped it onto a little cassette player, giving me a headstart as a 14 year old guitar player learning all the new tunes that would appear over a year later on Europe '72 in slower, vocally emasculated versions - in addition to re-recording the vocals on the 'live' triple LP in the studio post production, it sounds to me like they slowed down the masters slightly to record the vocals at a slightly lower, easier to nail pitch, then sped it all back up to 'normal', resulting in an unnatural, slightly chipmunky vocal sound. This show was always a benchmark for tougher, cooler versions, especially vocally.",
