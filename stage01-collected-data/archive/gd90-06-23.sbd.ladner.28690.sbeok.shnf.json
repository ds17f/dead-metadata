The playing, the song selection, the flow of energy from one song to the next, each of these shows is perfect in its own way.  You get every song you could want too (except Dark Star but I didn't care for Dark Star in 1990).  The first show in particular is just incredible.  Feel Like A Stranger is well-jammed, Far From Me is especially poignant considering what would happen in a month, Cassidy is my favorite all-time version - very intense jam.  Eyes is very well-paced and interesting throughout and Looks Like Rain (not my favorite song) is exceptional.  Crazy Fingers is always welcome, the Playing isn't particularly memorable but UJB is excellent.  The final highlight is Morning Dew, but as I said the energy and flow is perfect and all tunes are enjoyable and fit in nicely.",

The music simply pops. \nIn the first set the Me and My Uncle>Cumberland is well done. I know alot of you don't care for Brent tunes but how can you say no to this passionate rendition of Far From Me. The Cassidy is worth a mention. Overall average first set for the year.\nThe second set is heartwarming, fist-pumping, Jerry winking, platinum. Listening to it sometimes leaves me unable to listen to anything else for 10 minutes or so. I have to sit without music for awhile and reflect on how good it was.  The eyes is wonderful, the L.L.Rain is one of my favorties. Jerry's tone falls more to an spring 1981 flavor for it. The next segment has to be one of the better 1990 musicical webs.\n\nCrazy Fingers-> Playin' In The Band-> Uncle John's Band-> Playin' In The Band-> Drums-> Jam-> The Wheel-> I Need A Miracle-> Morning Dew\n\nThe L.L. rain flows into Crazy Fingers but belongs with the Eyes when discussing the show. Crazy Fingers through Dew is stunning. You have to hear it. I won't attempt describing highs and lows. Its late era dead with all their cards down. Everyone in the band is on and hearing eachother and I'd imagine having a blast. That is all.",

There is a special quality to the sound of the GD between 1989 and summer 1990, and if you're looking here, you are likely to understand. This recording is phenomenal, and it's really too bad we can no longer download it. They will probably never release this show officially, and so here it sits in limbo. I was at the whole run of western shows from Cal Expo, Shoreline, and Eugene just topped them all. This town was sacred land for the GD/Prankster Galaxy, and if you ever went there you know. How often did you see Bill Graham trucking around shows outside the Bay Area? Some sort of *magick* got into everyone including the band and crew. The band is on as if they had been rehearsing. PITB->UJB->PITB is just fantastic for any era. The sound here is tremendous, with a nearly perfect sonic balance (marred only by a few minor splices). I hope enough people d'l'ed this while it was available so it can be spread around. Either that or make it an official release - this is a keeper.",

Saw the whole run of the west coast shows and with Keasey and Uncle Bobo running around the parking lot  plus the 2:00 start made for some really fun parties  after the show. The recording here gets only 4 and half stars because of a couple of glitches in an otherwise super-crisp sounding show.  The show it self however is 5 stars hands down. The thing that struck me most about this performance is the way Jerry is leading the band and everyone is listening with intensity, making for some of the smoothest song transitions I've heard yet. They find the groove in the first 10 seconds of Stranger and it builds from there. Not a mediocre song in the bunch and several top tier contenders. I'll mention also since most of the other songs of note  have been hit upon that the drums will blow your mind as well as a very sweet Wheel that has a nice slower tempo for a change. Anyway I'm going to rate this 5 stars which should leave this show where it belongs at 4 and a half stars.",

Heavens, seventeen years ago. By Jove, the Boys put on what I later identified as a Homeric performance (if Achilles had an iPod, right?).  All was in place.  How did I know anyway, it was my first run, but all was clearly made evident. I never saw such a thing, and I doubt that I ever will, and I even attended a score of other Dead shows thereafter.  Eugene in 1990 was Something Special.  Kesey wandering the grounds.  Uncle Bobo on patrol.  Strange hissing emissions from the campground (we could camp there too!). And, we get to keep this wonderful recording, and yes, I agree that this one of the best shows of the Era.  Keep this recording close.",

After the Stranger opener, I bumped into a friend and she said What's up? I said, wow, great show, guess I'll go home, she said, the show just started. We looked at the stage and were unable to determine of the band was playing or not. I could not tell if I was sitting down or standing. The Eugene football team was working security and while wandering the stadium, I fell in behind one of these jocks with a white Tshirt and the word SECURITY across his back. I couldn't leave him, just locked on ike it was all I could do to save my sanity. West LA swirled like a giant stadium stew, churning and stirring up like a trippy magic witches potion. Wheel had ringing chandeliers of sound, just mond blowing at the time. It was very hot that day, I fried all day and rode my bike home, just DONE OVER by the Dead once again. Thanks boys, you were the best!",

Bobby, Jerry, Brent, and Mickey feed off each other, and the energy level improbably increases to a beautiful climax.  I could listen to those 3 minutes over and over again.",

There's hardly any \"edge\" anywhere (that tension-resolution dynamic that's so hard to derscribe), as if they're just going through the motions. They also didn't pull anything out, more evidence that they just didn't really feel all that into it: it's a greatest hits show, with everything OK but nothing really hitting all that great.",

Love how everyone is expecting 'Big river', and you can hear it take a couple of seconds for it to click (for the crowd); very sweet!  'Uninspired' my ass..this show is very inspired and a top five of a great (last Brent) run. most shows in Spring/Summer '90 were four stars (playing quality); this is a five. Sound is a five also. Don't remember if this is a CM production or not, but sending out love to him anyway.",

After years of listening to all 150 shows I saw from 86-90, this is the one.....\n\nI was 20, and it was summer off from college in Colorado....\n\nWe had gone to Cal Expo a few weeks before, then seen 2 smoking hot Garcia band shows on 6-12-13 at the Warfield.....Can't remember why i didn't go to Shoreline, think I went mountainering....\n\nArrived in Eugene with Elise....I will never foregt being throughly in love, and staring into her eyes for hours after this show and sleeping on a bike path in the bushes somewhere near a friends house....\n\nThe show- I could rave about it all, but the Eyes of the world is just so incredible...\n\nThe boys come out for set II and Jerry is ready...He starts noodling into Eyes with incredible little licks...amazing...then the drummers roll right in into a beatifully flowy moment.....Everyone is ON, and its perfect....\n\nGarcia's lick at 1:08 gives me chills everytime...I have heard it a hundred times at least....The drummers weave an incredible rthtyhm throughtout the tune, and garcia goes to his Midi later in the jam....Beautiful.\n\nThe LLR is also a mindblower, with crackling thunder effects towards the end and an ultra inspired Bobby...\n\nI remember there was this bouncy green astro-turf on the field at the stadium; Bouncing on it during that LLR and it felt like it was a mini trampoline....\n\nOther highlights are a killer Cassidy and a monumental Morning Dew...T\n\nhis was the absolute height of the Dead.....I know some will disagree. My favorite years are like 71, 74, 76-77, 82, select 84, and 87.....But the run up from 89 into 90 before Brent died, was the peak in my opinion. This show captures the magic that was....",

I saw my first show 12/1/79 my first tour was Spring 85 and this period is still my favorite at least music wise. these 2 shows were killer although this my favorite of the 2 at a killer venue great end to the West coast run before Summer Tour started",

I hadn't seen the Dead play for 2 years and was wondering if they still had it. My answer came emphatically during TLEO - Jerry's guitar tone is so clear and prominent - gorgeous! Promised Land brought the house down. Then Eyes set sail on the serene seas of musical bliss - those opening notes are just so silky smooth.This was one of those stadium shows that felt intimate - the PA sounded incredibly clear - there was no wind to interfere - and you standing at the top in the back (as I was) you could see and hear the audience react to the music so it really felt like this beautiful group experience.",

One of my biggest regrets is not catching more of that period of the Dead, only getting to the three Tinley shows (the end of summer tour with Jerry getting tired and Brent, well, nuff said).  Who would have thought, as recently as spring 89, when they were running through short performances of the same old standards, that the good old Grateful Dead had this kind of creative explosion coming?  This show suffers from the inclusion of Me and My Uncle, Far From Me (can it be even farther from me?) and I Need a Geritol, but those are trifling flaws.  There's so much good stuff here (Feel Like a Stranger, Cassidy, Eyes, Uncle John's Band, even Tennessee Jed), culminating in a huge set ending Dew.  ",
