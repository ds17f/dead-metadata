Santana played a full 2 hour set and really ripped it up.  The sound was not an issue for Carlos and Co. so it cracks me up that the band with the best equipment in the land sounded awful....and yes, there were massive problems during \"Sugaree\" but the band prevailed.  Long show,...the 2nd set didn't start until midnight which made me think they were going to open up the 2nd set with \"In the Midnight Hour\"...but it didn't happen.",

      "review_text": "Skippable but not a Bust;  Jerry had a difficult time both singing and playing This three night set is getting the highest of recommendations. (wink-wink) \n1st Set: Bobby's in good voice during a cluttered slightly unfocused but harder rocking and more exciting \"Hell\" than Monterey. Its partner \"Sugaree\" is airy, (terrible flub at 11:13 and later on) and long (13 minutes plus) but the drummers make sure it's never sluggish. It's time for Brent to share with us some of his \"Good Time Blues.\" Now there's whole lot of nothing goin on here, but it's all listenable because of the brisk tight pace of the drummin. \"Iko\" is similiarly appealing and yet empty. At least they're consistent, \"Walkin.\" More innocuous white-meat blah with \"Push.\" From the sounds of this recording, is 'the Dome' one of those ultra-spacious arenas built of the 70s? I ask because this recording, although clean -  if too high on the treble, sounds remote. \"Masterpiece\" is fine, but it sounds as if Bobby's shouting rather than singing. Despite flowing, \"Row\"'s instrumentation is dull; Jerry seems uninterested in providing the requisite effort tonight. And he's certainly not capable of providing any muscle behind his solos and the groove established by the band during the set closing \"Music.\" Some decent twilling and highs achieved, but it's everyone besides Jer. \n\n2nd Set: About thirty seconds is clipped off of \"China.\" Don't doubt the band's capabilities tonight - Jerry's in and out...he does manage to make the ending climax exciting. Like most of the show, Jerry will spend thirty seconds blahly ruminating and use that pontification into a thread of notes that inspires glee because the band has fashioned a solid backdrop. \"Playin\"'s song is danceable.  There are enough 'alerting' noises during the next five minutes so I'm never bored. Jerry does need help though singing and leading the way during \"UJB.\" \"Drums\" is filled wioth more Geisha-lite stylings (what is that xylophone type of instrument Mickey is playing?) Generic toolings during \"Space\" lead to a rare \"Touch\" emerging out of noiseland. Odd choice especially considering Mr. Garcia's fallability with mustering the requisite vocal energies to sing a song. However, it could be said that Jer was aware of his faults tonight and chose the song to egg himself on or as a reminder that he still had almost seven years of life ahead of him. Anyways, \"Miracle\" does its crowd-pleasing job; gotta admire Bobby for not minding pandering. Parts of this \"Black\" are sour and just painful to listen to... 'see how everything..leads us to this day...' parts are standard. \"Lovelite\" is fine and gets the crowd semi-frenzied. \n\nMore \"Black\" this of the 'Muddy' type...ehhh dragged out sticky -  not needed. \n\n2 3/5th stars rounded up cause I learned something in fifth grade.",

As far as sound quality of the download, I've downloaded shows here that had worse quality yet better reviews.  After \"good time blues\" the show for me is quite listenable on cd.\n    As far as the band...Yeah, Santana was great, but the Dead were pretty damn good too.  I had an excellent time at the show and I'd venture to guess that the majority of the people in the dome did also.  I admit, it wasn't their very best performance ever, but it certainly wasn't the worst either.  All in all I think it was a pretty rockin' show.  If every performance over the years was just spot on perfect...Hell, that's impossible!  Let's give 'em a break.\nAnyways I enjoy the show and will continue to listen to it, give it a try.  On a side note, I don't recall it raining cats and dogs that night as a previous reviewer mentioned. The whole summer in tacoma was hot and dry.  It was sunny when we got to the show, and I didn't get wet hitching a ride to Porland after the show in the back of a pick-up. (not saying you're wrong though, it was 19 years ago after all.)",

Santana did not sound at all like the Dead, which was unfortunate. Wiki Tacoma Dome for all the details about the structure, as it is unique. \n\nAs far as the HHM in Minneapolis, the echos were so very bad that even up front there were echo's and feedback. As I recall, when Petty and Dylan were playing, the speaker stacks made a most ???HORRIBLE NOISE???, which only added to the confusion and audio nightmare for all parties! Definitely the worst sounding structure that I have EVER heard! \n\nBack to Tacoma.........the moon over Mt. Rainer in the night sky background after the show was certainly a highlight for me, as it was natures beauty at it's finest! I would go back and do it again, if I could, who wouldn't ??",

I enjoyed it, though; I was high as a kite, standing just a few people back from the stage, smack dab in front of Garcia with a good view of both him and Hart. I don't mind saying that Santana kicked the Dead's ass this night, but I peaked during Sugaree. I saw every expression on Garcia's face, including the pained, apologetic grimace when blaring gouts of feedback howled through his mic and threatened to explode our skulls at the end of Sugaree. The jam during Playin' was loud and obnoxious, very fitting for the room, and I thought that was pretty cool. But as some reviewers have theorized, and as I can attest to for a fact, Garcia at least was not having a good time and couldn't wait to get off stage. This recording is tinny and needs EQing, not unlike the show itself. I don't think it sucked, and I don't know if it was the worst I ever saw, but I only find it remarkable for the memories; there are so many better shows. I was deliriously still singing the second song as we headed out that night and drove to Eugene for the next one, and my friends thought that was hilarious.",

fooLs try to emulate...besides,it was only and totaly about the way it made u feel and ..cuZ,play guitar= pussy ...even the non talented know that..loL...being said,no musician will ever come off stage thinking he or she had just given their all...and that perfection defined the show..or song or even one noTe...and when I read the posts typed with the eloquence of a baboon,by someone who'd seen thingz and heard the same show,been to the same shows,knowing they left with the same undeniable grin..ear to fuckin ear as I had..and as did many...(then,theRe weRe those who had no choice...i too,was encouraged to smile,it was the water)anywho...its... only yearz laTer wheN heaRing whaT enhanced high def audio and eq's bring into the musIc,thaT for no other reason except,cuz we simply felt we NEEDED to be theRe...wouLd driVe coast2coast for,moRe times than youR vehicLe had spare engines for...not to mention.. everything ...life,aLways seemed on the path,id only heard of such path,but a 9to5 job and two days for R and R seemed awfully short,not to mention a wife...and kids???..me?...thats not liFe as I looked upon the worLd ..and theRes your 1st show,and not to beLieVe that a bigger moRe confusing life waS right in front of you..and IT FOUND YOU...and a guy,Jerry his naMe..\"Captain\"trips to some...but,afraid of how being capTain..or leader would change whaT had been havin fun,impressing young girlz on saturday niTe..into 165,000+day in and out...musically unheard of on the music charts scoring only the one top10,yet topping the charts of any all bands that toured in attendance by margins even elvis,beatles, or whoever could compete with..becuz one thing was missing...they only sold tix for concerts...just music...Grateful Dead sold a ticket to ride!...and it seemed like magIc was I remembered as beIng so facsinating,yet without words to explain its way of grabbing all those who beLieved in the power of what a smiLe on a boys face can do...especially,when that sMiLe ignites meaning and worth inside...im sorry for all the leading...though finished im not...but,how why is posting one mistake,faults or simply the effects of beIng himseLf..hes a musician..a magic maker..hes Light at the end of a long dark fuckin tunnel..and together they changed music...and lives...didnt need a top.40 hit when it didnt need a radio...it filled the mindz of those before me,spreading word of mouth kept what hurts any beautiful creation...perfection...jerry always took his guiTar ...from gibsons and les paul..to wolf to bolt...creaTed by a stranger,outta kindness and what bettet to give back,to the one who made a believer out of a cabinet/firework maker...to which without the.\"inspiration\"..whos to say wheRe paths woulda ended...with all that seemz  to be nothing short of greatness and ability to steal the hearts of so many people and in its place filled it with feeling of ...an emotion that cant be obtained...its material that a ticket could buy...its LoVe on a scaLe NO chart on the radio can possibly do..to make mistakes is what makes everything so beautiful when...if the closest I ever get to perfection is the time spent traveling with the grateful dead the music that seemed almost written for me..and also fortunately for thousands of others...then if im wrong about believing that heaven and hell were pages torn from mother goose,ok..if not,atleast comparing the two will keep me busy in hell...it also assured me that there is good people everywhere...and the what if whispers,speaking on terms on a grand scale..the world could be better,becuz of US!...cuz to say,the worLd is unpredictable and violent...is an understatement..and its the few perfect ones who seem hell bent on keepin it that way...when,it is really as easy as a smile...and the want to put one on the person next to you...its contagious..addictive..and nothing cures anything like something....with a reason to be NICE...all of which weRe done outta want from the heart of a man whos way of life was not so perfect,noT so clean cut..and not so fortunate to escape disease and addiction,that alone destroys entire dreams..along with people that slept through them so they could  be enjoyed by them...yet,he surrounded  himself with those people,and became they reason  and he did what he wanted...played guitar,for us.. those whose ear was benT,to hear His tune...if thats not enuff to overlook..or let go of..or just change your mind..before pointing out a wrong note or lyric....think of why he did things his way...and that a weight sat on his shoulders we as a whole would turn away from with quickness that even the monkey that also sat upon his shoulder,would let go of...meaning ,he have to choose between playin guitar and the music that  gave reason to all withen earshot of it....nothing can be more hateful and wwrong than to say his mistakes and miscues..or his appearance...anyone,myself included had bad hair days on tour..dreads dont like combs...and most of all his untimely death was directly in result of an addiction...let the good shine through...without nitpickimg a song he fucked up in 1985!!...youDe think it was who wrote and composed the music we all love...but,if im wrong About ANYTHING...i know that jerry talent wasnt his imperfection,talent isnt somethimg you lose,and taking what you know to be the sweetest sound to ever have graced your fucking ears and mind and blaming an addiction thats purpose is to destroy a life in ways im all too familiar with....yet when you got to the show...he never let you down,he was there..and like the post prior...i too never left a bad grateful dead show...in fact,im convinced that hearing loss is to blame for not so nice comments for a majority..the ones with sence to know when to shut up...becuz even a smartass baboon,who acts like he knows everything..always had a monkey that could always smack some sense back in..and put him back in his place in the order of confuses perfection...a happy medium...buy,wrong none the less....leave your complaints where they are...and tell us why u Love him..nobodys perfect",

I had heard about the experience but wasn't really familiar with the music.  The big plus for me was Carlos Santana opening the show.\n\nA short drive and a couple of tokes later I was blown away by the Dead experience.  I still wasn't hip to the music but  I sure did enjoy watching the scantly dressed girls dancing.  I caught another show a while later and thought it sucked (turns out it was a bad night... I found that show too).\n\n25 years later I was reintroduced to the music and this time it stuck. I now listen to old shows weekly and have begun to play (on guitar and with a band) many of the songs.   I'm so happy I could locate my first show.  My only regret now is not having followed The Dead earlier in my life.",

I saw them first in '77 and this Tacoma show was almost my last. The sound was soooo terrible that I actually have no memory of whether the show was worth a damn or not. I've never felt actual excruciating physical pain from high volume before that night, but I just wanted OUT of that place it was so bad. I actually left early, disgusted. The only time that EVER happened with a Dead show. \n\nI started seeing them again in '93 after we'd moved to the east, and I stayed in until the end, not because they were much good, but because it was pretty clear Jerry was a finite resource that wasn't gonna be around very long and I wanted to soak up as much as I could. But this show just about blew it for me. All of the good \"comeback\" vibes from '87 were shot, Jerry was back on the junk, and this show about killed it for me. I'm listening to it now and it's kind of typical semi-OK GD when you don't have to worry about physical pain. But I can't get past the bad memories...",

The only thing that was sort of annoying was the exuberant army dudes that were drunk enough to dance and bounce into people. They were big fans and friendly enough but some folks weren't into it.  There was a dude who looked like Carlos Santana wandering the parking lot before the show.  He had a battery powered amp and an electric guitar and he was just wailing! Oh, and he said to me \"something interesting's going to happen to the moon.\"   I'd have to look it up but I think there was an eclipses or something that night   4 stars for that experience alone.

It's all in your mind, you can have an excellent time during challenging circumstances, even a happy day. This is why the U.S. is turniing into a cesspool of negativity because like the comments on this thread people are selfish and constantly fixate on the negative. When you have Santana and then Garcia you are getting a gift that is priceless, an experience that is unique. It's the little experiences that make a person happy, enjoy the moment, stay in the present. The irony in your mind is you fixate on your own problems all the time in selfishness while ignoring the suffering all around you, this is why people become miserable and depressed. You can begin to wake up from the negativity it's not too late. Here's a tip: start caring about everything around you then you will see the beauty in the day. If you don't want to live in the dark cloud malaise like most humans begin to be aware, use your sensory perception.",

      "review_text": "great performances, dreadful room acoustics Both Santana's set and the Dead's were fantastic.  Santana was in peak form in these years.  But the venue is an acoustic nightmare with its plywood sheet dome.  If you were in real close to the stage and were hearing the stage monitors in your face instead of the room PA sound bouncing off the ceiling, the sound was good enough.  Otherwise, dreadful.  Both bands were on fire but I guess lost on most of the audience -- except us rail rats.  ",
