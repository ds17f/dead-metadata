The don't ease is great, also played a few other times that month, Phils sounds great on Box of Rain, may be the best version out there other than the hissy sole 70 version, Donna isn't over whelming.

Really the TLEO is at it's peak.\n Phil's voice is great, don't listen to any critizism, sure he's no American Idol, but he is essential to the dead sound and harmony, Don't you find it ironic that Phil's got the deepist voice yet he's often singing the highest harmony part, while Jerry with the highest voice sings low, and Bobby right in the middle, pricless.\n\nemail me at fieldhouse11277@hotmail.com  happy to share with good listeners",

I mean the sound reproduction is excellent. Here exists an abundant delivery of clams and guitar mistakes both Bobby and Jerry. Even Phil makes goofs and occasionally they get lost -- especially in the first set. On a number of songs the band sounds  unrehearsed. Nonetheless, it's good stuff pretty much all the way through. \n\nPerhaps my previous review was a bit over the top.\n\nYet, despite all the muffs there stands a fine champagne taste to this affair.

Truly a marathon, they played until past 1 am, with only a 45 minute break in the middle.\n\nThe most poignant moment was during \"He's Gone\".  PigPen had recently died, and his single organ note during each playing of the chorus of this song was deafening in its absence!\n\nI went with a group of my sister's friends (she was at Penn at the time.)  One of them was Eric Bazillian - who eventually became the lead guitar player for the Hooters.  That night, he told me that he had seen the Dead close to 20 times, and this show was EASILY the best!",

      "review_text": "King Ghidorah of shows Little did I know going in to this show that the picture I used to pitch it to you all was so appropriate. The picture was of King Ghidorah. This mythical beast was a genetically mutated, lightning breathing three headed dragon from outer space that is capable of interplanetary travel. After paying very close attention to this particular show, I realized the monster in the picture and the show were virtually one in the same. Rarely have I been affected by a show the way I was with this one. I have listened to it many times before, but I don\u2019t think I really heard it until this past weekend. A 31 song powerhouse of mythical proportions. \n\nThe first head of this beast consists of the fourteen songs that start the first set, Bertha>>El Paso. Pure swagger in these near flawless renditions of their cowboy rock standards. Right away I noticed Phil and how heavy his shit was this evening. He and Billy are really on point this evening and keeping perfect time. I enjoyed every one of these tunes and Jerry really set the tone during the first solo in BIODTL. He immediately starts trading with Keith and it is ON! I really dig the fact that all of the tunes have very heavy, albeit smaller jams throughout. Even Ten Jed and LLR worked for me here. You can hear the confidence they are playing with coming right through on the recording. Just phenomenal stuff right here. \n\nThe second head of this beast starts with Sunshine and ends with MAMU. HCS is damn near perfect and clocking in under ten minutes. Every aspect is present here and pulled off beautifully. The anticipation is palpable and Jerry\u2019s vocals are as good as they ever were. The jam is significant and not drawn out too much. I think this tune needs to be under ten minutes to be right. It is and it is! Killer! Now we come to Playin\u2019 and this would definitely be the highlight of the show if not for the third head of this lightning breathing beast. This one clocks in under twenty minutes and is executed with vigor. Bobby\u2019s vocals are on point and even Donna\u2019s harmonies sound great to me this evening. This one drops in at the three minute mark and immediately throws you in the deep end of the pool. Underwater licks from Jerry melting into a waterfall of harmony accentuated front and center by Phil once again. He is dropping bombs left and right and he downright owns this part of the beast. This is about the point I started to really notice Bobby\u2019s work here. Incredible. The last significant portion of this \u2018head\u201d is the China>Rider. It follows a very quick and well executed TMNS, and it seemed like they wanted to get to this one right away. More of the cowboy swagger from the first set is evidenced here right away. This one is about as tight as they come and again, every element is present and accounted for. Everyone contributes and as usual and Bobby\u2019s rhythm really controls this one nicely. They follow this one with one of the finest Big Rivers\u2019 I have ever heard. A dynamite speedball with Jerry breathing lightning the whole time. \n\nNow, the third head of this monster is where the heart of the beast really lies. He's Gone > Truckin' > Spanish Jam > Dark Star > Sing Me Back Home > Sugar Magnolia is a jam worthy of the mythical beast status I have bestowed upon this show. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be Astounding. Right from the jump you can tell there is a little something extra in the air as Phil bounces right along with Jerry so effortlessly. Beautifully patient and tempered, just the way a classic storytelling song should be. Jerry\u2019s first solo is just enough to pick up the pace some, but not too much. They remain mellow and heavy right on through this one and the anticipatory energy is contained very well. The last few minutes are accented really nicely with Jerry doing some great bendy/slidy soloing and trading with Bobby. This fades right into Truckin\u2019. Now this is the part that gets interesting right here. It starts off innocently enough but gets wound and wound and wound with jerry\u2019s unrelenting soloing starting about halfway through this one. Phil ever present in the background pounding away even the most gentile of notes. It backs off ever so slightly with Phil coming to the front more and more every time around. It ends up slowly fading into the abyss with a gentle ease. The transition is one for the ages. Phil slinks around for about the first minute or two of the jam and then the third head of this mythical beast rises once again with Jerry and Billy going full tilt into this one. The work right here by Phil and Jerry is pure jazzy bliss inspired by the speed that Billy is keeping. Full on interplanetary travel going on right here. GD bliss without question. The question is not whether or not they are high right here, but more like how high can they take it? They answer rather quickly as I hear the first few riffs of Spanish jam coming through at about the ten minute mark of this jam. Developed very nicely and executed almost flawlessly. It meanders along and picks up some real steam until it morphs into a very wahwah space journey that lasts only for a few minutes as this is part of the journey, not a stop. Hints of tiger abound, this could only be taking us to one destination that is, Dark Star. With Phil playing the first few notes, the beast takes a moment to stop and look around, but not for long as outer space is not the destination for this one. Played in perfect time, this truncated version of Dark Star has all the makings of a piece of history. Just as quickly as they arrive to the depths of space, they are leaving in the comfort of Sing Me Back Home. This one looks out of place on paper but don\u2019t let that fool you. Just Jerry and few thousand of his closest friends right here being comforted by the wholesome sound of the band. Perfect way to slow it down before the afterburner kicks in with the start of SugarMags. Jerry once again grabs this one by the throat with his soloing and rock star Bobby is in full effect mode. This show concludes with all three heads of this beast swinging wildly and breathing lightning all over the crowd. The finish this one off with a smoking JBG with Keith absolutely crushing this one. Wound nicely and finished off with a bang. Holy shit and the show is over and I am in awe. \n\nI was able to listen to this 31 song bowhemouth twice during this long weekend, and man am I glad I did. I am giving this show my very highest recommendation, which makes it the thirteenth installment of the DDP series. Must Have, Must Listen. No other way to describe this one\u2026.Well, unless you like my description which is a genetically mutated, lightning breathing three headed dragon from outer space that is capable of interplanetary travel\u2026.Peace",

      "review_text": "Another gem from The Spectrum This show seems to have garnered a bit of the attention that it so deserves.  The second set He's gone->Truckin'->Jam->Philo Stomp*->Spanish Jam->Space->Dark Star->Sing Me Back Home segue begs for your attention! Some might observe the criminally short DS and thereby dismiss this show.  That would be a fool's errand, folks! The aforementioned suite accounts for a solid hour of sweet ear candy.  This clean SBD picks up on the enthusiastic crowd at times, and hints at the joyous moments they were undoubtedly experiencing. \n\nAs aforementioned, the DS clocks in at only four minutes (the only shorter version that I know of is the actual studio single, released in April of 1968, and clocking in at 2:44). But again, the monster jam(s) leading up to the DS are worth the price of admission alone.\n\nThe first set of this night offers great renditions of many classics, including Box of Rain, They Love Each Other, and Loser.  The Playin' to close the first set is, as expected, of interest.  \n\nI used to be under the impression that the corn-belt tour of February \u201973 couldn't be topped, but this show, and the one two days before in Utica give those great February shows a decent run for the money.  Of course, later comes the great months of October, November & December.  But those are reviews for another time\u2026\n\nOne thing I've come to realize over the years is that virtually every show where the boys played The Spectrum deserves respect!\n\n\n* I wouldn\u2019t necessarily peg this jam segment as a true \u201cPhilo Stomp\", but I labeled it as such since Phil & Billy display that conversational interplay sometimes known from the Fall of \u201972, and carrying over into various shows drizzled throughout \u201973 (found into, out of, or during  Dark Star or The Other One).  Three examples of a true Philo Stomp can be found in the Dark Stars of 10/18/72 & 11/13/72, and The Other One of 10/24/72.",

      "review_text": "Amusing Memory Ahhh the Spectrum we loathed the acoustics but the band always put on great shows throughout the seventies. I don't know how some people remember minute details from a 40+ year old show. I remember walking out exhausted and drained a feeling of contented euphoria a common side affect of a 70\"s show. A 2ND LISTEN confirms those feelings. Anyway here is my amusing memory-Their we're 4 or 5 of us I loaded my treasured brass pipe(an antique of 2 years, very old for those days) I passed the duchie to the left but it never came back. Upon investigation my magnanimous unthinking friend passed it on to left. Anyway after a few choice words I pulled out my zigzags and went back to enjoying the show. As God is my witness 4 hours latter I was tapped on the right shoulder their was my pipe fully loaded no less. If you know the Spectrum you could not conceive of the impossibility of my bowl making a circuit of the entire arena-ONLY AT A GRATEFUL DEAD SHOW!\nP.S.Left the pipe on the roof of the car in the parking lot after the show it slid off somewhere on Broad street all that's left are the memories.",

      "review_text": "Easter weekend at the Spectrum, '73 Who remembers the stage set-up for this show? I recall it looked much larger, and sounded better than anything I've seen before this. It looked like a Wall proto- type, with tall towers of speakers, tie-dye covers, clarity of sound, really impressive. And it had glitches; when they started, after about 20 minutes of noodling, \"Bertha\" kicks off the show, for about 2 minutes, then PFFFFT! So, they stop, and Bobby steps up to apologize, saying, \"Sorry, something's not right, and we want everything to be perfect, so we're gonna fix what's broke, and start over...\" This happens 2 more times, same thing about being perfect, ect... then kicks off again, and they don't stop except for a set break until, like 4 hours later!. It was so long, I almost dozed off during \"Space\", what with the air so filled with smoke, I got contact-high! First Dead show for me, as I lived out in N Montg, County, Red Hill, and going to the \"City\" was kinda far, we usually went to Allentown Fairgrounds for shows. But this was different: couldn't talk my buddies into going, so I went alone. On the drive home, I wonder, why did I go so far , for country/ western music, and that lo-o-ong 2nd set, Geez, what was that!? Years later, when bootleg CD's started coming in from Holland and Germany, I bought a copy of this very show, and I love it, would give my left nut to go back to that show, and do it right...if only!! Oh well, I was told once, you don't really  \"get\" your 1st show, but then after that, you're hooked, and so it is, and was, and shall be, Long live the Grateful Dead!!",

      "review_text": "Free-form flowin' fun One of the standouts of early 73.  Jerry is in fine form on his ax, as the band treats Playin' as a tapestry of sound color, winding up in an exquisitely tender stretch which leads with an elegant crescendo into the reprise.  The real jamming meat of the show, however, begins at the end of the vocal portion of He's Gone.  Jerry jumps into the jam with gusto, and his inspired playing leads nicely into a hot Truckin', but it is the free-form jam after Truckin' that wows.  Coming out of a lull in the action, Bob plays a simple, one-chord rhythm pattern.  The band join with him, and we're off and running in a jam that seems to come out of nowhere.  Eventually this settles into a faster than usual Spanish jam.  By the time Dark Star finally arrives, they're all jammed out, so this could be considered a backwards Dark Star in a sense.",

There were a bunch of guitar strings from Bob and Jerry, on the floor in front of us, as they changed strings on their guitars. Kept those as a memento for years. I had several Dead albums already by that time, so knew most songs, but was floored by the extended Playin'. I remember this show to this day. Saw 4 others in '73, RFK and Fall Spectrum. Such a great show, I'd put this up a best show I ever saw along with 6/10/73.",

For my ears they are perfect renditions. Typical but I've heard people speak of 1973 and starting around this time the Band started really digging their toes into the sand. Personally I love the arrangement they have with Billy on the kit. With Mickey the sound can go much farther but this sound they have here is so direct. It punches all the way until the end, leaving you wanting more. \n\nAlso a note, that this is Daves Picks 32 for any interested. The soundboard is so clean though. Mastered perfectly, not to mention the recording job is stellar. Love how its mixed. Bobby on the left side, with Jerry on the right. Billy and Keith overlaid onto one another. And Phil rounding the bases. It's a perfect arrangement. I do love Matrix recordings. But you can't help closing your eyes with recordings like 32 and think, this is what it was like. \n\nLong live the Grateful Dead. ",
