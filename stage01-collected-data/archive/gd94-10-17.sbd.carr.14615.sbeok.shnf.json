It was definitively the fastest Eyes played in the 90s.The Eyes sounds like a race between Jerry, Bob, and the boys in the back to get to the end of 25 minutes first. The only thing really crisp about the Eyes is Jerry enunciating the lyrics.  \n\nThis show was pretty tight in the first, but became very sloppy in the start of the second. They never really get in sync in the 2nd until Watchtower- where Bob's enunciating like Dylan-and Jerry belts out a nice Morning Dew. Dylan was definitely a treat to end a sub par second set effort.\n\nMusically, they never caught the aspirations of the set list.",

The second set eyes is long but for a reason. in the begining of eyes jerry breaks a string and parrish was out there for a while working on replacing it. jerry being the master jamed on 5 strings keeping eyes going untill the string was set and jerry could finish the song. anyone getting upset at the lack of jamming during eyes didnt notince what was going on onstage. i was told before the show by a friend that he was in the hotel bar where bobby was having his B day party and knowing dylan was in town weir wanted dylan to come and sit in with the dead on the 17 or 18. at first i was not buying it, but know dylan was in town for a few nights. lo and behold, even though his mic was off for most of rainy day women, it was fun to be there and the whole crowd was singing along on the chorus. the rest of the show is well played. i had a tape of this show and it was very muddy, this CD copy sounds a lot better and i'm happy with this quality. get it. you wont be sorry",

This was my last Dead show ever (after 50+) and was the best post 1991 show I saw (and believe me, I sat through many an east coast meatball from 92-95). I was first row in front of Phil this night and even got backstage between sets, where Phil was real social, chatting with fans about upcoming live releases.  \n\nThe strength of this show is the entire second set.  High energy, lots of emotion, and strong song selection (no new tunes). Opened with a super sweet, 25-minute Eyes with Mickey on congas and closed with an incredibly heart-felt Morning Dew which builds from a pin drop to a furious ending.\n\nBob Dylan came out for the encore (Rainy Day Women) which totally blew the mind of me and everyone in the Garden that night.  The lyrics are a bit low in the mix, however.\n\nFond memories for me and perhaps enjoyment for you!",

      "review_text": "Nice one This show has a lot of character.  The first set opens with Midnight Hour, a nice surprise -- not too long or flashy, but good fun as Bobby does his best Pigpen impression.  The rest of the first set is pretty standard, featuring a solid Peggy-O and a high-energy Minglewood.  The second set is very strong for the era.  Almost every song is well played (I say \"almost\" because I thought Morning Dew was a bit subpar, both instrumentally and lyrically).  Eyes is wonderfully long and Estimated is jammed out nicely, but the real highlight of the second set is the awesome Watchtower.  It's not very long, but Jerry's guitar is fierce all the way through, the chords are powerful and Bobby's vocals are on fire.  Just listen to him snarling \"There are many here among us....\"; not that it's such a big deal how he sings it, but you can tell the band is excited to be playing this with Dylan listening from backstage.  Then came the unfortunate Dew let-down, which I mentioned, and then the Rainy Day Women encore, which is great fun (even though Dylan's voice is barely audible and, truth be told, the band is pretty uneven); you gotta love hearing the crowd singing the refrain (even though most of them were probably coming down at that point, eh?)  This is a high quality SBD and a highly recommended show overall.",

You could here a pin drop during the middle part of Dew. The dynamics were awesome! They really mastered the sound in the Garden. It was like the music was in your head and not coming from the direction of the stage. Great Space too. This show was a reflection of the long strange trip. I swear Jerry was shedding a tear during Dew, just listen to the middle part before the eruption. Play it loud. The whole place had chills from that dew. I remember looking around after seeing people crying, i was too, the sound was awesome, crystal clear, listen to an audience recording of this show. Jerry wails on watchtower! It was a magic night. What makes parts of this show sound clunky are the drums. they are off in the mix. But i dont recall the drums issue live, just on the soundboard mix. The next night was dissapointing, lacking magic. Strange how the Dead could tap in one night and not the next. This night they were tapped in all night. Rare Heartfelt night. 5 Big Apples for this one!",

      "review_text": "A very potent Morning Dew on a spooky night I have friends who saw the Dead from the 60's on.  And across the board, they all favored Dead shows that exhibited \"weirdness.\"  Well, this show from the Fall '94 run at Madison Square Garden had a very distinct, slightly malevolent vibe throughout the night that stands completely apart from the other four shows I saw of that run.  (I missed the Saturday night show, unfortunately; don't recall why).  Anyway, this show was damn strong, except for an inexplicably sloppy Friend of the Devil (with Jerry flubbing some lyrics).  The second set Eyes of the World, once it got running (after Jerry replaced his broken string), charged ahead very forecfully.  And give a good listen to Jerry on Morning Dew.  He belts the vocals very powerfully, and it's his soloing that drives the band to a second crescendo at the end of the song.  Possibly Dylan's presence backstage accounts for the night's unusual vibe, but it was a \"weird\" evening from start to finish.  And by the way, the Dylan encore was incredibly disappointing in one sense-- with Dylan's microphone not working.  But the whole crowd slowly caught on to the song, and gleefully sang the \"Everybody must get stoned\" refrain-- which was fun.  A very interesting show from '94.",

When the crowd piped in for the \"Everybody must get stoned\" refrain it was really pretty funny and served to release some of that weird tension in the air.\n\nOne other noteworthy thing about this night, and many who were there will probably remember this to some degree.  I filed out of this show into an Irish sports bar across 7th avenue, and happened upon the 4th quarter of what was arguably the best Monday Night Football game of all time - the Broncos/Chiefs - Elway vs Montana game (it won the vote as the best a couple of years ago, even).  It was a really strong Dead show, and an absolutely effing awesome MNF game - all in all a truly superb evening.",
