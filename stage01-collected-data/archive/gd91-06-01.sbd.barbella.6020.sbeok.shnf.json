The only time they played the LA Coliseum, and the contrast between the neighborhood and the heads was pretty fascinating.\n\nFirst set Shakedown opener seemed to go on FOREVER at the time, and it was partially because heads were storming the reserved seating floor. They literally overwhelmed security and it was a little ugly for a few minutes before security gave up. \n\nSweet licks on Candyman, standard Deal.\n\nSecond set pleased this uninitiated fan, because I was familiar with so much of the material. The Playing jam isn't bad, but the rest is played pretty straightforward. Nothing's botched too terribly, but nothing really stands out. I don't think the band was impressed with their environment, and this show gets overlooked by most people. Still, it'll always have a special place in my heart because it was first exposure to the magic live.",

      "review_text": "incredible sound quality - Strange dichotomy/vibes at show I was at this show, it was my first full show, I had caught the second set at the previous cal expo show and was stuck in the lot in Feb in Oakland - but this was my first real show and my first \"dosed to the gills\" show, so this one was interesting in a lot of ways for me. \n\nThe playing was very good for 91, but there were some very strange vibes at this show, so first I'll speak to the stuff surrounding the show and my story and then will get to the music. \n\nSo a bunch of us drove to the LA Colliseum from Lancaster CA. We parked on MLK and walked into the lot. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was the heavy law enforcement presence compared to what I had seen at Cal Expo.. The lot scene was small, controlled and, comparatively paranoid in a way I wasn't used to... In addition to the visible LE presence, according to the people we talked to there were a lot of undercovers as well. We still scored multiple sheets and some very good bud, though not as easily as up north. Also purchased some delicious homemade food and clothing. Unfortunately my gf at the time decided the blotter was weak and shoved three more in my mouth unsolicited... She was wrong about it being weak, it was clean and strong, and it was alright in the end, it just made for an intense afternoon. \n\nAs we were getting ready to go in we got stamped with bear stamps on our wrists by people, and noticed a GIANT trash can at the security gate checkpoint that seemed to be filled with bags of weed, N02 balloons and various paraphernalia, food and other stuff that clearly belonged to people who shouldn't have lost it.  that was being confiscated. MY lady put our stuff in her bra and underwear and no issues there.\n\nAs the show started it was hot and we were in the mezzanine section, so not on the floor. Not all of the cops were bad, but the ones who were doing security inside were quite harsh. The guys went into Shakedown, and It's a damn good 91 version because they're feeding off of the strange energy and cops and the behavior of some who were rushing to get to the floor. People keep talking about a riot during shakedown. There wasn't a riot, this was a bunch of people trying to get past a barrier onto the floor - which inspired a few groups of others in the stands to try to move up - because the stadium was undersold (it's a BIG place). Nonetheless, the cops and security were kind of harsh, and it ALL fed into a long Shakedown....Bill Graham later got on the mic and mentioned the fire marshal and people eventually chilled. .\n\nThere are some great moments.  The digital soundboard recording sounds amazing, better than it did that day due to the acoustics of that huge stone space..\n\nIve already mentioned the Shakedown. The Bertha is a pretty damn good 91 version as well...\"deal\" is fantastic and jammy, loved the Foolish Heart, and the interaction on PITB before it segues into UJB is jazzilicious.\n\nDrums and space were typical, someone threw a bag of weed into the air near us during a high point on \"miracle\" which was weird, as others have mentioned, the live mix was weird. I always assumed it was sue to my psychedlicized state, but Ive read other reviews that mention the swirling of the live sound... This recording sounds better than it did that day.  \n\nI had always loved the atmosphere at dead shows and though this one had some bad cop energy at times it was still magical for me - and I am eternally grateful to this site, to the uploader and all involved in procuring, processing and bringing this the great source tape to the masses, thank you Archive.org also for this phenomenal site that's been a mainstay all of us deadheads for around 20 years now.",

I went to Carson in 90, and my dad wouldnt let me go to Vegas in early 1991 with my buddies... likely due to the huge pupils I had when i came home from Carson.  I was 17 at the time, and to go to this show I had to fib and say i was going to Disneyland with my girlfriend.\n\nIt was hot, and there was a ton of paper floating around in the lot, and we indulged perhaps a wee bit on the too much side.  Girlfriend, her friend and I nearly loose our marbles listening to the recording as you neared the gate to get in... \"No bottles.... No cans.... No druuuuuuuggssss... No Beeeeeeach balllssss....\" Melting in a big way, and it was an hour before the show.\n\nOnce inside we checked out the opening band, Johnny Clegg and Savuka... then came the dead.  \n\nSheer intensity in the big city.  Most of the people in the stands worked there way down to the floor, and breached the seemingly impenetrable security forces.  Re-enforcments arrived (read: LAPD) and it got fairly testy.  I sat in my seat laughing my ass off... the band seemed to be, almost on an ESP level, telling the fans to come on down...  I gave it a try, but these guys seriously looked like they were gonna kill someone.\n\n...Security was not amused, nor were they about to let a bunch of skinny hippies get onto the floor.  They put up a helluva fight.  One big mean blue shirt grabbed a beach ball and destroyed it with his teeth!!!!  It eventually calmed down, but for a while it was fairly intense.  Bill Graham spoke at the break and threeatened to stop the show if the weirdness continued.\n\nThe music was swirly all day long.  Seemed to come out of one side of the stadium and work its way across the field back into the other stack... to be regeneraated into the next trippy sound to be sent out into the cosmos.  It was like the audio version of the wave.\n\nThey never came back to the Coliseum...  probably not a bad idea.  In fact, they didnt come closer than Vegas to LA for several years after this 'event'\n\nI have heard pure trash talked about this show since the day it happened, but the tapes sure say different.  While not a GREAT show, it isnt trash, and is fairly tightly played... and extremely well recorded.\n\nWhen i got home, still flying as high as the Eiffel Tower, my dad was in the hall to great me with the news that the mom of my girlfriend had called wondering when we were coming home from the dead show... Doh!  busted, yet again.  This would not be the first time my infatuation with this pack of freaks got me into hot water with the pops.",

If the sound were great all of the heads wouldn't have flooded the floors thus creating mass panic and a security nightmare. \n\nAnd no GA for a 100,000 seater.

And in the midst of it all, the Dead were like the Pied Piper of Hamlin - the more people poured onto the field, the more intense the played; and the more intense they played, the more people flooded onto the field.  Most fascinating, in a slightly scary kind of way.  Songwise, most of the first set was very good, and the pre-drums in the second was really solid - best Picasso I've ever seen, in fact.

Soundtrack to a riot!\n\nI didn't see any reviewer mention Rodney King, so I will. The video of King's beating by the LAPD had just been released in March, and that whole thing was hanging over everything in La-La Land, and the whole USA. The beginning of the video age, as it were.  \n\nLike crayZfingers, our merry band had driven all night from Phoenix, arriving in Los Angeles shortly after sun-up. I pulled the last couple hours behind the wheel of our buddy's 90-foot-long '70s-era Cadillac after serving as a pretty dubious designated shotgun rider through to 29 Palms or Indio, and I remember getting my first queasy feeling in the city on the 10 when I drove down some seen-it-before-in-the-movies dip under a pedestrian bridge/building overpass, just as AC/DC's \"Back in Black\" started on the car radio I'd flipped on to tune (back) into reality. Not knowing jack about LA, I just stayed on the 10 'til we hit the Pacific Ocean. Almost literally. \n\nAfter a restless hour of trying to sleep on the beach (nyun-nyun-nyun-nyun), we reloaded and headed south on the 405 and came east on what turned out to be Slausen, made (in)famous by King-related police radio chatter recordings, and we stopped mid-way through South-Central to pick up snacks and beers.  We were the only whites in sight, and I remember a couple of quick \"Hi's\" and a lot of wordless eye contact with other shoppers and store employees-- shared, knowing looks and acknowledging nods, as in, it's cool, we're all on the same side, especially now, especially 'round here.  We pushed on to the Coliseum feeling both sad about the locals' cop reality and strangely exhilarated by the stop.\n\nMore props to crayZfingers, indeed, not all the LA cops were bad.  At least outside the venue, where one cool young officer gave the guy ahead of me a chance, and a choice, after finding a baggie of gorgeous, jumbo 'shroom blooms sitting carefully atop the rest of the guy's fanny pack contents.  The cop laughed, and told the dude he was welcome to return to the parking lot with his stuff and think things over before trying to go into the show.  The guy apparently thought he was still at the April Vegas shows, where security had imposed a two-doob minimum at the gate--gonna be a long day, kids-- and in any case he panicked here in LA, and chose door number lose-your-treats.  He lurched toward the ticket-takers, and the cop just shook his head and laughed and grabbed the 'shrooms as the guy went by, tossing them in the contraband barrel and leaving him free to 'wharf' the show.\n\nInside was a much different story, cop-wise.  We were Jerry side, 2/3 the way up the stadium, just past 2 o'clock on the seating dial, and there were pairs of cops near every entryway.  Smug, arrogant, Hollywood, Eric Estrada/\"CHIPS\" wannabes, with tailored unis, razor cuts, designer shades, and attitude.  So many cops...it looked like a rock show in the old USSR or North Korea, like the authorities expected some violent types instead of Deadheads.  Well, they got (provoked) what they expected.  \"Shakedown\" was an incredible sight and sound (yay Bruce), watching the sea of humanity go over the partially-collapsed chain-link fence to the floor, about four/five o'clock on the seating dial, while security, maybe trying to impress the cops, literally threw people back over the fence and otherwise whomped on them while the band jammed.  You'd look back at the stage, and Jerry and the gang were all watching the riot, too, and playing to/off it.  I swear Jerry did some extra \"just gotta poke arounds\" to encourage the kids to make it to the promised land.  It was an incredible moment in GD time. Best viewed from the safety of the stands.\n\nThe band continued the theme, Bob with \"Walkin' (over the fence) Blues\", and Jerry with (throw me in the jailhouse) \"Bertha\" -- great version. And, as soon as \"Candyman\" started, people were jazzed and howling, and, with apologies to ulikunkel, those were virtual shotguns our part of the stadium pointed and mock-fired at officers unfriendly during the \"Mr. Benson\" verse.  A measure of virtual revenge.  And a sweet version, too.\n\nLike Desdave, OthrOne, and Bruce M, I remember all too well the obese, psychotic guard with baby blue \"SECURITY\" shirt stretched to the limit, who attacked and tackled beach ball after beach ball with teeth, knife, gusto, anything he could muster. That guy was a scary and ridiculous piece of work.  Like Joe Jackson sang, if looks (and vibes) could kill, there was a man there who was marked down as dead. He got \"Candymanned\" thousands of times over.\n\nThe show never really recovered after all the mayhem, or rather, I found it hard to focus/get the good vibes going.  It was cool seeing Bill Graham take the stage and mic--but not to have him lecture us like a high school vice-principal about the Fire Marshal, given that the riot blame could be laid fairly at not only the kids' and over-reacting security's feet, but at BGP's as well, for not making the show General Admission.  BGP sold maybe 35K tix in a 90K seat venue, and the grand canyon of open space and empty seats on the floor just cried out to be filled, especially since the cheap PA set-up meant crappy sound on the sides. \nIn any case the weather was SoCal pleasant and I had some fun with the swaying palm trees and ragged, melting California Bear flag along the way.  The cherry on this sour Saturday sundae, though, was the band closing the 2nd set with NFA, meaning there would be no drama about the encore (here comes OMSN) and we felt like we basically got shorted one song.  By that point our group of played-out vagabonds had wandered all the way to the top at the back-most part of the Coliseum, dead-center 6 o'clock on the dial, standing on the wall, leaning back against the slightly sagging chain-link fence, taking it all in, the show scene, and the city of angels.  Bob would make the OMSN diss up to us in grand-- GRAND! style on 12-28-91, but we couldn't know that yet, as the sun set and we bummed.\n\nSo thank F-in G for Steve Barbella, John Valter, Paul Bottiglio, and Internet Archive, for preserving and making available such a great recording of this show, which contains so much great playing.  It reminds me of the GD Movie scene where Jerry talks about a time he thought the music was F-ed and pushed Phil down a little flight of stairs after a gig, only to hear the show tapes later and discover the music was crackling hot. The day in L.A. may have mainly sucked and been full of weirdness, but the music is sweet and we'll have it forever to go along with our mixed bag of memories.  Just gotta poke around.\n\nFive stars because it's still a free country (Thanks, Obama!) and for a killer Shakedown and lots of great Jerry.  Like Rex in TS2, I don't need to play it -- I've lived it!  But I play it often, 'cause it's so sweet.  Got the jamming \"Deal\" rave-up crankin' right now.  \n\nJERRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!",

Glad I wasn't looking for anything, cause, even sober, with the ever present security everywhere; I was paranoid even when doing nothing illegal.\n\nThe show itself sucked. When I saw the fans break down the literal walls onto the field, it wasn't, like fuck yeah, it was like, I swear to god there's gonna be a riot. Foreshadowing. Hell, the show was within blocks of the start of the riots, right in the epicenter of South Central.\n\nFor some strange reason, I remember liking Picasso Moon. Yep. Fucking strange day.\n\n(Okay, just at least listen to the jam at the end of Picasso Moon, after the lyrical part. It sounds great).",

Vince(RIP)seems too loud for the amount that they are letting him play...he's playing way too much for that volume. Bruce is laying back more which I think works better. Phil is outstanding on Playing/UJ. Thanks to all who contribute to making such nice recordings available to the public.",

Heads in tie-dies running barefoot down the freeway between the cars. Scored some strong acid in the parking lot. Was seated on the field near the back. First set a massive crowd starts descending from the stands heading for the field. Everyone in the field seats is mesmerized. Security on the field rushes by to stop the onslaught from the stands. When the last security passes me, I rush for the stage and make it within 20 feet of Bruce Hornsby's piano. The statue of Jesus on his piano painted in tie-die colors sticks with me to this day.",

      "review_text": "'Here he comes and he's gone again' Wow !! Thank you to all the reviews. I love reading each and everyone of them while listening as it really gives you a different perspective than just streaming. First I want to say the sound quality here is just top notch A+! I know what people below are saying about '72 but man there's a few nice jams on this one. Some people will forever think such an such a year was the best, but each show had it's own mystique. Some shows with Janis, some with the Allman's, some with Dylan, and even some with Hornsby, the Dead were like no other. Summer shows are almost always spirited events, and this one is no different.      \n Shakedown has a great bounce to it. Super opener Walking showcasing some fantastic Bruce. Man, I wish Hornsby had just committed to full time and been the permanent choice. He is one hell of a player. Bertha is tight, and GSET is well played as well. Sometimes with a little distance and a fresh ear, the music is heard for what it was. Seems more than a few people reviewing were there and had a negative experience. Understood. 1991 in L.A. was a strange time. From my vantage 25 years later and not being there, this sounds grate! Not 5 star '69, but tight none the less. Nice QJ and seriously, that Deal is just fun.         \n Picasso Moon breaks out in the 2nd set nicely to Foolish Heart. Playin > UJB is also tight with some wonderful keys. Super tasty jams all around. Not sure how anyone could rate this only one star? D > S Miracle & Peter are all grate as well. Throwing Stones into NFA make a strong finish. Well played. The encore isn't a slouch either.                     \n The boys are not in their 20's here. Pushing 50, they sound a little older and wiser than '72. Give it a fresh ear and it may put a smile on your face. I'm giving this four stars for a little balance. It's a 4 star effort and 5 star sound quality. Thank you to everyone involved in taping, preserving, and uploading.    \n\nHappy 50th Grateful Dead !",

      "review_text": "Where does the time go? Wow... 25 years ago today. Seems like it was yesterday.  I remember this show well and I think it has stood the test of time.  It has a rep as a bad show, and I wasn't too stoked with it at the time.  I just blew it off as another mediocre dead show with a few obvious exceptions (one of my favorite shakedowns).  I think the bad rep comes from people who were there and had to deal with all the crap that happened inside that day and the terrible sound.  But listening to a SBD years later, I think this is one of the better shows of that era.\n\nI won't rehash all the stuff that's already been posted, just give my story...\n\nI lived in socal at the time and most of my deadhead friends were up in the bay area and didn't want to travel down for this show.  I almost didn't go but a few days before the show I asked a guy I was working with at the time if he wanted to go.  He hadn't seen the dead in 10 years (he was 12 years older than me and a \"70's head\" which was before my time) and he wanted to go but couldn't afford a ticket.  i offered to buy him one and he was cool with that.  i had seen the vegas shows in April and told him how good they were, so he really wanted to go. He was a hardcore vegan and I was slowly becoming a vegetarian, so he offered to make us a vegan lunch in exchange for the ticket.  He used to be a personal chef for Michael Jackson so you can imagine how good that lunch was! \n\nWe left early not knowing what traffic would be like, and coming up from OC we hit no traffic until the offramp.  Didn't see any heads running around on the freeway but we sure did on the streets.  The lot scene was almost non existent, which was unusual. A heavy cop presence kept everything mellow.  we were hoping to kill time in the lot while the opening band was on, but we ended up going in early because there' wasn't much going on outside.  We were low in the stands, phil side, about 8 or 9 o'clock from the stage. Only thing I remember about the opening band was the dancers.\n\nI think the show started late and the heads were getting a little pissed, but the shakedown was a killer.  Bertha rocked too and pretty much the whole first set, except for Walkin Blues, which I don't like under any circumstances. and the Deal to close it out was a rocker.  \n\nAfter a longer than normal break, I was praying for a China-> Rider to open the 2nd set but got a Picasso Moon instead.  Oh well, but at least its one of the the better ones you'll hear. \n\nOther than the much appreciated UJB and Black Peter (I was REALLY into Workingmans Dead at this time) the 2nd set was pretty standard late 80's early 90's stuff, but done well.  Cops cleared the lots quickly so no hanging out after the show.  \n\nI look back on this show with alot of good memories.  One I remember was the girls sitting behind us.  Typical cute blissed out hippie chicks that you saw at shows back then.  Somewhere during the first set one of them tapped me on the back.  I turned around and she bent over and told me what a great dancer I was and that she was watching me more than the band.  I never paid too much attention to my dancing.  I just did what i did and whatever, but I thought that was nice of her to say.\n\nNot the best show, but like I said, better than a lot of people remember IMO.  Thank you Jerry, for everything.  My life was much better back then with the Dead in it.",

Me, my brother and our father attended this event. As with anyone's first show, it was like a colorful, vivid dream.(the huge mushroom cap a fellow dead head gave me in the men's room also helped) music was great, saw a lot of good people having a blast. But the one thing I will always remember was the fat, greasy security guard that caught the giant beach ball and popped it with his teeth. He was then pelted with marshmallows and then had a lemon icy thrown at him. One of the best laughs I will take to my grave!!!",

      "review_text": "The Scene Was Mean The scene was mean at the Coliseum 29 years ago today. There was a weird vibe in the air. Security and Police were aggressive. Heads were being heads so there was some tension in the air.\nI showed up with no real intention of hanging out before or after the show. I drove from Tucson with my younger brother. His first show. Ugh. He saw the boys at Pine Knob with me later in June. Our hometown shows. A much better scene. A real Dead scene.\nThe Shakedown was good once the band got settled in and Healy dialed in the sound. The crowd busting on to the floor was a crazy sight. Thousands of Heads pushing their way against dozens of Security goons. Bertha->Greatest in the 3rd & 4th slot was a pleasant surprise. Deal rocked out some.\nOverall, the 1st Set isn't that bad. It was pretty good \"to the ear\" at the show but much better on tape when you can actually listen to the music and not see all the shit that was going on before, during, and after the gig itself. If this Set was played at a different venue, say Cal Expo, it would've been a lot better reviewed.\nThe 2nd had it's moments. I remember it didn't do much for me in person but plays better listening to it after the fact. I think a lot of negative criticism of this show was more about the scene than the music itself. It wasn't the greatest but wasn't the worst.  3* Music\n1* Scene & Vibe",

      "review_text": "LA Dead.   This was a great show for me.  Somehow we got staff parking and we were milling about when Bruce showed up at the fence and we started chatting.  We were joking and laughing when I said, \"hey Bruce, how about a Shakedown opener?\" He said, \"Hey man, we figure out all that stuff just before going on.\" I just wanted to plant the seed.  And what do you know.......Shakedown opener!! I also remember having pretty good seats, lots of LAPD officers about.  I have a striking memory of looking up at the stadium seats above stage right and seeing an LAPD officer in uniform.  The sun was reflecting off his badge like some kind of superhero.  It was a quite striking......\n  Now I have to verify with my friend, but I seem to recall my friends brother aka \"the Grateful Dork\", brought his friend and his girlfriend to the show.  They were not heads at all, but it was local and they had great seats and backstage passes as well.  Apparently, when they were back there the guys girlfriend and Bill Walton got to talking.  They ended up getting married.  Far Out.  \n  You know, I was lucky to see lots of shows, and of course we would critique them and complain about this and that, but now I relish in all these memories a lifetime ago.  Don't forget to donate to the Archive and keep all of these memories alive!",
