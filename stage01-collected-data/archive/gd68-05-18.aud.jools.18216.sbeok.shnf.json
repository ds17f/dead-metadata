The absolutely mind-bending Drums (with Pigpen screaming and bashing his organ keys)is worth the price alone, as well as Bobby's profane rant after Feedback. \"Fuck the proletariat!\" he shouts over and over. \nAnyway, this show I think is a lost Dead gem among tape collectors. Yes the sound quality is grungy and rough, but it's actually better than 6/14/68. This may not have the unique setlist that show had, but this performance could easily match that show. As presented on this archive, however, I think this show is under-represented. There was two AUD tapes for this show, why not make a composite of them for this seeding, or at least attempt a clean-up? The sound could be improved somewhat. Just goes to show how ignored this little nugget is in GD history. Use it as filler; it's well worth the 35+ minutes of disc space.",

The Alligator>Drums>Jam>Alligator reprise is the best rendition I've ever heard.  To think that Jorma had to get some of what they were doing down for his own interest speaks volumes as to where they were at in the Spring/Summer of '68.  As with most AUDs, some of the \"air\" in the recording can be attenuated by dropping the 8K level in the EQ.  Or as Phil would say, \"drop the level at 8000 cycles please, Bear\".  Enjoy.",

If you like the Anthem-of-the-Sun-era shows, you\u2019ll find this to be a hot one.\n\nThe \u201cMountain Jam\u201d riff was common in this period -- it\u2019s on Anthem of the Sun. \n\nThe set ends in dynamite feedback, gradually subsiding to a single tap of the cymbal.\n\nAs for the recording, you can barely hear Pigpen\u2019s vocal. There\u2019s also clipping (distortion). Fortunately, there\u2019s another, somewhat better recording here:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-05-18.aud.dad.82515.flac16",

It was an incredible show and this May session reminds me a lot of it. My favorites are definitely the Spring 1968 shows when they peaked with this set list before Dark Star, St Stephen etc reset the performance list. I keep telling myself that maybe the 1968 Mystery Tapes are mislabled and are actually the spring East Coast tour because they certainly sound like what I hear in Miami. Whether they are or not, this performance and the Mystery Tapes get me close enough to reliving the Miami shows. The quality of the recording is irrelevant. The essence is there.",
