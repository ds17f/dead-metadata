I agree with the other reviewers 100%.  The whole show just kicks ass!  Sound is tip top.  Music is as good as it gets.

God bless Dick Latvala, but if he hadn't picked the 26th, a truely great one also, (but I missed it).\n     (My friend's return to Redondo Beach and report of that show is what inspired me to race up to catch the last three). This one is surely worthy of an official release! The \"One More Saturday Morning\", after midnight from a Friday Night, the 2nd encore, was a roaring version, is just as intense as the rest of this after \"Casey Jones\", even better than San Diego 1979/11/24 and up to par with the entire rest of this absolutely amazing concert!\n     This isn't important but, when I was looking at them through my binoculars during \"Casey Jones\", I could see superimposed upon the band as if it were on T.v., the sign \"Grateful Dead\" which they brought out during that tune above them, the same one in \"the movie\"! But when I took down my binoculars it was normal i.e. not superimposed over the band but over head! Honest to God, a very wierd mushroom halucination that I could see interchangably only through my binoculars!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

This even has a good Row Jimmy...and I hate Row Jimmy. Normally, I wouldn't write a review for a show I hadn't completely listened to, however, in this case I'll make an exception. Sugaree. Yeah! Also, the Mexicali is about the best \"non-vintage\" version I've heard. All Over Now is really fast and on the money. High Time is beautiful and Music starts off great and goes on from there. I can't wait to hear Terrapin! I thought the 30th was the pinnacle(at least I was at that one)but this might be better. Without hesitation, download this show. Got to give it a 5 for execution AND sound. Thanks to those involved.",

If you're listening with headphones beware the \"crackling\" at 4:10 of Sugaree. The previously mentioned high pitched whine seems to come in at 8:05 of It's All Over Now. It sounds like 2 different recordings were spliced at that point, and the distractiing noise starts and last through the rest of disc 1. It reappers a few times on disc 2 during quiet segments. Still a very worthy download.\nThanks archive!",

All other reviews are accurate. Sorry Jerseyguy, you are right that people should relate their experiences...its just that some I read go a little to far, but if it means something to someone, then its cool. Guess I took my younger days for granted. I was lucky to see the Dead 175 times between 1977-1990. I wish everyone were as lucky as I...I always told people they should at least see the Dead once. Beginning in about 85-86, the crowds began to change a little in my eyes (guess I was getting older) and I saw the Dead a little less each subsequent year. This show is an excellant example of an early Brent show. I've always been partial to 79-83, but 77 and the east coast summer tour of 85 rock. Well enough of my inane ramblings. Enjoy the great shows of this website; we're lucky to enjoy music by great musicians who put the music there for the enjoyment of all instead of it's monetary potential. I'd also recommend people looking into the sugarmegs website for some good shows too.",

There's consistent playing and singing throughout what is definitely and \"on\" night for Jerry and the band. There a great first set as well as a second, with interesting extended jams in both sets. And there's a great set list, combining the best of 1979's repertoire, leaving out the worse (such as Brent's Easy to Love You).\n\nSugaree is an amazingly strong first song. No, not the best ever--there are several in 1977 (5/11, 10/9) and in '78 that come to mind--but still quite good. Jerry does some more great guitar work in Row Jimmy, not usually a guitar song. From here, every song is a great performance. A rocking All Over Now with Bob in top vocal form and notable Brent moves; A High Time with lots of feeling; The first set ends with the Music Never Stops in a jam that keeps building, like it won't stop. \n\nSecond opens with a tight Alabama. A monster Terrapin with long jams, followed by a wild Playing in the best Playing tradition. Out of Drums comes Uncle John's Band, including several extended jams of different moods. From there, the band wraps things up with not too, not three, but five end-of-show rockers. We don't think of Bertha or One More Saturday Night as a jam songs, but these rockers, too, are opportunities for Jerry and the band to let loose.",

I saw them play at 25 shows in '73, that's it. I always enjoyed Sugaree. I still think RFK Stadium, 9 June 73, is the best \"sounding\" Sugaree I ever heard. It's not the best arrangement, nor the best ever played. The Dead, with their \"Wall of Sound\" that weekend -- and the sound crew assembling it, mixing it, and getting them plugged into it -- created and produced the best overall sound fidelity experience I ever heard coming out of a PA System, period. I heard my 1st Sugaree show-opener version from Anchorage, 21 June 80 sbd. I was hooked after that.\n\nI searched the LMA for awhile last night, looking for Sugaree show-openers. I'm understanding that these highly-prized, special gems are the only ones they did in this touching, extended version arrangement, as done here in this show. I found about 10 of them, between '76 and '83, available now, here on the LMA. The shows that followed them, listed below, were excellent and timeless.\n\nI think this concert is in the top-250, all-time. It's All Over Now is nailed. The Music Never Stopped is stoked. Uncle John's Band sparkles. As far as this Sugaree goes, I can't find one better played than this one. You interested too? You decide. I can't make up my mind. Nor am I confused. No, it's not the 420, either.\n\ntop Sugaree show-openers for me, available now on the LMA:\n\nSugaree here in Oakland, and one from Winterland in '78 are creative. For Winterland:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd78-10-18.sbd.shakedown.298.sbeok.shnf\n\nSugaree in Lake Placid in '83 is the smoothest, really buttoned-down:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd83-10-17.sbd.miller.28361.sbeok.flacf\n\nSugaree in Anchorage is powerfully delivered. The only time the Dead did Alaska:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd80-06-21.sbd.clugston.8639.sbeok.shnf\n\nRFK Stadium '73 \"normal\" version of Sugaree. Great quality sound. 11th tune in the show:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd73-06-09.sbd.hollister.172.sbeok.shnf\n\n***Warning: Sugaree, and the Grateful Dead can be extremely non-hazardous, addictive, and otherwise hugely beneficial to your life, and your lifestyle. Listen with total, casual awareness at your own risk to bliss.\n\nps: a reviewer below says Mama Tried > Mexicali Blues are \"throwaway\" versions. Wrong. I'm hearing decent versions of happy music here, all revved up. Keepers for sure.\n\npps: having problems getting these streaming mp3's out of your browser's cache? to keep them for yourself? Frustrated Windows users should be using \"ZtreeWin\" file manager utility app for this. Here's the link:\nhttp://www.ztree.com/html/ztreewin.htm\n\nanyone have great SBDs of Sugaree show-openers to trade? how about good audience tapes of them? hit me up... 420bikeandhike@gmail.com",

The energy and sound of this show are truly one for the ages!  5 stars and A+++++ quality!\n\nMan, I just downloaded this soundboard yesterday, and started listening to it this morning on the way to work.  Without a doubt -- this show is off-the-hook!  Heck, Mama Tried and Mexicali Blues are as good as I've ever heard before.  I disagree with JamminJerome, who said these are throwaway versions.  No way, dude!  Every song from this concert is sic and rippin\u2019!  It\u2019s like you hit the \u201crandom\u201d button on your CD player for a Dead show, and every song smokes!  What I love about this show is that you have some songs like High Time, The Music Never Stopped, Greatest Story Ever Told, and I Need A Miracle, that aren\u2019t played on your typical Dead shows.  I know everyone talks about Sugaree being a top-three version (which it most certainly is), but I doubt you will find better versions of The Music Never Stopped (Jerry\u2019s guitar is mind-blowing) and Greatest Story Ever Told.\n\nThis may be the best Alabama Getaway I\u2019ve ever heard (sic, man!), and this was Brent\u2019s first year with the band.  For my money, I\u2019ll take Brent over Keith any day as far as playing keyboards is concerned, plus he could sing his ass off.  In fact, when Brent Mydland died on July 26th, 1990, Garcia basically never recovered from losing one of his best friends, until his own death in 1995.  If you want to hear a hot show with Brent\u2019s keyboards and Jerry\u2019s guitar rippin\u2019, check out Shakedown Street from the Merriweather Post Pavilion show in Columbia, MD, on 6-30-85.  One of my all-time favorite Shakedown Streets!\n\nFor a nice chronology of the band, visit the following link:\n\nhttp://www.classicbands.com/dead.html\n\nI love the 70s Dead, but when Brent joined the band, this band only got better after Donna and Keith were given the boot after the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum show on 02-17-1979.  When another \u2018Road Trips\u2019 volume is released for 1979, they should include songs from this late fall/early winter tour.  I\u2019ve downloaded the other 3 concerts from 12/27, 12/30, and 12/31 at the Oakland Auditorium Arena, but haven\u2019t had a chance to listen to them.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just as good!  And I\u2019m a big-time East Coast Dead fan!\n\nThe Bertha -> Good Lovin\u2019 is off-the-hook, and are certainly some of the best versions played of these two songs that I\u2019ve heard!  Bob Weir is as energetic during this entire show as he is with any other 5-star show.  I can\u2019t find anything wrong with this concert.  Moreover, it fits perfectly on 2 80-minute CD-R\u2019s.\n\nI would love to hear a review from someone that actually attended this show.  If you\u2019d like to know how to download the awesome soundboard of this show, please feel free to email me at rfkrox44@hotmail.com.\n\nPeace-out!

Sugaree starts this one off beautifully, and the tone of the Tiger is spot on. Jerry does a little slide work towards the end that probably had every dog in a ten mile radius howling from the incredible highs he achieves. Next up comes the Mama Tried>Mexicali combo. I have always said that cowboy tunes early in the first set are an excellent barometer on what kind of night Jerry will be having. After hearing this combo its obvious Jerry is shredding this evening. Both are speedy as hell and jammed out as much as they can be, with Jerry just motoring along the whole time in the background. Scales up and down nonstop. Nice job Jerome\u2026Those two wind down and fall comfortably into Row Jimmy. This one is smooth and Heavy, with great slide work again. Jerry really manages the tone well with the slidepiece. This one almost has a reggae feel with Bobby doing the upstroke sounding rhythm. All Over Now comes next and Bobby just kills this one. Great, great version right here followed by a Bee-You-teee-ful High Time. I think this is a top tier High Time, classic storytelling by Garcia. TMNS comes next and closes the first set nicely. Jerry and Brent really work the shit outta this one for all its worth. Well done boys. Incredible first set. \n\nThe boys come back out with a very impressive Alabama>GSET which is sure to please. This is not one of my favorite combos, but, this duo comes out swinging with Jerry and Brent doing some nice trading again. Brent\u2019s more laid back vocals are a very nice addition here. I dig Brent so much more when he is not right out in front of everything. Ok, next up comes the Terrapin Station> Playing In The Band > Drums> Space> Uncle John's Band > I Need A Miracle > Bertha > Good Lovin' combo. Terrapin is excellent and Jerry does some incredibly fast, background type of jamming during this one that is really cool sounding. Its like these speedy little riffs all strung together or something.. Playin features a killer jam as well. I am calling it the Fly Like an Eagle jam, because Brent uses some really great and Miller-esque sounding effects during the jam which are very reminiscent of Fly Like an Eagle, particularly in the last 330 before drums. Drums>Space are next which drop into a very peaceful, eloquent sounding UJB. I love a great transition out of Space which provides comfort to the crowd, This one does that nicely. Miracle and Bertha are good, not great and Good Lovin is jammed out nicely(even though I loathe that tune). Casey and Saturday Night round out the evening as encores and this one comes to a close. Simply put, I love this show. I think the 26th is better because of the exploratory nature of the second set, but this is no slouch. We have had discussions before about what type of show or what show would you play someone for their first GD show ever\u2026This would be an outstanding pick. Well balanced setlist featuring some incredible playing and vocals by Jerry. I give this show a A. Great pick guys..",

Jerry channeling Ornette in the runs), that leads into an outrageous Brent-and-drummer-led jam, and then with Uncle John's coming in for a full rinsing out of space. All that follows is, again, wonderfully party-hardy - everybody's rocking - but by that point, the evening's stripes done been earned. Captain and crew in full force.",
