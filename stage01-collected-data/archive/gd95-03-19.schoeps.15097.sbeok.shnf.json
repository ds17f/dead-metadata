Sure, I love a nice tight jam as much as the next head but what they lacked in technical merit they made up for with emotion.  There is an intangible feeling to these later shows.  There is a wonderful sense of desparation in Jerry's singing especially.  You can tell he is on his last legs but still giving it his all for the crowd despite the forgotten lyrics and uneventful jams.  There are some songs like So Many Roads that are unparalelled compared to earlier years.  These shows have actually made me laugh, smile, and cry all at the same time. There is no better emotion than desparity mixed with joy.  These years document the conflict between Jerry's soul and his body.  Somehow the soul always ended up winning.  So I urge all of you to treasure these shows and be grateful for the fragile beauty they convey.",

The UBC was incredible, not because the performance was anything, but the crowd response was one of the most electric experiences I've ever been in the middle of. Also, Jerry's vocal on So Many Roads, particularly toward the end with the repetative, bluesy \"so many roads, so many rooooaaaads\" was as soulful and beautiful as anything I've heard him sing. Otherwise a typical mid-90's show with some nice moments but not very inspired.\n\nAnother reviewer made an interesting point about the conflict between Jerry's body and soul in his later days. He or she felt the soul always won out. I'm not sure. My last two shows were the RFK shows in '95 - his body kicked his soul's ass on the first night and the soul hung in there and made the second night worth seeing.",

That still (after catching 200+ shows of various bands), is the loudest crowd reaction that Ive ever heard or been part of.I still have a crispy aud tape of this show. UJB was ok(from what I remember), but nothing spectacular. I'll give it a 4star, because of sentimental reasons & the UC.\nOne thing though, I remember in the mens room headys were taking bets, literally, there was a guy acting as a bookie!! Never seen that happen @ any show before.I remember laughing soooo hard walking out of that bathroom.\n  d/l for the 1st Unbroken anyway.\n  peace,KC\nps, did I win any $-sure did, I called that m.f*%#@* right that nite!

The dead was about the experience of the show. Each night was different.  Anyone who was there knows how incredible the crowd reaction was to the unbroken chain.  Nothing will ever change that.

      "review_text": "The bitter truth I was at this show, and besides being utterly beside myself at hearing the first live Unbroken Chain, 21 years after the studio release, I came out thinking they played pretty well in the 2nd set.  \n\nAfter listening to the stream, I gotta say it was mostly lame with some really good moments.  The first set is well played, including a great So Many Roads, up until the Chain, when it becomes obvious that Jerry hasn't learned the song.  He never quite did.  \n\nThe second set had some good moments but no long jams (except D/S).  Samson at least is played at its proper tempo, unlike the dragging versions of 1985-86.  By God, Jerry gives it his best, but it's just not there.\n\nCrazy Fingers is next.  Lyrically, this is the worst version I've ever heard of this song.  Musically, it might be the best.  Jerry's middle solo starts a bit shakily, but hangs together, and then gets inspired.  The closing jam is very sweet.  This and Stella are the two highlights of the second set.  \n\nCorinna I HATE, and this jam with Mathilda doesn't do much for me.\n\nStella is good but not as good as I remembered.  It's almost twice as fast as usual, and Jerry wails on the middle jam, but settles for a repetitive, though pretty, lead at the end, with the band crescendoing under him.\n\nNot Fade has a nice, although too brief, Jerry solo.\n\nOverall, the show has enough good that I can't quite give it just 1 star - maybe 1 1/2.  I give it a 2 considering the good quality for an audience recording.",

This show has some of those special moments in it that keep us coming back for more [So Many Roads has very nice crowd/Jerry interaction in the end  & UBC was special- even if for somewhat novel reasons].  These are the reasons we keep coming back.\n\nBeing an addict of the DEAD (a fan-addict).  First, admit you/we are addicts for going to & participating in hours of good & bad performances.  We participate with good intentions...  I am one of these so called \"fans\"(from fanatic).  \n\nI likely saw more bad shows than good (again in my opinion) but the good shows effected me in such a positive way, it will forever be worth me coming back for more, on the chance I may have another enlightening experience. \n\nI try to remind myself as I read these reviews that everyone can Experience the same show differently!\n\nThe sound on this audio is an average audience quality show.

I know full well that the performance was (ahem) not good. Yet it was the greatest experience of pure energy I've ever had. Otherwise, not an impressive show. Since crowd experience can't come across on tape, I'll not factor it in my rating. I'm only rating the performance, not the recording quality.",

I started screaming the second I recognized the song and this huge hairy sweaty guy tapped me on the shoulder asking me \"Is this what I think it is?\" I confirmed to him that it was Unbroken Chain and he held his arms out and we hugged.  It was in incredible experience.  A few years ago, I met Phil and told him this story and that I still had the ticket stub in my wallet.  He laughed and insisted on signing it for me.

One disappointment is that you can actually hear the beginning to UBC quite well...that was not the case 18 years ago, the noise of the crowd was deafening.  An older cassette I have captured it better (I wonder if the other Aud may be that source).  Anyway I used to get this feeling like a chemical upswing when I listened to it...not the same on this source but I appreciate being able to hear the opening a little better.  This was also, I think, the last event at the Spectrum ever?  So show is also historical in that sense.  First set is decent overall..yes its short..but WTF you get the FIRST Unbroken Chain!  I mean c'mon where is the love...I guess some did fade away.  The So Many Roads kicks ass!  Second set is  a normal '95 second set except for the rare, and in my opinion delightfully fun, Matilda.  Crazy Fingers was powerful that night from where I was standing behind Phil dancing in and out of the back hallway (now that is where the love was!!!).    \nThe aquatic themed lighting was especially good for those of us swimming around back there.  Drums/Space was also well done and Miracle rocked as usual.  Stella was poignant and spiritual for all those reflecting on the ephemeral quality of experience that is transcended in music.  Not Fade Away also nice...you can hear Jerry giving a little bit extra.  Brokedown was always good and no exception here.",

I admit the debut of Unbroken Chain was one of my favorite moments at a Dead show, and even though the song wasn't perfect it was a great experience to be apart of. \nAll things considered, with the exception of my first live Alabama, the first set was an embarassment. I remember being disgusted when hearing the first chords of Don't Ease unable to comprehend the band playing a 5 song first set. Thankfully the Unbroken Chain served almost as a 1st set encore, but looking back this had to be perhaps the shortest first set of the 90's.\nThe 2nd set turned out to be a real dud for me at the time both in song selection and performance, and listening to it again has done nothing for me.  \nOverall being in the crowd for the first Unbroken Chain was an unforgettable experience, however the rest of the show is one I'd rather forget.\nBTW- This was not the last event at the Spectrum, as the Flyers played there until May of 1996. In fact they still have had concerts, minor league hockey and other events through early 2008.",

It was a special show for many reasons, but despite being there for \"the bust out\", I was not thrilled with the show.  Part of the issue for me was that I had a very heard time hearing anything that night.  It might have been the cheap seats, it might have been the paper, it might have been the PA - who knows.  I brought along a friend of mine who had expressed interest in the Dead and after the show I recall him being utterly underwhelmed and I recall myself feeling saddened by Jerry's state and the obvious tension between Bobby and Jerry on stage.  Bobby had to step in a few times and play Jerry's parts if I recall and that, while academically interesting, was bizarre to watch.\n\nI had purposely stayed away from listening to this show simply because I didn't expect much from it and the earlier versions I did catch snippets of were had horrid sound quality.  This version sounds quite nice and it (and 14 years of distance) have allowed me to hear this show anew and while not my favorite show ever, it a lot better than I remember it.  Wish I would have appreciated it more at the time.\n\nAs a note to OldSchoolJerry rhetorical question about why the Dead chose this song over any other to bust out, I recent read in Phil's book, Searching for the Sound, that his son, Graham, requested that they learn it and Phil obliged.",

Not a FANTASTIC 90s show just a FANTASTIC show period.\nIn one of the books that came out shortly after Jerrys death I believe Blair Jackson had a quote saying \"we at least had the moment\".\n  This show had \"the moment\". When the noodling after Dont Ease Me In became Unbroken Chain there was a moment, one to cherish. You couldn't believe what you thought you were about to hear.\nThen when it all came together 20000 people freaked the fucked out for a moment. NIIIIIICE !\n  This was a great Garcia night also minus a couple of hiccups. The Alabama Getaway opener was strong, i was glad to see this was back in trhe rotation again on a regular basis. Crazy Fingers and So Many Roads were just fucken WONDERFUL and I tought the Stella Blue rocked with some kick ass guitar playing at the end.\n  I was and still am a big Corrina fan and when Jerry belted out the chorus with a big Corrinaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ah ah ahhhhhh it was GREAT. Matilda was always a big treat for me, a little Carribean flair and you could tell Jerry really had fun with this tune.\n  I see 1995 differently than most. I started seeing the band in 1978 and saw over 200 shows and was just happy to be there. I'll quote Robert Hunter for my opinion on the 1995 Dead.  \" gave the best we had to give - how much they'll never know , never know\"\n   That sums it up - good time - great show - nice memoery and oh yeah THE MOMENT.Furthur in NY in 3 days.

The next I hear it, it is it's own 2nd Set jam. The next time, lyrics added. Finally, months later, it's a full song. \nThrough my entire career as a Union Stagehand, I never saw that in any other band. Most don't even try to do that because it is risky. The very idea of developing a full album's worth of songs in front of a crown of tens of thousands of people is as ballsy as it gets, really, and I praised it every time I witnessed it. \nI mean-- we've heard enough studio rehearsals at this point, it's easy to see doing it live seemed far more productive for them.\nTo me, Dead shows were an adventure. Sure I had my favorite staples I hoped they'd play, and all that, but I rather liked those late era \"What is this they're playing?\" moments, when suddenly everything was utterly new, and unknown, and... EXCITING. \nThe 1990's found the band rolling through a lot of muddy ruts, but those moments of creativity, whether I liked the new tune or not, made the night special to me.

Like most of the crowd, it took 5-10 seconds to realize what was occurring but you will never hear a louder crowd reaction whether it's an NBA, NHL title, or whatever else happens in arenas that's huge. It was an honor to have been a part of Dead history. I remember locking us out of our car hours before the show at a friend's aunts house. It wasn't all my fault, really...but I took the blame. Had to scramble for a locksmith at 3pm on a Sunday, but we made it in plenty of time. Just $80 lighter in the pocket. Other than the Unbroken debut, the show wasn't my favorite and the night before was the better show by far with the Visions (and All Too Much was pretty cool). There was some good jamming I remember during the Corrina>Matilda but Deer Creek 7/20/94 (underrated) was better for that combo. Anyway, I just played the Unbroken track to my daughter to give her an idea of the crowd noise and I got goose bumps all over again. Love this site!! Thanks to you all who contribute. It's really a 3-start show but Unbroken gives it a bump in my book to 4. The picky people who care probably aren't listening to shows from '95 anyway...their loss. ",
