Jerry is just blazing through everything and taking risk after risk to make it fresh and to potentially seek the unknown to find something new. He's playing with his volume knob, fading in and out in almost every jam, breaking down some of the norms of how they've developed songs to this point. This is what I love about this period. Some of my favorite music ever.",

The southeastern audience got the most outrageous show you could get on that night. What a peak! The playing here has a subtlety that ranks as mind-blowing even by '68 standards. <a href=\"https://happywheels2.io\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\">happy wheels</a> 2",

      "review_text": "My wife and I were there I was a 5th year out-of-state Bellarmine student in 1968, trying to delay my graduation to avoid the draft. While I officially resided in Kennedy Hall, I mostly lived with my J-town girlfriend (future wife) in her apartment on Bardstown Rd. I had the Dead's 1st LP and jumped at the chance to see them live. Tickets were cheap ($3-4), like most major rock acts in the 60s. When my wife and I finally left, going on 4am, the Dead were still playing. I don't think this set list is complete, unless there were long gaps between songs that I don't remember. ",

      "review_text": "That Caboose tho '68 is my new favorite year. The year I was born. I was almost four months old. Great Dark Star. But that Caboose tho. In my opinion, THE most San Francisco song from that era. Like all good SF music from that time, it's that inexplicable lysergic jazz rock that QMS and the Plane were doing. They took a lot of risks from '67-69. Honestly, much of what The Dead were doing then hadn't been done before. This was a NEW musical form more or less. \nIt's not rock, or jazz or pop. It's something else enirely. And I say lysergic bc if the date is correct, it's a Saturday show which as we know was THE day of the week they were most likely to um, imbibe. Phil's thunder takes a classical turn. Almost modern classical in a Steve Reich way. Yeah the editing it rough on this one. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars. But we do get lots of great stage banter.",
