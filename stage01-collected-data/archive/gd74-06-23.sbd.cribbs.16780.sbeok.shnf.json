The Jam > Ship of Fools is a VERY unique for the GD way to open a set.  This reminds me of how the Phil Lesh Quintet opens a set.   \n\nThe highlight?  Dark Star Jam > Spanish Jam > US Blues.  This is a Dark Star w/o words --more \"jamband\" foreshadowing.  Check it: *the best Spanish Jam of ALL TIME!** Phil absolutely tears it up.  The segue to US Blues is a one-of-a-kind, can't-buy-it-in-a-store freakish wonder.  You gotta hear it!

This show is a very special show tho, where the \"X\" factor is there is abundance. Every song has that sweet flavor, and every note played with conviction. Jerry gives us a great Cumberland, Half Step and a Black Peter. Plus a rare-only time Let it Rock. The jam into Ship of Fools is a masterpiece in miniature. And I believe the Dark Star Jam was selected for the Many Roads box set, yes? Phil takes the lead on Spanish Jam and drives the band into the best? version of 1974 (see also 7/19 and 7/29). Great Wall of Sound, and a show you'll never get tired of. Recommended!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

The WRP suite is perfect.\nThe Jam into Ship of Fools is awesome.  \nThe whole band is shining, but Keith is GLOWING in this show.

(See how spoiled we are thanks the archive?!?)\n\nThe AUD source has much more power than this source... many 74 SBDs seem to suffer from a lack of, I don't know the technical term, but uh... a lack of \"oomph\".  The AUD source for this show has more \"oomph\", but like I said, I am not a fan of noise reduction.  Makes a show sound like you are listening to it from under a blanket.\n\nPerformance-wise, I figure most folks know what this show is about.

The Dark Star does what Dark Stars did back then, it just goes out there in the best way possible, then into an intense Spanish Jam with Phil just dropping BOMBS all over the Fronton, and then a flawless segue into a kickass U.S. Blues to bring us back to Earth.  Some of my favorite Dead right here.  It's on the box set for a reason.\n\nAnd the rest of the show is no slouch either.  Nice WRS, Cumberland Blues, and everything else is played nicely.

They are Mississippi, Jack S, Let it Rock, Cumberland, China, Big R., Black P., Around, Spanish Jam, U.S. Blues, Sat Night, and Casey. In my own personal rating system I have classified this as Very Good Plus Plus. Above this rating is \"Almost Great,\" \"Great,\" and \"Awesome.\" If the concert had a great Morning Dew or Wharf Rat I might give it a 5 Star. Instead I am giving 4 Stars. It is still worth your time downloading but there are better out there IMHO if your time is limited. In particular, for this time frame, go to five days earlier to 6/18/74. I have given that an Almost Great. I have reviewed it here and have given it \na 5 Stars. Click on my name to see that review if you are so inclined. Also, not \"officially\" reviewed yet, but in my own personal rating I have given 5/17/74 a Great. (I believe I got htat from GD Live). Both 5/17/74 and 6/18/74 are highly recommended along with the TV show Rock Star INXS, Alice In Chains, and Nathan Hot Dogs. \n\nWhat is great about this concert is Let It Rock. As most of you know that is an anomaly. I have not heard them play it in any other concert. Like others, I have heard it played by the Jerry Garcia Band. Keystone Berkeley, Palo Alto \nsomething or other, good times, long ago. Also great are Around and Around and Spanish \nJam. I am not a big fan of U.S. Blues but I really like this one.\n\nVery Good Plus Plus. 4 Plus Stars.",

The first 4 songs of the 2nd set are equally unimpressive.  Worse, between sets, there's all that horrific, hideous noise (Phil & Ned, \"Seastones\")!  What were they thinking to torture their fans like this?\n\nOn the other hand, the Dark Star>Spanish Jam is among the greatest jams of all time.  All the hype already said here about this jam is true.  Get this show, skip the Phil & Ned noise, crank up the Dark Star, and just listen.  Your life will be changed for the better.\n\nThere are a couple of audience patches, but they don't hurt too much.  There are none during the big jam. Outside of those patches, which don't sound that bad, it's a pristine board.\n\nI can't give this show 5 stars, because it really has nothing that impressive outside of the Dark Star>Spanish Jam and maybe the WRS>China Doll.  I can't give it any less than 4, because the DS>Spanish is that good all by itself.  DS>Spanish SIX stars, rest of show 3, Phil & Ned minus 100,000.\n\nRevised to say:  Sorry if I offended some people who actually LIKE Phil & Ned, but it reminds me of some alley cats I've heard in late summer.  In fact, if you play it really loud, you'll get some toms right outside your door.\n\nRevised again:  I hope people can see the humor behind the harsh-sounding words here.",

Of course, as colorful notes begin to fly out of the runaway semi it quickly turns into a psychedelic tour bus that is the concert, hopping, skipping, doing flips, and morphing with each joyous note Garcia bends off the fretboard. And before visions of that guy in the first row of the Grateful Dead Movie may appear, the prelude to US is a wondrous strut in which Phil nails that perfectly place note \u2013 not a bomb, but the definitive turn-the-corner moment bringing in this US Blues of early summer.

      "review_text": "They did not prevent it from rocking <br />Perhaps it's surprising that so many great and/or historical shows went down in Florida. There are also a string of hot shows on this tour, including the following show in Providence (a tour peak; and quite different from this night), demonstrating the levels they were gaining through summer '74. This show has enjoyed enduring popularity because the Jerry Moore AUD [likely his most revered] was heavily traded BitD of B&amp;P, and often the lone representative from this tour on tape lists. Tempos often bogged in '74 and The Wall of Sound tended to record in a flatter, less engaging way, with an undynamic image, but put that aside and there is much of note from this night. Giving the MTX its due improved my opinion.\n\nFirst Set. The sound is a mess at first, both SBD and AUD.  Things start to settle and the playing starts to perk at the end of <i>Black Throated</i>. After a long tech repair, a Tico-Tico No Fub\u00e1 heralds a mixed <i>Half-Step Mississippi. Beat it on Down the Line</i>-4 is not tight, but the set launches during a spry <i>Row Jimmy</i> and never looks back. There are true sparks for <i>Jack Straw</i>. Bobby's guitar unfortunately goes missing a couple times on the SBD/OFF, so use a MTX or AUD (the latter sounds amazing for a '74). Then comes the ultimate rarity. <i>Let it Rock</i> was only played once [Jer had been playing it in Garcia &amp; Saunders]. Not sure how Jer knew it. We knew it from the import Brown Sugar 7\". The Stones knew it because the original Berry single was a Brit hit (not stateside). But playing it is about the same/easy as the other Berrys, and they should've kept this one and switched up their Berrys a little more \u2013 much as I love Promised Land. Bobby is still faint on the OFF so use the MTX. <i>Cumberland</i> is an exciting version. Dig Keith and listen @5mins when Jer briefly quotes Hank Garland's Sugar Foot Rag (sans his trademark tape delay slapback). The sources aren't great here [again, more Bobby guitar on the MTX]. That rush continues into <i>El Paso</i>. Bobby thinks it's too uptempo and tries to slow the others, but that's what makes this one rise up (look over the gunwale and you'll see it bobbing). After, somebody shouts for Alligator \u2026 in Miami \u2026 in '74. <i>To Lay Me Down</i> is quite good, in fact the solo is a best-ever candidate; and listen to Keith behind [MTX slightly better than SBD/OFF]. <i>Weather Report Suite</i> is just whopping. There are several great sections. This was the first Phil &amp; Ned Seastones. But why in the middle of the tour and then not until the second Miami show? The very beginning was not captured by any tapers. I presume it took them by surprise. The OFF fades in @3\u00bdmins on the SBD.\n\t\t  \nSecond Set. The jam into <i>Ship of Fools</i> is a unique warm-up/lead-in, as Phil starts and Bobby falls in, followed by others (w/Lagin on Fender Rhodes 88). A must-hear-once. <i>Big River</i> is the usual great '74; even so, the <i>Black Peter</i> surprises as it picks up tempo and reaches a sweet end jam. If you listen closely in the beginning you can hear how Phil's strings each had their own output in '74. [Bobby's guitar ducks out of the mix again making AUD/MTX a better proposition]. Jer &amp; Brent get busy for an average <i>Around &amp; Around</i> [Bobby's heard ONLY on the AUD]. After more shouts for Alligator comes the third <i>Dark Star</i> of just six in '74. This one never does get around to vox, and the full wankery common to '74s is an example of why they put it to bed for so long. There's no real cohesion until 15mins, where it feels like it's finally launching (the <b>So Many Roads</b> version starts 10mins in). Shortly thereafter, Jer starts a Spanish Jam, or is it the drummers? 5mins is long for a Spanish and allows Jer &amp; Phil both to expand on the theme. It's great, but a bit of classic Dead occurs as it accelerates and morphs toward USB. Phil responds, going from Spanish &gt; to jazz &gt; to blues in less than 1min. He's ready for anything! [Bobby's still heard much better on AUD/MTX]. The Spanish Jam started in Born Cross-Eyed jams, then in '74 showed up in Truckin' &amp; TOO, then here [though also in a Dark Star in '70]. The next appearance is in '81, coming out of Space. With the long intro jam you could argue this 7min section is the longest <i>U.S. Blues</i>. It too is sans vox \u2013 at first. The <b>SMR</b> version cuts 1min @16:47 (the shine your shoes verse). You can hear Bobby much better on AUD/MTX and the bass is less distorted; but Keith is louder on the OFF, if you prefer. But man they are having fun sitting on the USB couch. <i>Uncle John's Band</i> is a standard '74 [use MTX], but this is a strong <i>Saturday Night</i>, starting way uptempo. There's a tuning of O du Lieber Augustin, heard best on the SBD. But you again need the MTX/AUD to hear Bobby on <i>Casey Jones</i> (and Lagin, who came back out for the encore).\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B  \u00a0\u00a0[B- for SBD/OFF]\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B- \u00a0[C+ for SBD/OFF]\nOverall = 3\u00be stars \u00a0 [3 stars for SBD/OFF]\n \nHighlights:\nJack Straw \u2013 spritely, sparky\nLet it Rock \u2013 mostly just historical, but they let it rock\nCumberland Blues \u2013 fun, and listen for Keith\nTo Lay Me Down \u2013 a bit of jazz lilt in a best-of version\nWeather Report Suite \u2013 whopping\nSpanish Jam&gt;U.S. Blues \u2013 classic GD sequence out of Dark Star and into a jammy USB\n\nSOURCES: The 145674_aud is an upgrade of the Jerry Moore AUD (a more recent upload differs due to EQ &amp; digital filtering). The 122270_mtx_tobin is a fine (and crucial) matrix. The cribbs_16780 SBD ran 1% fast in many places, and has been remastered, repitched and repatched as the 122255_upg-sbd_smith-tobin. Let it Rock is on newer copies of <b>Mars Hotel</b> (needs -1% pitch, as below). Parts of Dark Star&gt;Spanish Jam&gt;U.S. Blues are on <b>So Many Roads</b> (needs -1% pitch). Essentially the whole show is on <b>Dave's 34</b>. It cuts about 25mins of tunings from the first set, and uses two SBD sources to cover gaps (w/ an excerpt of Seastones). It runs sllightly fast for Jack Straw through Cumberland and from 3: 30 in Dark Star through U.S Blues, <u>needing -1% pitch correction</u>.",

I haven't had this problem with other files I've downloaded. Anybody have an idea? I use a MacBook and not a Windows computer, in case that question comes up.\n\nAs for this show, I think it's beautiful. I prefer 6/28/74 cause that Weather Report Suite cannot be beat. June '74 is magic.",

The opening of the second set, with that sweet jam into Ship of Fools will melt  you.  The transition from Dark Star through Spanish Jam into US Blues is one for the ages.  Brilliant, wonderful show.  Don't miss this one.",

The sound starts off a bit muffled, but the quality improves by the time Ramble On Rose is through and the band is fucking locked in.  \n\nThe vocals are rockin, Donna is smooth.\n\nKeith is right at home in the heart of the mix. \n\nJerry is out of this world.  Phenomenal playing by his high standards.  By Half Step the band is taking you to another planet.  \n\nLook at the set list!",
