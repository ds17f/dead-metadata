Really appreciate the New Year's Tickets in 1990, and those seats four rows from the stage for my last show at Tampa Stadium in 1995. Without the mail order, I wouldn't have seen even a tenth of the shows I saw. Thanks for helping me have the most fun I ever had!\n\n\nJuly 24, 2005\nReviewer: <b>smarcus</b>\n\nSubject: 6/9/77 When I truely got ON THE BUS! \nI had been seeing the Grateful Dead on and off since May of 1967 (I had first seen Jerry Garcia perform in 1961 with Robert Hunter at my elementary school, I was 8 1/2). I went to the 6/7/77 show and was blown away, so I decided to go back for the 6/9/77. I came away absolutely stunned and to this day it is probably the best Grateful Dead show I've ever been too, or at least in the top 3-5. I craved this show, but didn't actually get a tape of it until 1979 when I got a really bad audience tape from a co-worker at BASS tickets in Oakland named David Gans. I lived with that tape until 1983 when I started working for the Grateful Dead (setting up Grateful Dead Ticket Sales). After about two or three weeks there, Phil Lesh came up to me in the kitchen of the main office and told me that everyone was happy to have me there and gave me his home phone number and told me to call him if he could ever help me. I thanked him and sheepishly asked him if it would be possible to get tapes of some shows out of the vault. He said sure as long as I didn't go crazy. I told him I was only interested in one show and that was 6/9/77. He said he would work on it. About three weeks later a little package was left in my mail slot at the office, it contained cassette copies directly off the vault masters of 6/7/77, 6/8/77 & 6/9/77 with a note from Phil saying that he forgot which night I wanted so he had copies of all three made. Well, I had never heard such sound quality of a live Dead show that had not been on record. In fact, in the beginning of the Grateful Dead Hour Gans used my copies for the show. I still have those tapes and I have burned them all directly from the cassette's to CD. I don't know if this copy comes from mine, but it still sounds great!!!!\n\n\nJune 25, 2005\nReviewer: <b>rollandfin</b>\n\nSubject: yes it is yes it is \nwe are apparently going to debate between the 5-9-77 H-S-F and this one for a long long time, I will admit that the difinitive virsion of Help was played in Buffalo, but Slipknot thru Franklins Tower was mastered at the Winterland. See, Buffalo ain't as lame duck as it might seen, One Dead President, and one Smokin Help, a pretty slow 76 years in between but well worth it. This \"i repeat\" this is the stuff dick's picks should be made of, sure it's well curculated, but it's got pitch problems and a cut here and there. released as a pick, provided the vault copy is healthyer??? who wouldn't want an upgrade of this one?! post the obscurites for the hardcore heads to sift through, remaster and sell the cannons! 77 stars\n\n\nJune 24, 2005\nReviewer: <b>devlin</b>\n\nSubject: High energy \nHigh energy from start to finish. Great first set, incredible second set. In my opinion, one of the best Gd show ever.\n\n\nJune 22, 2005\nReviewer: <b>andrew m</b>\n\nSubject: Smokin'... \nThis is a great show all the way through... Very strong Half-Step to open, with Cassidy, Deal and MNS very strong in the first set as well, but the real beauty of this show is the gem of a second set... Samson is smokin' as always, but the Help>Slip>Frank is just about the best thing ever... This Slipknot kicks so much ass... Way, way out there, and back strong into an all-timer of a Franklins... But we're only just beginning.. Check out Phil's huge intro to Estimated... Blow the walls down, will ya? And from there, the rest of the setlist speaks for itself... Good stuff all the way through...\n\n\nMay 26, 2005\nReviewer: <b>august 1031</b>\n\nSubject: helpslipfrank!\nThis is a monster version of my favorite suite of songs, @10 minutes longer than the 5-09-77 a month earlier which for me is the definative version. This performance of Help starts off with a quick pace and great energy moves pretty quickly into a long spacey Slip. Franklins is very long at 17 minutes and does contain some great moments especially the last 4 minutes or so which wrap up the song in a nice breezy relaxed fashion. Anyway the show is a definate 5 star, the help slip frank is a 4, it just meanders a bit to much for my tastes but thats probably why some folks love it so much. For other great performances of helpslipfrank check out 5-9-77 (the Sound Board offered on this site is one of the best!),8-13-75,10-09-76,and to hear a great later version try 6-14-91(view from the vault 2).\n\n\nMay 07, 2005\nReviewer: <b>darkstarpat</b>\n\nSubject: Pure Energy \nThe energy on this Franklin's Tower is out of this world.

I will update my review when I'm done listening, but for now, 5 stars for no mistakes, great sound (except the Sunrise patch from a degraded SBD) and a SMOKIN' MNS!\n\n\nMarch 17, 2005\nReviewer: <b>stratocaster</b>\n\nSubject: Estimated>St. Stephen \namazing segue between the two songs and this is definitely one of the more challenging transitions that they could attempt...it's one of those Dead moments in which you have to listen to the musical passage repeatedly...excellent...Help Slip Franklins features one of the best Slipknots played...awesome quality\n\n\nFebruary 04, 2005\nReviewer: <b>flashbackmagic</b>\n\nSubject: incredible show but. \nIf i had not just got done listening to 10/11/77, it would be spectacular. Sorry to say the Hlp>SLP>FNKLNS from october absolutely laid the song to rest,as it was not revived until the 80s. Not to take away from the version here, its ashame i l;istened to the m back to back. If you havnt yet, please DL 10/11/77 lol I never said this H/S/F didnt smoke! \n\n\nDecember 22, 2004\nReviewer: <b>Rivertrance</b>\n\nSubject: THE Best! \nI have a copy of the cassette from the vault (Thanks, Steven Marcus!), and in my humble opinion, this is the best show I have ever heard. No less than David Gans says that he never gets tired of hearing this show. The second set is pure magic. If you don't have this show, download it NOW!...:-) \n\n\nDecember 08, 2004\nReviewer: <b>icecreamjay</b>\n\nSubject: ENERGY!! \nWell I haven't heard 10/11, but I had this on cassette and its one of my favorites. Set 2 is a monster. It seems as though the band was pissed off about the technical difficulties and when they finally kick into the Help on the way it's with a vengeance. In my mind it seems as though the band is powered by a healthy helping of fine columbian powder if you know what I mean. Probably the most aggressive uptempo version I've heard. I have to say this one and the One from the Vault version from 75 are my favorites. Oh yeah the sound quality is superb and the song selection is excellant. Worth the download for set 2 alone. ps - check out 1-22-78, no help slip franklins, but another juicy set 2.\n\n\nNovember 01, 2004\nReviewer: <b>4x4</b>\n\nSubject: flashbackmagic\nIs insane....this help>slip>franklin's SMOKES 10/11/77.

Def check out this cassidy and st. stephen as well. \n\n\nAugust 21, 2004\nReviewer: <b>sheikyerbouti</b>\n\nSubject: outrageous show \nI got my first copy of this as an audience in '82 and played this until it fell apart - repaired it and then a beer fell on it at a frat party and it was curtains from there so thanks to whomever it was that donated this!! As a funny aside my copy had a dude that had eaten way way too much acid and was just ranting out requests the whole first set - by the time finiculi finicula rolled around with a last gasp he howled 'play anything... play anything.... I don't caaaaaruuh'- been there pal someone stole the face right off ur head. Not to be long-winded but this show is worth it half step opener usually a good sign, music... sampson and the rest of the 2nd set clear through just explode with musical energy. If anyone ever tries to explain why we love this band so much start them with this..... enjoy, I sure have+\n\n\nMay 28, 2004\nReviewer: <b>drosenbe</b>\n\nSubject: second set = amazing \nI don't think the first set is all that amazing, but the second set is one of the best I've ever heard. It combines all of the best songs that were normally put in the second sets of '77 (other than of course scarlet>fire) with some awesome playing.\n\n\nMay 21, 2004\nReviewer: <b>John Hell</b>\n\nSubject: Damn good show \nOne of my top five fave's for theyear.

Many people's all time favorite, including Steve Marcus of the Dead's staff (i.e. he should know :-). Second set is one of the truly perfect jams, but first set is great too. Garcia is just eloquent thruout. Check out previous nite 6-8 too. First nite of the run 6-7 is totally outclassed by these too.\n\n\nApril 12, 2004\nReviewer: <b>dr. flashback</b>\n\nSubject: top 5! \nThe Dead played 3 runs at Winterland in 1977 - March,June and Dec.and all are worth collecting.This was their last show of the June run and their last summer show for 1977! Do they pull out all the stops? You betcha! The 1st Set is short but high energy playing throughout. Even Sunrise is good! But the 2nd Set is unbelieveable. One of the best Help>Slipknots of 1977, with a St.Stephen>NFA>St.Stephen that rivals Cornell 5/8/77. And a Terrapin to boot! One of the Doctor's top 5 for 1977. Play this one going down the road sometime - you'll get there! Dr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "All Time Top 10? In any other year, this would be the show of the year, but in 1977, I have to rank this one as #2 to Cornell, but it's damn close.  So close in fact, that while listening to the second set last night, I thought, just for a minute, wow, this might actually be better, but then I booted up the stephen>nfa>stephen>dew from Cornell and came to my senses.  \n\nAll that said, this is just a sick sick show.  The just exactly perfect 1/2 step is one of, if not THE hottest 1/2 steps of '77 (right up there with the Englishtown Raceway version).  See also the TLEO and MNS as the highlights of the 1st set (I'm not a big LL Rain or Sunrise fan).\n\nThe 2d set produces the #1 HSF of all time, it's just that simple.  While 5/9 is strong, it just does not hold a candle to this version.  The Slipknot nods in the general direction of stronger than dirt from Kezar March 75 and spirals around phil's ever present carpet bomb boomlets, flirting with avant garde jazz themes and generally kicking the ass of any listener who dares enter the Dead's creative realm.  Jerry's voice on Franklin's is pure honey and the bop diddy bop bounce of the bass line and the guitar leads that stretch fo'ever ... wow.  31 plus minutes when all is said and done. Even as Franklin's is melting away, Phil goes Hiroshima to announce the onset of Estimated (sub woofer be forewarned) and Jerry just LEEEEANS on that wa wa.  Some might say that Estimated was overplayed in '77 (and you might have a point) but part of that overplaying allowed for alot of experminentation with the tune, this is a hot version.  The Stephen>NFA>Stephen does not match the aforementioned Barton Hall version (then again NO version does) but it's still hot hot hot .. and even more so as they seque into a hot Terrapin Station>Sugar Mags closer.  Double encore, what more could you want?\n\nIn a year of so many ridiculously great shows, this TRULY stands apart.  Do yourself (and your ears) a favor and get this show, POST HASTE.\n\nHIGHEST RECOMMENDATION",

I carried it with me everywhere I went and played it all the time. Through the years it wore down and I lost the tape. This entire show is not only magical but IMHO has some sort of Divine intervention. This recording is crystal clear and it's mind boggling to imagine how human beings can make music like this. Since I've gotten my hands on this soundboard copy I've listened to it A LOT. The Morning Dew is the best ever!!! (Augusta MN. 1984 is a close 2nd). When I catch a buzz and turn off the lights, light a candle, and listen to this Dew, it's beyond description. Many times I've had an out of body experience where (during the Dew) my spirit and soul is litterally transported back to 1974 and I'm in the Winterland Arena. I can feel the energy and feel what the band (esp. Jerry) is experiencing at that moment in time. I've tried this with other shows and songs but never had the powerful transformation in time like this Morning Dew. This is all without LSD. The last jam in AM Dew I can feel A presence guiding Jerry, that jam is not only the band but SOMETHING else too. The end of the show is soooooo sweet. The end of Not Fade Bobby is litterally shredding his vocal chords, Not Fade AWAAAAAAAAAAAY. The best and sweetest Baby Blue ever!!! Make sure that when you listen to the Dew you have it turned up loud. Jerry and the band bring this to a whisper and he fizzles the notes away. If anyone knows of other shows out there that they have had this type of experience please email me and let me know: scottlacey2000@msn.com",

I got a little toasty during the show (yeah, I was there... really!) and don't remember much, but I know I enjoyed it.  Have a listen, you'll enjoy it too!  Five stars all around.",

It's not just the inspired setlist (Estimated->St. Stephen->NFA->St. Stephen->Terrapin anyone?) and it's not just the ultra tight and energetic 1977 playing, it's 'what makes the Grateful Dead so special?' on 3 cds. \nAlright, so maybe the first set isn't totally mind-blowing, but after that smokin' Samson and Delilah, the 'Help>Slip>Franks' is about as epic as they come.

      "review_text": "Five Stars For Nostalgic Values  Warranted When the GD retired in 1974, I decided to see the world, engage in possible adventure and generally, re-create. After tramping around the world, I returned to the SF Bay Area 10-10-76 and heard that the GD were with the Who at the Oakland ballyard. I was homeless, I had no money, no job, no transportation, but I went to the concert and stood near the main gate. A kind soul asked me if I wanted a free ticket and I followed him. He led me to the backstage entrance where there stood a group of friends. After introductions, this other guy walks up among us handing out tickets. We dashed into the Coliseum just as the GD hit the first few notes of MAW. Within weeks, I was gamefully employed and living with roommates in my own house. I bought a car within two months and had freedom to party.\n\nIn January 77 I read that the GD were playing Winterland for 3 nights in March. I got tix for all 3, and all 3 were great. Then, when I read that the Dead were going to be back at Winterland in June, I was wondering if the Dead would top their March run. I got tix for all 3.\n\nThe March run had been a complete metamorhosis from the Who show. The GD were like a whole other band 5 months later. It was as if the Who had rubbed off and now the Dead was this power-surged supergroup with new found energy. But could they ever top the March run? Yes, and it seems to me that each night's successive show was merely a fine seamed tapestry, one contributing and blending and building upon another until the point of spontaneous combustion.\n\nOh, and how!!! they did it. This new found Dead was not a fluke. This three night run in June was even more psyche altering. They not only topped the March run in spades, but each night was better, and this was the peak of the peak night.\n\nOf the 100 shows in SF I attended, The only show of this particular mock up of the Grateful Dead that tops this show is the one on 12-29-77. After the March run, then the Movie, then the June run, it just didn't seem possible for them to top themselves. The December run was really tremendous, but you could tell they were tired and  a little green around the gills. The December run didn't command the oomph that these June shows exhibited.\n\nTo me, the band's fabulous and energetic 1977 was kind of the death knell for the band. Very quickly, in 1978, this again became a job to them and it again became a business. But 1977 was the year for consistent energetic arena rock with a verve they hadn't presented in quite a while. Oh, yes, there were many tremendous shows afterwards, and throughout the remaining career ~ don't get me wrong, but I am speaking from a perspective of nostalgia. Nostalgia only recalls what it wishes to recall. Unless, of course, you are able, 30 years to the day, to hear this masterpiece and revel in it all over again. \n\nThere is a difference. Then, we saw darkly, as thru a glass, but now we see all. Except, perhaps having eyes wide open isn't all it is cracked up to be. Fate be damned. Hence we set the controls thirty years hence and paint, cut, or copy ourselves into the tunnelvision diorama of June 9, 1977.\n\nWinterland comes alive and lives again!",

I would say \"all-time,\" but I'm not quite as well-versed in 80's and 90's as I am 60's and 70's, of which I'd consider myself more than qualified to state an opinion. This is a desert-island pick for sure, and this is the best version of the show I've heard, by far. \n\nThe first set is very well played, with stellar versions of 1/2-Step and Loser, with Loser possibly being the best version I've ever heard. Jerry's mid-song solo is just exactly perfect, and he puts more emotion into it than I've ever heard in a '77 version. Also, while I'm not a big fan of LL Rain, this one is one of my favorites, and one of the few versions I don't skip, as the whole show flows so well together.\n\nThe second set is pure magic. The setlist should say it all, but setlists can be decieving. Not here, as every song is played to perfection, and I dare anyone to name a better Help>Slip>Franklin's of the 70's. Sure, there may be better Helps(5/22/77,) or Franklin's(I seriously doubt it,) but there are no better versions of the entire suite. 9/27/76 comes extremely close, but it's broken up by an Other One and Wharf Rat, so I don't know if that counts. Either way, it's breathtaking.\n\nThe St. Stephen here, coming out of an excellent Estimated Prophet, is just plain awesome, with an extended guitar solo at the beginning of the song, extremely rare for '77 Stephens. The first verse doesn't start for over 2 minutes! Very well-executed, and one of the few mid-late 70's versions I'd put up there with a '68 or '69. And while the NFA is great, it's not on the level of 5/8 or 9/3, but you can hardly give it a strike for that. \n\nThe Terrapin is played to perfection, which means it's also one of the best ever, as they rarely jammed it out during this era, so the best versions are the ones with the least amount of mistakes, and with the most emotion-filled singing from Jer Bear. Well, this is the one then. It's absolutely beautiful.\n\nFrom beginning to end, a true classic.\n\nCharlie Miller, as always, is God. Okay, A God.",

      "review_text": "Help Slip Hell Yeah! So, this is going out of order for me in my quest to review 1976 in whole, but I was listening to this show and felt compelled to at least put a placeholder in for a future full review.\n\nI believe it was Phil who said that this was what he thought the best dead show of the 70's was.  I will look for a source for that quote, but if it was indeed true I can totally see why.  The first 8 songs are typical high quality 1977 first set material.  The whole evening takes on a whole new complexion during Music Never Stopped.  Check out the pre-solo 3/4 section.  Everyone is synched up, Keith is giving it his all, and the two headed rhythm beast is locked in.  Jerry's solo is note perfect, and cranks the intensity higher and higher each bar.  You can literally hear the surge of energy during the solo. It must have been amazing to be at the Winterland that evening.  I bet the building damn near floated away into the ether.\n\nSet 2 gives us an incredible reading of HSF--perhaps my favorite of all of the versions in the 70's (and really, it was never better than in 1976-77, right?), and HSF-Terrapin is one of those classic GD segments.  Seriously, go listen.  This show is one of my top 77 shows.\n\nOh yeah, to the ancient asshole dogging on someone below that suffers with depression, go be alone with yourself and figure out why you are such a cold-hearted jerk.  The world needs less and less of your kind.",

May 1977 is without a doubt, a truly pivotal mark of the Grateful Dead\u2019s journey. No one can argue against that opinion. If you listen to the Dead as much as myself, or Mind Wondrin\u2019, Bman, Dave L, etc. then you\u2019d have Also found this to be true. You can really only listen to Cornell so many times without the question arising, \u201cwhat else is out there?\u201d \n\nWell, look no further, because you might have just found your answer. And, what\u2019s the answer but another riddle. Another blemish - that makes one think, this can\u2019t be everything\u2026surely, I am not there. Not even close!!! You\u2019re just getting started. If you\u2019re new to the Dead, just finding out that there is other music to be heard besides Travis Scott..you\u2019ve found something worth its weight in Gold. Enjoy my friends \u2014 the end of the Beginning. \n\nPeace ~ Nick. \n",

What makes this remarkable is that the energy level and intensity remained off the charts from start to finish. I would have liked Keith a bit lower in the mix. Don't get me wrong, he sounds great and I am a keyboard player, but he shouldn't be louder than Jerry. Anyway, for sure the boys were firing on all cylinders this night, and I am sorry I wasn't there (well, I was 12). ",
