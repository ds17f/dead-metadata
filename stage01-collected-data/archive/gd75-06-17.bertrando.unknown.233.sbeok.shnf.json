      "review_text": "First Set Madness... I have been waiting to review this to spread the word about what really is one of The Best.  Where to begin...where to begin.  Well the beginning I suppose.\n  With the first Crazy Fingers ever, and man they came out swinging for the fences!!  Dreamlike, serene, everything you ever wanted.  The jam in the BIODTL and Big River are strong and the band keeps playing hardball.  For a long time I thought this was the first Peggy O ever...but i guess not?  Either way it's not particularly a fav...but the chill style this night is akin to the mellow of the Crazy F. But to skip ahead...\n\nThe debut of Help on the Way.  No lyrics yet either.  Just a jam.\n\nSlipknot! also debuts somewhere in there too.\nAnd the first Franklin's Tower, which in all honesty hadn't obtained the mastery it later would, but is nonetheless a strong first showing. I suppose this is really what makes my point about the Help jam because for the being the debut it rages incredibly hard.\n\nPivotal show.",

      "review_text": "Bob Freed Memorial Concert Hi Katie! Audience recording, not soundboard, so be advised.   Noteworthy show since it is the only time in '75 the Dead played Winterland, I think...  Various combinations in and around the Bay Area all year as The Jerry Garcia Band, which had Billy on drums and Keith and Donna.  Also Kingfish and even the Keith and Donna Band were playing all the time, but the Dead were on hiatus at this time.  This show billed as the 'Bob Freed Memorial',  opened with The Emotions, then Keith and Donna, then Kingfish.  The next act was 'Jerry Garcia and Friends', not the Jerry Garcia Band, as usual.  And since there was a confirmed 'Phil sighting', I think everyone knew what was up- the place was crawling-jam packed.  Excellent vibe- two hour long set- not the usual length, but everyone just so thankful that it was the Dead.  Show sold out in advance, which was rare at Winterland for Kingfish and Garcia.  Got a miracle ticket for a friend, his first Dead show, on the sidewalk outside before the show for $15.00, a pint of Cuervo Gold and a couple of joints of gold.  Poor bastard who gave up that ticket!  Another rare, historical show. Give it four.",

I just discovered this i-trove.\nLike the SNACK concert earlier that year, I always enjoyed going to Grateful Dead concerts that I thought would be a little out of the ordinary, hoping the band be inspired by the change. I guess this show doesn't exactly qualify, since they were on an indefinite hiatus from performing as a group anyway. However, when we (I) saw the poster for the show we knew what \"Jerry Garcia and friends\" meant. \n\nI'd also like to say that Keith and band cooked! This was a nice surprise.",

The super slowed down Peggy-O is fantastic. Help>Slip>Franklins is great imo, especially the Franklins laid back pace and the anomally of no words in the Help section.\n\nThe recording: for this time period, I think it's quite good. Garcias guitar shines. You can hear the sound of Winterland on this one. Personally I don't think they get much better for this era. but that's me, I love Aud's that really seem to capture the whole feel of the show and this one does it.",

It would have been sweet if Crazy Fingers just went to Peggy-O (don't know if there are any key issues with that transition, but the two vibes of both those versions would have created a solid heroin-sheek vibe--set the pace for the rest of the evening). Mellow.\n\n(As a pointer the best Peggy-O ever is the London's Rainbow Theatre (March 21st, 1981))...knock you on the floor mellow.",

As for Peggy O, this one, as stated previously, is like none that I have heard before. I am a big fan of this song and this one is no exception. I have never heard it this slow and mellow before. This one make other versions almost seem like rockers in comparison. It is that mellow. This is worth checking out just for that alone. I thought the BIODTL was pretty sweet too. Try it.

      "review_text": "dirty turkey Let's not overlook the Dirt.  I remember that summer.  I was 13 living in Montana and knew nothing of the Dead except for Uncle John's and Truckin' which happened to be on an 8-Track my dad bought called Superstars of the 70's.  Anyway, on PBS there was this special about the Grateful Dead, and how they were on hiatus, or maybe calling it quits, with interviews and concert footage.  This boy was intrigued, let me tell you.  And then Jerry's on the screen and he smiles and says something like they'll never really call it quits:  \"We're music junkies, man!\"  That stuck in my head for some reason.  It wasn't 'til '77 that I would get my butt to a show.\n\nBut this is indeed a pivotal show, and it makes me wonder.  All that Blues for Allah stuff, and the creation of some serious space jazz.  But then Sugar Mag and US Blues kind of let you know that they're not gonna dig too deep for too long.  As much as I always loved dancing to pop tunes, I was there to dive into the belly of the whale.  I guess it's not a swim if you can't dry off, eh?",

      "review_text": "mind-blowing They only did a scant handful of shows in 75, but every one had Blues for Allah and Stronger than Dirt.  Why they stopped playing those two pieces is beyond me, and \"pieces\" describes them better than \"songs\" - they're true compositions, albeit with lots of room for jamming.  I guess with Jerry getting more and more hooked on rat, they didn't keep up the rehearsals.  \n\nIt seems a sad pattern with them - they dropped The Eleven and New Potato Caboose in 69, dropped Blues for Allah and Stronger than Dirt after 75, didn't play Help>Slip during 86-88, didn't play Lazy Lightning after 84, and didn't break out the Chain until Jerry was on death's door.  All the most challenging (and some of the most satisfying) material was left unplayed  for long stretches. \n\nSo, oh well, we only have 4 live performances of Blues for Allah and Stronger Than Dirt.  I highly recommend getting, or at least streaming, them all.  This recording is very good sound quality outside of a few brief dropouts.  The performance of Blues>Drums>Dirt>Blues is stellar, as is the long Slipknot!,  which got severely truncated on most of the 90's versions.",

This show really captures that feeling that went out of Dead shows about thetime the Brent era started.  (Don't get me wrong, Brent was OK.) There is a real sense in this era that the fellas are challenging themselves to be better and tat they are truly earnest about their musicianship.  They ripped a few monsters in this time, like the unbeleivable Cornell '77 Dew that puts virtually every other rock band on the planet out in Jerry's ashtray.  (btw: Major thanks to Dan for the matrix post elsewhere on this server.)  Blah blah blah, I especially like the intro.  Some people liked to dis Uncle Bobo, but without him there would be no us, (to paraphrase Miles).  I really f**king miss Jerry.  It is so bittersweet to listen to this stuff.",

The Banter is quite interesting.\nIn response to another reviewer's posting, I thought it was a little strange that the someone in the crowd wouldn't want to hear Eyes of the World.  After listening w/ headphones, it appears that the coversation was by a Taper himself wanting a short song before Peggy because he only had about 10 min of tape left & his batteries were in need of a change.  Another Taper (maybe Rob?) agreed to the same problem.  The tape cuts right after Peggy just making it.  Right after & before MAMU, it sounds as if the same mic holder is being complained to by a guy (in front) of him for sliding his equipment up too far.\n\nAs far as the music, isn't that Donna that joins late in SSDD ~7:00?  And the best part of hearing this show, when I listen to Blues for Allah ~1:10-3:20, I'm reminded of the melody of what would eventually become the instrumental part of Terrapin, At a Siding, as in the Outtakes of 2-20-77, although not as masterful.  So it looks like this little played song was not just left behind entirely, but built upon.  I wonder if anyone else hears this?",
