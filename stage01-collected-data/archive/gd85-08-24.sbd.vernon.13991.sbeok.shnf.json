Set 1 shows what happens when a band can't hear each other in the stage monitors - Bobby's amp buzzes nastily in West L.A. and he also manages to step on Jerry's solos a bit.  Minglewood's pretty bad.  They pull themselves together for FOTD and fall apart during Hell in a Bucket.  Not helping matters is a seemingly uninspired and progressively uninterested Jerry and a Phil who can't hear the flailing drummers well enough to lock into them.  Brent plays as well as he can, but it's not enough.\n\nSet 2 shows them recovering a little, but they have a tough time getting into any groove together - they try for a jam at the end of He's Gone, but Jerry's already left.  Drums and Space are decent - they spend 40 sec. trying to get Truckin' going and the rest of the set is strictly go through the motions music.

The night before the show we camped up on that hill across the 80 from the resort. We were listening to Dead Set with this Bro who came solo on some classic beat-up chopper. This guy was probably twice our age and an Old School Head. The stories he told had us in both stitches and captivated. Later, we walked up that hill to where some of the earlier arrived heads had set up this Dark Hollow camp scene. I probably delt with the other reviewer who played tunes with his bros up on that hill. There were maybe 200+people up there before it got dark, and by 7Am the Carnival was in full effect.Talk about it gettin' Stranger, my compadre ate his 'chicklets' awful early that morning. We really could'nt tell how many people were there until we came off that hill. HO! This was as big a croud as...well, there was a Sea of people. And, it was 95degrees if not 100. Beautiful girls everywhere, some topless; and the most lack security I've ever seen. They had the lifts running so people could ride that Summer Luge track. What a trip those guys riding that thing! When the boys did finnally key it up, I remember there being a break in the middle of the first set for like what seemed like a lifetime. Altitude they say. The tapers were really edgy, and we were really high. The sound system on this show was weak but the TRIPPER capped it real well . This show lives in infamy for me and several others. This recording makes this show sound a WHOLE LOT BETTER. Speakers were going off and on randomly, and that buzzing sound..Check out the Chula Vista show in September for quality \"SATISFying\" sound. All in all, All-Time; a winner. (Which, to some, might sound like an All-Time Winner...Two different things.) Some say that this was the worst show ever.

The drums are so out of synch on BUCKET that it is likely they couldn't hear anything properly.\n\nOtherwise, the energy level is moderately okay and not abysmmal, as was the case at so many shows in the last few years and even at times in the late 70s.\n\nSo, not a keeper by any stretch of the imagination, but definitely not deserving the title of WORST SHOW EVER!",

Intense heat, winds that kicked up dust clouds,  traffic blocked for hours; the show was tough on the crowd. The band fared poorly with equipment problems, and the PA was intermittent for the crowd as well (this is unapparent on the SBD). The dirt, sweat, and hot wind, combined with the long, long traffic jam must have turned the clean into bearded wooks. Lots of shows were handled poorly in the 70s/80s by grassroots-mean-wells. In the high altitude sun guitars go out of tune fast (7k isn't that high unless you're from sea level and in very poor shape. It's low for skiers, and musicians in places like Peru play at twice this elevation). Both sets were during the heat of the day. I remember people at the Red Rocks run (@6355', fwiw; Sante Fe Downs was 6243' and Reed's/CoSprings was 6550') talking about what a slumblefuck disaster the show had been and how the band seemed to be laboring (and pointing out the dust, Bobby kicking his amp across the stage, Phil cussing, Jer dripping sweat and the getting-stuck-for-hours-in-their-car). I was glad I'd skipped-out, and nobody traded the tape BITD.\n\nBut, nope, this isn't the worst show ever, as has been pointed out (there are many worse shows than this in '94/'95 alone). It DOES, however, have one of the worst 1st sets ever. Overall it's better than I thought from the legend, in fact there's a <i>classic Dead turn-around</i> in the second set.\n\n Part of the fun is that the listening experience is subjective. DorkDuckler (below) says we all saw worse - but I didn't (almost, in 94/95). Cryptical70 notes superb drumming - even though they spend half the show out of sync. I like Roebuck's succinct, retroactive warning \"I would have hated to bring a first-timer to this show\". I dig all the opinions for this show (especially those who say it's the worst show ever...and then rate it 4 stars anyway!). It's perplexing, though, how some people hear this show and make the gaping logic-fail that there were therefore no good shows in the mid-80s, when there were amazing shows even less than two weeks later at Red Rocks. Equally, some pretend there weren't bad shows in '66 -'71. There were dozens worse than this show in that era as well. '87 and '90 were top years and both Weir and Kreutzmann list Spring '90 as faves. I didn't see a real miff show until '94. '85 was a good year and this second set - average for '85 - would have been above average for '94-'95.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Alabama Getaway</i> comes off fine, albeit with a warm-up vibe. It's as good as the set gets. The play is then shaky with near-consistent amp, monitor and PA problems. There's a spark to <i>West LA Fadeaway</i> that suggests it would have gone over without the electronic difficulties. When <i>Minglewood</i> doesn't gel, combined with the other problems it's a trainwreck. <i>Friend of the Devil</i> = Ouch! <u>Nobody</u> is making the right choices. Obviously the stage monitors are off and they can't hear either each other or themselves. <i>Hell in a Bucket</i> = Yikes! The set has become even worse. Everybody is playing as if they want the others to come to him. <i>Dough Knees</i> is marginally better.\n\nSecond Set. After a long break (some say two hours?!) they returned with a fine <i>Feel Like a Stranger</i> and then: Dead turnaround magic! Obviously they went somewhere cool, rested, let the crew fix the shit, huddle and hike. Though it could just as often fall apart, here it gets put back together. <i>China Cat</i> is a speed version but it's hard to play/sing it at this tempo. When Jer jumps out the band follows. It gets hotter and hotter. One of the frustrating things about '93-'95 was sluggish tempos. Well here's a lightning-paced <i>Rider</i>. The drummers are forced to four-on-the-floor <u>which puts them in sync</u>, finally. Jer probably intended just that when he took off so fast (Kreutzmann says that Jer often became annoyed with the Shoes In the Dryer\u2122 and would tweak the tempo). Sounding more '82-'83-ish, it's skin-of-the-pants, like it's about to careen into the mountainside but then skiffs the ridgetop and splits the lone cloud puff. <i>He's Gone</i> is likewise stellar - listen to the boys' interplay behind the solo. A few lead-ins are tentatively tested but it's off to <i>Drums</i> which are '89-ish (i.e. better than yr average '85). The rest is average-to-shaky, returning to slop city by <i>Around & Around</i>, the drummers again messing everyone up and more equipment problems. <i>Day Tripper</i> is listed as an Encore but you can hear that they go straight into it from <i>Lovelight</i>. It's the last of five and just a throwaway they goofed around with - ostensibly not intending to really nail it.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>:  \u00a0F\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 2 Stars\n\nHighlights:\nI Know You Rider - the turnaround in this show is actually a fine example of Dead magic\nHe's Gone - it's cool that in a mostly stinker there's a top version of '85\nDrums - inventive for '85\n\nSOURCES:\nNow there's a miller.106195 that sounds great.",

      "review_text": "A Day In The Dirt W/The Dead I was at this show. AAA rated--for all of the distressed motorists whose cars that littered the side of I 80 from Kingvale to Boreal Ridge proper--and sure enough, the show was a mechanics special. Im anxious to listen to the archive--the thought of actually seeking out a tape of this show at the time was never even considered. \n\nI remember this much--The August weather was clear and fucking hot, the venue a dust bowl, and the band-despite the technical problems, The Trouble with Bob, and Garcia's apparent desire to punt at every opportunity--as mutinous(sic) as they seemed to be in the moment, remained on deck and went down with the show like the lost sailors they have been known to be.\n\nHard to identify the worst show ever--photographs of Garcia \"playing\" his guitar while looking at his shoe/possibly thinking Taco Bell after any typical 1990's show would help in any case--\n\nBut it doesn't matter. Shows like Boreal Ridge remind us of 2 important things- \n\nFirst: Like AAA, the boys would invariably take us to places we might otherwise never consider--whether they be majestic or mundane.\n\nSecond: Shows Like Boreal Ridge sefrve to remind us why the killer shows are so killer, and why any of us was willing to endure countless renditions of INSERT YOUR LEAST FAVORITE SONG HERE, or several nights of shitty or marginal shows in order to arrive at a gem/chestnut/homerun whatever. The First Mardi Gras show w/Neville Brothers comes to mind.\n\nA Day In The Dirt is a small price to pay.",

      "review_text": "not the worst ever....... I don't know what the worst ever is but this show has ups and downs. Some of the playing is irradic. However some of it is very interesting. The West L.A. is very trippy but seems to have some horn type sound which could be mechanical issues. The Hell in a Bucket starts out with issues where drums is off with the string section but it eventually tightens up. Stranger starts out disjointed but eventually smokes pretty good. \n\nTo TAMEDTURTLE- I have a hard time with people like you. Ya you did say \"few\" which shows how ignorant you are. I went to like 100 shows in the 90's. There is great stuff there too. For example: RFK 91. The whole band is on and having a great time of it. I can picture you going up to Jerry during Jack-a-roe (where Bruce rips off a solo that has Jerry looking at him and nodding in approval)or Big River or Maggies Farm or during the Help>Slip> Franklins where Jerry is beaming and I can see you trying to stop the band from playing and I can see you telling Jerry to put his guitar down and I can see you saying \"Jerry and the Dead, you have to stop playing right now and forget that you are having a ball and playing some awesome music, and forget that everyone watching is stunned and will walk out of here dazed with what they just saw, and forget that in a few minutes you will play a beautiful encore called Baby Blue, and the reason you have to stop is cause its 1991 and you guys suck now and your not making any good music anymore\"......ya your a joke and I have a hard time with \"heads\" like you. UGH......\n\nThis show is not that bad. The China Rider is tight........find your moments.......3 stars......",

      "review_text": "They came, they saw, they... didn't play so well Well, based on its rep as the worst performance of the eighties I had to listen to this show. It's not the worst show of all time, I think that one might be the 1969 show (can't remember the date) at a highschool, or perhaps one of the stinkers from '95, but this show is indeed a disaster. I believe that technical/mechanical problems were to blame for most of this mess. For instance Bobby had some equipment problems that caused the band to stop several times between songs for several minutes. You can hear the others in the band ask him what's wrong. For whatever reasons the band are just way off and play as though they couldn't hear each other very well so maybe there were monitor issues as well?\n\nThis show is remarkable in that it contains the worst Friend of the Devil I've ever heard and there are some other real clunkers. They try to start Truckin' at least three times coming out of Space and eventually it staggers to its feet and shambles along before almost completely falling apart during the jam section. The drummers just seem to lose the beat. Even Drums is a cloudy conflation of flailing rhythms and foggy beats thay rarely gels. He's Gone is just brutal. And yet despite all the problems there are a few gems here. West LA Fadeaway has some nice Jerry guitar and the China/Rider is taken at a blistering tempo almost twice as fast as normal and it smokes! All in all though this show is more amusing than anything else. Everybody has an off performance and considering how well the guys played for much of '85, it's easy to forgive and forget this high altitude debacle. Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile!",
