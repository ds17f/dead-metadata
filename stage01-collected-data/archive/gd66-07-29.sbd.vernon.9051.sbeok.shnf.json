This was (obviously) a huge growth period and they were really pushing the envelope as for as what they could do eltronically. Interesting how they distribute the different tracks to right and left speakers. I can tell the vocals are where most of the hiss is coming from. Probably could write a thesis on this stuff. Kinda moot once you figure that a ton of our \"modern\" sound technology was coming from these early ventures. Its alive!  Also, if you listen to the cream puff war ( and then go check on any of Phil & Friends jams of late, you can tell Phil is really trying emulate this period. Quite well too!",

Bob may be low in the mix, but the other guys, especially Pigpen and Jerry are tearing it up. Pig's early organ playing is a delight, he was really good and with Jerry is the main instrumental voice in the band. The real surprise here tho are two songs I'm not that familiar with: You Don't Have To Ask and Cardboard Cowboy. Both are excellently played examples of mid sixties psychedelic rock. I think Cardboard Cowboy may have been played at one other show. The crowd are either lame or not miked as they're barely audible and it sounds like there may be 10 people in attendance. For example the band do a great ripping version of You Don't Have To Ask that stops on a dime after a great Jerry solo and there's\u2026 silence, well one clapper anyway. WTF?!",

      "review_text": "Teflon donut <br />This was part of the Trips Festival at Hastings Park, and their first show out of the U.S. (ultimately there were 32 to 35 shows in Canada). The festival was based not on the bands so much as a concurrent 52-projector light &amp; film show. Phil later said this show was \"one of the worst performances I can remember.\" Jer said the festival was badly run, worsened by the reserved and quiet audience and the one-set slot, and commented that the next weekend was much better [a tape we don't have]. It's funny that Jer thought this gig was horrible and Phil thought they stunk. They were their own worst enemies. Bear's tapes at the time put all vox in one channel and recorded little to no audience. Previously, the tapes for the 29th &amp; 30th were switched, but the banter and announcements [as well as the OFF release] show the 29th setlist as<b>:</b>\nStanding on the Corner\nI Know You Rider\nNext Time You See Me\nSittin\u2019 On Top of the World\nOtis on a Shakedown Cruise (don't have to ask)\nBig Boss Man\nStealin'\nThe Monster (cardboard cowboy)\nIt's All Over Now, Baby Blue\nCream Puff War\nViola Lee Blues\nBeat it On Down the Line\nGood Morning, School Girl\n\nFirst Set. <i>Standing on the Corner</i> is the best of the three we have, as well as the final one. \"I'm just trying to save some face\" isn't a phrase you hear anymore. <i>I Know You Rider</i> is one of the best examples of the earliest arrangement. I gotta wonder what people thought of Jer's playing here; was it recognized as unique? Some of the picking you hear in <i>Sittin\u2019 on Top</i> would later turn up in Cumberland. Note that before <i>You Don't Have to Ask</i>, the band calls it <i>Otis</i> (the sixth of seven we have and also the best). Sit on a potato pan, Otis! <i>Big Boss Man</i> probably has the tightest playing of the set. <i>Stealin'</i> was a set piece in '66, though we only have five. This and the <b>Historic Dead</b> version (from Nov./Dec.) are best. According to Phil's book (and occasional mic chatter), the next one is titled <i>The Monster</i>, but tape collectors jotted down \"Cardboard Cowboy\" (from the opening verse). Again, the best of three we have and the last one. Bobby liked to introduce it as No Left Turn Unstoned (sounds like this isn't the first time), and they discuss whether that's an anagram, calliope, spoonerism or palindrome. It's none of those things. It's a pun or a pseudoprofundity. A spoonerism would be Leave no turn unstoned. Anagrams are<b>:</b> Tenfold neutron stun; Lost nun rented futon; TNT unroofed tunnels;  Teflon donut stunner. Calliope is a Greek goddess (and a muse). I hid a palindrome a dozen sentences ago. <i>Baby Blue</i> is solid enough but lacking shine. <i>Cream Puff War</i> is the set's big jam, and is already different than the beginning of the month. This was the big vehicle for the second half of '66 (along with earlier jam, Viola Lee). We only have 7 from '66 and one from Mar. '67, but this is an especially good early version from Jer. His second solo is over 5mins and Billy is already in '68. Even if it's not quite as advanced as the one on the reels labeled 12/1, it's a better recording.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Viola Lee</i> is the  last we have of this exact arrangement, though it's pretty standard; not quite 7/3 but still evolving. After a <i>Beat it on Down the Line</i>-7 is the third <i>Good Morning, School Girl</i> that we have (of 6 in '66). It's solid enough, so too bad we don't have the ending [it's missing about 4mins]. Here we are likely missing a Minglewood or a Dancing.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n \nHighlights:\nStanding on the Corner \u2013 best of three we have\nI Know You Rider \u2013 great early arrangement, Jer's playing an indicator of '69+\nOtis on a Shakedown Cruise (You Don't Have to Ask) \u2013 historical interest; best we have\nStealin' \u2013\t'66 set piece\nThe Monster (Cardboard Cowboy) \u2013 see Otis\n\nSOURCES: The sbd_2243 has the 1st set. The vernon_9051 has all but the last two and has been pitch corrected. The GEMS_94631 has the entire show, including the last two, but is marked 7/30 and runs slightly slow, <u>needing +1% pitch correction</u>. The 50th anniversary edition of <b>The Grateful Dead</b> has the show as does the vinyl <b>July 29, 1966</b>. These releases <u>need +1%</u> pitch.",
