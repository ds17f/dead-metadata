The previous night the Dead arranged for a ferry boat so they could jam all night.  Hendrix never showed up, later explaining that he had met a woman, dropped acid and fucked all night.  So on this night, Hendrix showed up at the Avalon looking for another chance to play with the Dead.  Ungrateful of Jimi's previous nights mischevious no show, the Dead granted Jimi a stage jam but never motioned him to come on, essentially playing through their set without welcoming Jimi onstage to jam.  I'm sure his presence backstage lit up the Dead in more ways then one.",

Decent \"Dark Star\", nothing to write home about but nice nonetheless.  \"St. Stephen\" is played at the perfect pace, and \"The Eleven\" cooks like I haven't heard before.  Jerry really goes after it on \"Death Don't Have No Mercy,\" you rarely get vocals like this anywhere else. Nice \"That's It For The Other One\" with early Phil singing along during the chorus, probably my favorite version - like others have said, it hits hard.  The jam that finishes the show brings to a close what must have been a fun night.  Great sound quality on this one, especially for '68 - definitely my favorite single-disc show.  Get it now.",

It is the most solid dead show from start finish that i've yet downloaded.  I think the sound quality is warm and beautifully fuzzy.  The Dark Star is more than decent!  It is a great Dark Star...and the earlier St. Stephen is especially tonic - just one clearly more beautiufl note after the other into the Eleven.   One of my favorite Eleven's yet.  Death Don't Have No Mercy makes it obvious that Jerry was no southern blues singer :) BUT beyond that his blues guitar is right on the money - like something you would hear out of Duane Allman.  Great stuff and the rest of the cd is especially chill..just a great ending of the show that forces you to start it over again.  But again i must say this Dark Star is exceptional.  Listen to the guiros lol - and i hear a couple playin' in the band teases.  Five star recording and show.",

      "review_text": "Review revision 5/29/05 This show is just one of those that never gets old on you, no matter how many times you listen to it. The 15-minute Dark Star is possibly the finest circulating pre-Live Dead version, and though it lacks the adventurism of later versions, it nevertheless establishes a trippy musical landscape that always characterizes the best of Dead jams, segueing into an early St. Stephen. \n\nOf course, the That's It suite is a beast, but of special mention here is The Eleven, which is the best version ever, bar none. The band, particularly Jerry, is so tight and intense that they might as well have been driving over a cliff when they played it. Every nook and cranny of this Eleven is flawless, and it hasn't been matched before or since. The only other Eleven (this is IMO, of course) that comes close is the fragmentary 2/2/69 version. \n\nIn Potato, the singing is lackluster as usual, but as soon as Phil's bass solo and the 13/8 jam starts, you will forgive the vocal shortcomings so fast you won't even remember that they sang. The jamming around the bass solo is just so gorgeous. Then out of nowhere comes a drums>jam>feedback segment. The Jam has strong Caution and Alligator  teases, but is never really based upon a single theme; the Dead have to come up with one one their own and that's what they do best; with the exception of the following night, this transition was never made again. Why? It was a spur of the moment thing, something that characterizes the best Dead jams.\n\nNow as for sound quality, this is the best damn sounding live recording I have ever heard of a Dead show and I have been collecting tapes for 10 years. Hyperbole, you wonder? It's not. I have SBDs from the (ill-fated) year of '95 that don't sound as good as this one. Along with Greek Theatre 10/20/68, the sound on these two shows is so good that I have wondered if they were secretly recorded by their label for a possible live release. They would have made a classic live album, no doubt. This is one of the best-ever Dead shows, and the finest of '68 (apologies to 6/14). This gets five stars easy.",

      "review_text": "Epic Early Dark Star This would be a definitive Dark Star for Garcia's work in the first five minutes alone. Beautifully uptempo, Jerry floats with dynamic mastery over some fine Weir rhythm guitar and a stellar Lesh foundation. Really good percussion here as well; the cool wish-wash effect was mentioned below, I believe. The absence of a keyboard presence gives Jerry a bit more space, in my opinion. It also gives keyboardists a chance to improvise over this tune, something I have taken the liberty to do a few times. While not as spacey or exploratory as later versions, people (particularly guitarists and other musicians, though it is not limited to them) will be attracted to Garcia's unique stream of musical thought, which really shines through on this particular show. The quick pace forces him to be more melodic, as he can no longer rely on a triplet run to serve as a buffer between ideas. Remarkable stuff.",

In the introduction, the editors make a point of saying that many tapes labeled with various dates from 68-69 are actually 10-13-68.  The music and talking identifies this show as the same one I have on an old, hissy tape (although I suspect the Caboose may be from a different show).  Since 10-13-68 must have been a widely circulating tape, I suspected this show is 10-13.  Can anyone answer this?\n\nHaving said that, this is an awesome recording of a mind-melding show.  The Eleven is certainly one of the best, but check out the jam out of drums after Caboose.  It rips with hints of TOO and a definite Caution riff from Phil before dissolving into crazy feedback (which by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the later Phil and Ned noise.  Feedback in 68-69 MOVED and dissolved brains.)\n\nEdited 1/28/10:  I now think that the Other One suite at this show is among the best -- especially the Cryptical reprise.  Better even than Harpur's, if I dare say so.",

Every song is played with soul and a fire the Dead rarely matched or surpassed and the jamming is extraterrestrial. The show starts with Darkstar which isn't as explorative as it would later become but it has a marvelous wistful soulfullness that makes for a trancendent listening experience. Follow that with my favorite version of The Eleven. I mean it's the best I've heard. The interplay between Bill K., Phil and Mickey is amazing but it's Jerry's guitar playing that makes this just so goddamn good. This is an Eleven for the ages. Death Don't is wonderful. The following Cryptical, Other One, New Potato Caboose, jam, drums, Feedback is a stunning seamless flow. The emphasis in this show is not the songs but the jamming and transitions. If that's your cup of tea (it's mine) you will love this show. The vocals are a little weak in places, but the instrumental interplay is outstanding. The icing on the cake, and what a cake, is the sound quality: crystal clear and despite some variations in volume and mix it's really really good. As another reviewer pointed out it sounds as though Warner Brothers taped this show for a potential live album? In any case as one audience member yells out during a lull between songs \"Thankyou Mr. Garcia!\" I have this show on old crusty cassette and Jerry says before Darkstar \"It's time to leave your bodies everyone!\" or something to that effect. That's missing from this show, maybe my cassette was labeled wrong? Oh well, thanks Archive.",

And then I burned it onto a disk, so it's just one album focusing on New Potato Caboose.\n1. Description: this is the lyric section with Bob singing.\n2. Cumulonimbus: this is...you guessed it- Phil's solo. His bass playing always makes me think of dark thunderclouds.\n3. Hail / Sudden Shouts / The End Is Near: New Potato has always made me think of the end of the world and track 3 is the drum solo. I like to think of as hail or maybe rocks from space landing on the earth and the cheers from the audience are the people on earth screaming.\n4. Impact: this is the end of the world. The first part, with Jerry playing a Caution like solo, is the spreading of the fire, the fire making it's way to a bigger climax. All of a sudden, the jam is more like Going Down The Road and I like to imagine aliens in their spaceships watching the earth explode in a fiery cataclysm.\n5. Aftermath: this is the feedback section. Just listen to it and imagine the remains of earth floating through cold dark space.\n\nAt only 22 minutes, it's the shortest \"album\" I've ever created but  I'm satisfied. Dark Star is also beautiful. The 1st Cryptical is not the best to my ears just because of the first several seconds missing. The Other One is probably the 3rd best, the 1st being the one from Harpur College and the second being the one from So Many Roads. The Cryptical Reprise here is the best I have heard along with Two From The Vault. The drum solo is the weakest song here as there is much hesitation on Mickey's part.",

The Alligator sets the tone for what is just a great and seriously extended set one. <a href=\"https://8ball-pool.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">8 ball pool</a> online\nI am actually listening to the Miller soundboard so not commenting on the sound for this recording.\nI do like the Spanish Jam it is the lead-up to all those cowboy tunes that they would eventually cover.\nLove the way they roll into the Dark Star!",

Those of you who are open to suggestions, I've saved links for a couple other versions which, though not having the amazing sound quality of this show, will still blow you away. These are personal favorites of mine, guaranteed to get all of your psychedelic juices flowing!\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd68-11-01.sbd.cotsman.18100.sbeok.shnf/gd68-11-01d1t01.shn     for the Other One\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd1969-02-21.sbd.miller.111780.flac16/gd69-02-21d1t05.flac      for The Eleven\n\nWith both of these, you need to crank up the volume to get all the sonic details.",
