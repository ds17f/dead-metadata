The recording is decent, not outstanding or anything else, the performance is average to slightly above average.  Really impressive Jack Straw that would have been stellar if Jer could have kept the tempo to the end of his last solo.  Let it Grow is long and solid.   Truckin' has a nice bomb drop in it, watch the speakers.  UJB's has lyrical flubs that are cringingly funny, almost seemed on purpose listening to it now, didn't get that feeling live.  Standing is strong as is IWTTY and Sugar Mags.  Overall decent but there are much better fall shows that can be picked up if you're just browsing.  I give it a 3 and a half.",

The location, middle of nowhere Vermont in a town that was NOT set up to deal with 20K deadheads. Sounds like I'm some sort of anal retentive yuppy, but I'm actually not. The port-a-potties were on the edge of the dustbowl, I mean field, and so people just pissed where they stood, which added a 'nice' touch... Anyway, the music also sucked despite a 10 day rest period.  Let the Good Times Roll was pretty solid as was Jack Straw, but Corrinna and Way to Go Home were throw-aways.  I left 1/2 way through the 2nd set (never did that before!) but I heard that Standing on the Moon was decent.  I love the Dead and love these outdoor venues, but this was a really bad location.  Phish would try it (successfully) a few years later...\nOxford Plains Speedway 1987 - now that was an AWESOME venue for a summer show!",

One Garcia lyric flub during Uncle J, but otherwise outstanding, high energy playing. Truckin> Speedway was tasty indeed. Best Corrina I have in my collection.

Now the venue & scene were pretty sweet, the security went AWOL and joined the hippies for this one. Much like the woodstock a few weeks later. It was nice to be \"in the middle of nowhere\" with no cops pepper sprayin us kids for havin fun(like meadowlands 2 weeks later). I don't know tho, maybee it was that long trffic jam heading in, or the heat but we just were'nt feeling the music this nite. I'm not to anal usually but this was the true begining of the end I thought...... Then came Boston & NYC in Oct.  ;-)",

This was a great time but as I recall this was sort of a weird environment. \n I always wanted to see the Dead outdoors in VT. I had just seenthe shoreline run weeks earlier and it was hot. This show left me tripping my balls off whatching jerry on the big screen- and the music although not my favorite list, was hot. \n\nJerry's licks on Jack straw rock as does the whole first set basiclly. Yeah, it was 89 degrees and humid and Jerry was tired but the show is worth the download because it characterizes a time period for the dead very well. Not to mention the greaaat soundboard quality. Jerry sounds like he is picking with a needle or a nail or soemthing..his leads are PHENOMENAL>\n\nIt gets 5 stars for sound but really only 3 stars for performance.",

We drove up from Rhode Island and had a blast in the lot and met lots of cool people.My buddy got interviewed by the local paper. It was a hot summer day and there were plenty of baloons and other stuff around to entertain. I'd seen the band 50+ times so I know a good show from a bad one. This was a bad one. I've never been so disinterested. It kind of dawned on me towards the end of the first set that it was kind of over for them. We left right after the drums.It was a sad sad day for me. I didn't stop going, I hit the run of garden shows and even came back to Highgate in 95.It had just been slowly declining for a few years and this was it. I've never gone back and listened to the tapes.Sorry to be such a bummer. I've since been rejuvenated by Ratdog and I am very enthusiastic again.Where's my time machine?",

Not clipping, but there is some digi-noise from SOTM through US Blues.  Still worth downloading this.  The clarity is pretty amazing overall.  Man do I miss Jerry.

The Dead were finally coming back to Vermont for the first time since I started seeing them in '85!  I knew in my heart that a summer tour show in the middle of nowhere would be a real trip for the locals in that little border town, but had high hopes that the raucus fan behavior that started to find our beloved band back in or around 1987 wouldn't follow them to such a pristine spot - (ha!).\n     True to what the fan base had become - this show was plagued with destruction- Fences knocked down (at a show where people were giving away tickets by the handful), overturned (and smashed) port-o-potties, trash everywhere (what ever happened to bring it in / take it out?), and of course, the infamous \"forest fire\".  \n     I was truly amazed they were allowed back in '95, but thinking about it later - I do understand how despite the destruction, the weak northern VT economy would embrace the financial boon of 90k+ Deadheads visiting.\n     The show started great, a strong first set - The second set lost steam and fell apart after drums - (no wonder - I would have a hard time playing my heart out with a forest fire raging 200 yards off of stage right!)  I recall watching the blaze grow, and sadly shaking my head, growing nervous and depressed at what seeing a Dead show had become.",

Picnic by the cemetary.... mellow scene about 1/3 of the way back on the field.....  too bad '95 went to hell the way it did.....\n\nUpdated review on 7/13/18:   Cannot believe this was 24 years ago!!!  Where does the time go?!?!?!  Anyway, listening for the first time in a long time....For the most part, much as I recalled...  Jerry still standing upright instead of hunched over during leads..... always loved the Good Times Roll opener.... Jack Straw was great.... rest of 1st set was pretty solid.....  Then again, I'm a sucker for Queen Jane, Loser and Tennessee Jed :)~     2nd set started well, but then came the two headed show killer known as Way to go Home and Corrina.   Space and drums were interesting, but by this time they were both too long.... more a second break for Jerry and a long bathroom break for the crowd..... I Want to Tell You made for a nice novelty.... like the Last Time's they played.... If they had gone into Watchtower or some other jamming Bobby tune, would have been a nice piece of filler.... but by 1990, that's what Miracle had been.... a way to fill 4 minutes.....  Thankfully Jerry put things straight with Standing on the Moon before doing the show ending rock out with Sugar Mag and Useless Blues.....   All in all..... had a helluva time.  Such a chill day and night.....  Just wish they'd played almost anything other than that two headed show killer.....    I am bumping it from 3 to 4 stars.... for no reason other than I really had a great time..... not that I ever had a bad time at a Dead show [even during the tour from Hell in 95] because I was always with friends.... some of which I still text with most every day [including a college buddy I met in September 1977].....   And as always..... Even on the worst night, I'd give a lung to hear Jerry one more time!!",

It was also completely overshadowed by a kick ass show that Phish played the same week in Sugarbush.

Some good moments to be sure, but not enough to make up for the rest of it. I remember how Bobby wore his sunglasses throughout the show and just seemed to be goin' through the motions. Even Sugar Mag was empty.  Something was up with the band. Either they were out of it, or they didn't like the scene. If the latter was the case, who could blame them? I was a newbie to GD and Phish when this concert took place, but even I could feel the friction between people who were there primarily for the music, and those who were there primarily to get as wasted as possible and enjoy the \"scene.\" It seemed like a bunch of people who just wanted background music for their drug fest had begun showing up to Phish and GD shows, and this did not sit well, as both bands are known for passionate, loyal, music-intelligent fans. Also, the choice in drugs started to switch from Pot and Hallucinogens, to Coke and pharmaceuticals.  The vibe from people who used the latter drugs was hollow and disturbing. Sorry for the rant, but I honestly feel that it affected the playing.",

As a jazz guiatrist I can have some bad nights, but nothing like a bad night of Jerry's in the early to mid nineties. I just can't understand how one can be that out of it.

I have to agree, the scene was pretty disappointing -- a lot of loud, wasted jerks who talked and yelled through all the music, even when the music was good.  The show itself was pretty lackluster.  It had a few moments.  They did some tunes I'd always wanted to hear -- somehow I'd never seen them do Althea or Truckin', and both turned up this night -- but all in all it was pretty floppy.  \n\nOddly enough, the last show I saw was the Shoreline one reference a couple of reviews below, with the badly-played Unbroken Chain.  I read something interesting a while back, Bruce Hornsby theorizing that Jerry was losing a lot of manual dexterity in the last couple of years, probably having more to do with diabetic-related circulation problems or chronic use / repeat stress issues (i.e. carpal tunnel type stuff) than with drug use.  That would make some sense ... although there were also some times he seemed pretty out of it in terms of remember lyrics, which verses he'd already sung, etc.\n\nAnyway ... yeah, it was not a pretty ending for my favorite band.

Corrina jams are very creative, with Jerry even throwing in a tease to his Alligator solo from Anthem of the Sun.
