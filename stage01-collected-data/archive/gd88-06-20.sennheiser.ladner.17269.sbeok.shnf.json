NOT This will sound like I'm stealing Phil's lines from his interview in \"The Grateful Dead Movie.\"\n\nDuring the show itself, I just couldn't find my happy place.  It seemed like work, or forced, or maybe just the heat.  I remember storming out quickly after the nights work was done, thinking I never wanted to tape another show.  Two nights later, of course, back doing more of same.\n\nListening to the tapes, they were wonderful.  The Jack Straw opener was heartfelt from the first notes.  This is a wonderful performance of it to get to know really well.  \n\nPhil plays that big, warm, wooden roof at Alpine so well, and the Box shows it off.  Again, there is a feeling to this show ... far more intimate, say, than the \"Downhill From Here\" show a year later.  (Which by the way, sucks ... NOT.)\n\nHighlight ... Cassidy.  This one is better than sex.  Brent debuts Blow Away.  \n\nAnother fine example of why the Summer 1988 tour was so highly regarded.  \n\nThe roof at Alpine IS boomy ... and on these nights, the guitars sounded driven.  And the Wisconsin crowd shows that they can whoop it up with the best of the East Coasters.\n\nBurn the first set onto a CD now and play it over and over, you won't be disappointed.",

      "review_text": "TBC...it's less snobbish 1st Set: 68 seconds of excited crowd/tuning precede a patient \"Jack Straw.\" Bobby's not quite ready for prime-time but everyone else sounds strong. Nothing tantamount to breathing, but strong nonetheless. Everyone's feeling good that the boys are back on stage, why not indulge with \"Box\". Arm around another, and sing-along... The intro of \"West LA\" is feeling awfully 'Minglewoodish' in its approach although it's not as dance-floor loose. Hearty stuff. \"Memphis Blues\" feels earlier than usual, but Bobby's dramatics/emotional pleas mostly ring true. Things grow somber, but no less thrilling with \"Loser.\" \"Cassidy\" adds excitement to my bones adding a titilating jam midway through that climaxes twenty seconds too early. \"Ease\" ends this first set with perky aplomb.\n\n2nd Set: Well, you finally make your first appearance. A direct encroachment of dread. this \"Victim\" guarantees throw every virgin in the 40,000 audience heads. \"Cumberland\" isn't amazing but good vibes as is evidenced by the audience applause after the final chorus and the imagined smiling. \"Blow Away\" is stymied by Brent's lack of a confident presentation though its debut could hardly be called a failure. \"Ship\" oy...but Jerry's true to each line. \"Truckin\" breathes a purposeful groove but lacks depth besides a few Jerry lines here and again. The band is in that zone where everything sounds smooth and easy...\"Terrapin\"  \"Drums\" and \"Space\" proceed cleanly...my goodness I'm lacking the burst of energy myself. The second half of the set is like professional above-average 'Dead' clockwork where the nooks and crannies have zero fuel leakages. They're in 'stadium-satisfier' mode...\"Wharf\" is the weakest of the bunch with \"Around\" standing out for serious chuggish and Bobby rapping silliness all throughout \"Good Lovin.\"",

      "review_text": "New tunes in the dust bowl Overall: same as night before: great show, okay recording.  AUD recording that i give a B for sound quality, but my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Camus regardless.  I was never a taper, but I suspect it was a tough venue to get a great AUD recording due to the boominess and large space under the roof.  \n\nThe scene: dust bowl.  The inside of the bus was getting filled with flies and dust and our collective funk wasn't making matters any better!  :-)  We were selling soda and juice and the heat was making for some brisk sales (what the f*ck, it's only a buck).  For this night, I hung out on the Phil side over by the level area where there was plenty of space to get my freak dance on, which from this night on became my standard spot for Alpine shows ('88, '89, and '98 Other Ones).  Two new songs on this night continued the new-tune-trend of the summer of 88.  By the middle of the tour we'd heard more new tunes than the band had put out in about a decade.  A few would evenutally fall away (Gentlemen, Start Your Engines and Believe it or Not, noteably), but others would become standards for years to come.  \n\nThe music: Set I: \"you keep us on the run\" ... POW! A decent Jack Straw that sounds like it's going to bowl you over and then backs off just slightly.  Box as second song?  Strange and awesome - was that just him trying to preempt the inevitable \"we want Phil\" chants?  Bobby puts some punch in a couple of lines in an otherwise unnoteworthy Memphis.  Loser is strong.  Others have noted that this is a strong Cassidy.  It is, but the drooling comments here maybe gave me too high expectations.  It's good, but not amazing.  \n\nSet II: Although this was technically the second Victim, for most people this was the first time they heard it (myself included).  I wasn't an immediate fan.  It wasn't until they started doing some creepy jams that I started to really warm to it.  This version is basic considering where they took it later (best in my book was 12/31/89 into Dark Star).  Cumberland has never been a fave of mine, but it definitely got the mood back on the positive side.  Then ... wah? another new song?? Jeez, these guys are just bringing it!  Brent's first Blow Away.  As a big Brent fan, I was psyched to hear this, and compared with Victim, Brent brings this hard and heavy - great little vocal improv section ending with \"if you ain't got love, you ain't got sh*t!!\"  The jam portion could have been better (and was, of course, in later versions) and Brent's vocals should have been a bit louder, but overall a great intro of this song.  Bobby gets some sympathy applause for not remembering Truckin lyrics.  Most expected drums after Truckin, but Jerry extends things with nice, but not particularly noteworthy, Terrapin.  A sparse Other One creeps out of space and then turns itself into a rockin/freaky number.  I find it hard to rate Other Ones, as (1) there are so many, and (2) they are often good in different ways.  Having said that, I think this is a really great one for this late 80s era.  Bobby does a nice old-school \"get the girl next to you\" rap in Good Lovin and ends the show with some high energy.  US Blues keeps the energy going for the encore, which was nice.",

Just when it seemed like it was starting to wind down, Mickey Hart started playing a timpani-like drum and running up the scale at a faster and faster speed.

The first set is strong if not earth shattering, highlights are Jack Straw, Box of Rain, Loser, and Cassidy.\nThe second half of the second set is the best part of the show, in my opinion (which is interesting, because the second half of the second set at the next show was awful). Everything is inspired and played with gusto and high energy (although The Other One could've been longer). This night and the final show were the best of this Alpine run, although it wasn't quite up there with Hampton in the spring, for example. That's not a knock, though. A real good late 80's show, and a good audience recording (especially for Alpine). A good one to get even if you weren't there.",

This show was just \"OK\", Jack Straw was nice, and I still remember the red, white and blue lights that ended U.S Blues. \n\nThe problem was the new material.  \"Victim\" was a dreadful experience before the midi years, and this one was no exception.
