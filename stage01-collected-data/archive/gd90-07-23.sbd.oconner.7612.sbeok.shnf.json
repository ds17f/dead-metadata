After almost 70 shows in 6 years, this was it for me. I felt that 89-90 was as good as it was every going to get and left feeling elated at what I had seen and heard. This show isn't the greatest, but it is a solid performance and an important one - the end of an era.",

      "review_text": "Boy, I miss Brent I couldn't make the first two shows of this run because of work, so I was happy to get up to Chicago to catch the last show of the tour. \n\nThis show gave me my best Grateful Dead memory. I had just broken up with my girlfriend at the time and had a bad attitude over it. My pals and I were 15th row center (the best seats I ever had at a Dead show). I really wanted to hear \"Good Times Blues\" (AKA \"Never Trust A Woman\") due to my mood. When Brent started the opening riff to the tune on the Hammond B-3, I was SO happy. I jumped up and screamed, \"AW, YEAH!!!\" and bounced around in sheer ecstacy.  Brent looked right at me...I mean RIGHT AT ME. Nobody else in my area was making that much of a commotion, so I know it had to have been me. I screamed, \"THANK YOU!,\" and he looked at me for a second or two, then bent his head back down and just played the song to death. I felt like he was playing it just for me. Little did we know just how much pain he was in.\n\nThe other thing I remember about this show was a guy in the row right behind us in a 3-piece suit. He just stood there the whole time. Didn't move, didn't smile, nothing. He wasn't bothering anybody, and nobody was bothered by him, but it was just...odd.\n\nTwo days later, Brent was dead of an overdose.\n\nGet this show. It's tight, well-played, and is an historic evening.\n\nBrent, you were the sh*t. I miss you.\n\nSean K.",

      "review_text": "Over-rated I can't believe the high ratings this show is getting. I was at this show and it wasn't very good. The reason wasn't the band, but the venue. Tinley Park sucked. There was a balcony built in to the amphitheatre building which acted like a sound baffle, causing the sound inside the building to bounce around all over the place. It sounded awful. The lawn sounded much better but was SO overcrowded that I could barely breathe, let alone move around. \nThe band, Jerry in particular, did not seem to be having a good time at this venue, particularly on this, the final night. Jerry looked miserable and to me it sounded like they all just wanted to get the show over with and go home.\nThe best evidence for this was the choice of Victim or the Crime to open the second set. I saw this entire tour and Bobby opened with this one one too many times. I think Jerry had no interest and so it was left to Bobby, and he didn't show much enthusiasm either. The Man Smart was competent but definitely the most uninspired version I have ever seen. It sounded like I was listening to the record. I'm not saying the Dead played poorly this night, just that the venue had finally got the best of them and their hearts just weren't in it. I would recommend either of the other two nights over this one. Better yet, get both the Deer Creeks shows, which were the high point of the tour for me. It's a shame that an otherwise brillian tour had to end this way, and that this was Brent's last show. It was no accident that the Dead never played Tinley again.",

Brent was awesome and I bet half of the deadheads did not realize this until Vince arrived.  Sure he sang alot of songs about love, women and relationships, but he still kicked ass.  Listen to the Blow Away from 4/15/89 or 3/26/90 and you'll know what I mean.  The Far From Me from 7/12/89 is pretty intense as well.  The 80's are one of my favorite decades of the Dead because of Brent!!\nIn terms of the show, it was a great way to end the summer tour.  I love the Nobody's Fault tease in the middle of Truckin and Smokestack.  The Foolish Heart is one of my favorites, along with the overplayed Women are Smarter.  Nice way to end Summer tour '90.

I was living in Concord in the late 80's and I used to go down to Devil Mountain Brewery, a place with live blues bands.  One night I saw Brent there alone, leaning against a post.  You think after seeing him for hundreds of hours I would have no doubt it was him, but even though I recognized him immediately, he had that \"everyman\" quality (the opposite of star power) that made me think, \"Maybe it's just some guy that looks like Brent.\"\n   I caught up to him and said he was a dead ringer for Brent Mydland and we had a laugh.  We chatted for a while, and he was always kind of looking around nervously.  But I got to tell him that it seemed like he took a lot of flak from Deadheads, yet everyone I actually knew thought he was terrific.  That's when he looked me in the eye and said, \"Thanks very much man, I really appreciate that.\"  \n   Brent was my favorite GD keyboardist by far and he got his due on occasion.  Know that.",

I'm suprised nobody else mentioned this, but the date of this concert was the tenth aniversary of Keith Godchaux's death. \nWe miss you Brent, may the four winds blow you safely home.\n\nAs for the show, it wasn't terrific, but it wasn't bad. The spring and summer tour of 1990 were, in my opinion, the strongest tours since 1977, despite Brent's vocal and musical decline during the summer tour.",

      "review_text": "Brent's last tour First, to the reviewer 'paintforbrains' or whatever way down below, Brent was most certainly NOT dead right after the show and \"Shipped Home With the Speakers.\"  What an ass.  I have photos of Brent boarding a helicopter both arriving and leaving that show - by himself - as he did on most if not all of the shows on that tour.  That was a sad and brutal tourfor many reasons - those of us who followed what was going on with the band members were aware that Brent was going through some really rough times with his wife and child, and that he'd benn inpatient in a clinic for depression until time came to leave for the tour - he was not one to let us down.  The songs that he broke out for that tour, a number of which he hadn't played in quite a while, made it pretty plain where his head was at, and those of us that truly loved him so for giving every last bit of himself - holding NOTHING back - seemed to be getting the message.  I and at least 25 people who had done the entire tour gave away our tickets that night.  I didn't know why at the time.  I traveled basically non-stop from Chicago to my personal place of healing - a private island in a bay on the North Shore of Lake Huron, so it was almost a week before I found out he'd gone (which was his right in my opinion,) and suddenly it made sense.  We gave away those tickets because we did not want to be a part of Brent's last show - maybe we knew somehow - and we just could not bear to say goodbye. not that way, in that huge concrete monstrosity.  Most of us had seen him hundreds of times, and we wanted to remember the Man at the height of his, um, 'thing'.  I think Brent's oft-played version of \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" was such a strong statement by Brent to show where he was at, and the band's adding a \"Hey Jude\" refrain to it was their way of sending him strength, love and power the best way they knew how - thru music.\n\nThe other reason that was a brutal tour was the one city - one travel day - one city format that went from Kenucky, to Pittsburgh, to Raleigh N.C., to D.C., to Freakin' Foxboro, to um someplace in New York state - ONE SHOW PER TOWN - I mean a LOT of folks ended up wrecking thier cars just trying to keep up, and they were not all like those fools in the Saab Turbo who'd made a fortune selling baloons in Foxboro, only to end up upside down next to the road late that night with the nitrous tank in the car with an oxygen mask attached...\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that, in my opinion, Brent was one of the top and most innovative Keyboard players and singers of his - or any - generation, Like Jerry, I continue to love his playing and singing, I view it as an unfathomably gracious, beautiful, and wisdom-filled gift - and I always will.  I feel blessed to have had him sheare so much of himself with me.  If Brent did anything wrong in his professional life it was that he gave us all of himself - so much that there was just nothing left to live on.  Sure, he had flaws - but let he/she among us who has none cast the first stone, eh?\n\nThought I heard a young man moan this morning... \n\n\nOh that was me. my knees are old.",

Everyone says the venue sucked, but I had a good time there (except for getting sick off a veggie burrito in the lot, but that's not the venue's fault) and probably wouldn't have made it to Alpine.  So I got 3 shows I wouldn't have otherwise.\n\n2.  The show has its moments (Cassidy, Truckin>Smokestack, Watchtower, Foolish) but overall is not that good.  Jerry tries to get the band going on Victim, but keeps starting his runs on the wrong note, throwing the others into confusion (Bob simply drops out at points).  Admittedly, soloing over the chromatic passages in that song is not easy, but check out 7/12/90 for example of how it's done.  Then Jerry has to repeat his solo in Terrapin because he screws up the finish.  A torrid Watchtower comes out of space but is followed by Yawning on the Lawn. That song was perhaps the only one that improved in 1995 as Jerry reliably played with intensity, but here, it's just a drag, a slow 3-chord song that takes forever to get to a so-so solo.  The rest is just standard. \nEither of the previous two nights was much better.  Especially 7/21.  \n\n3.  I don't think anyone, except maybe Brent himself, if it really was a suicide and not an accidental OD, had any idea what was about to happen.  ",
