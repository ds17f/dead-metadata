But again,the 2nd Set is where they get down to business. After a rare Cold Rain, they plunge into a seamless jam segue of Playin>Eyes>Estimated>Other One that's mind boggling! Plus an early Iko Iko and a beautiful Stella Blue. Something here for everyone. Another show that proves the Dead were on a roll in 1977.\nGuaranteed to bring a smile and get you kind!\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I just like Jerry's harder sound, and the jamming is insane.\n\nI've had the (very good) audience of this for 20 years, but the music loses absolutely nothing of the energy or intensity in the SBD version, and it does do away with the occasional crowd utterance (like the head who classically recognizes his buddy \"Krauser\" or \"Towser\" on the AUD at the beginning of a smoking Stella).\n\nThis is still my favorite Eyes from the period (even more than Englishtown), and the Stella>Playin is so crazy, words won't do it justice.  And--this is the Jones gang show.\n\nThe Aiko is a bit slow out of Drums, but that's like the only blot on an otherwise UNBELIEVABLE show.\n\nAnd it was COLGATE'S FRIGGIN HOMECOMING!!!!",

IMO this blows DP 34 out of the water. The Let it Grow is so intensen. I was sitting down at home folding laundry and and the peak hit, when Jerry is just furriously strumming his gityar, I could help but stand up and bust out my air gituar. GOOD STUFF. The Eyes is without a doubt my favorite version. The Other One is solid. Not the best one but we've all heard a lot worse. Stella always warms my heart and brings a tear to my but this on moves me more that other versions. No lack of enegry at all durring this show.\n\nThis show is a perfect example of why I LOVE THE GREATFUL DEAD(and Jerry). Download and enjoy.",

The energy between the band and the crowd was alive and the tempo all night was \"up\". Also, this was (according to DeadBase) the first time ever they played \"Eyes\" into \"Estimated Prophet\" instead of the other way around makes it even more special. Listen to that transition and it nothing like you've heard before!\n\nI too, wish it was a Dicks Picks over the following night, but, maybe soon?\n\nThink about it. But, only after downloading this show! \n-----------\nUpdate 8/10/05\nI originally posted this review on the Aud tape version. Both are a must! The AUD version has the complete Jones Gang Intro which the begining is cut on this Betty Board version. The Aud though not as clean picks up the energy that reverberated through the audience that night! \n\nThis version is incredibly clean too though the volume is a bit low.\n\nStill, this show is a must have. Been listneing to a bunch from '77 and this one stacks up with the best!\n\nBear in SC",

      "review_text": "G I heard about this concert from a friend at around midnight the night before.  4 of us drove all night from Providence.  As I recall, the Dead ended up playing this tiny gym on Colgate homecoming weekend only because the originally scheduled band (Rennaisance) canceled at the last minute.  Apparently the Dead were free that night and agreed to play for way less than their normal fee. Seeing the boys in such a small venue was truly unique (and quite a contrast the 150,000 at Englishtown, NJ on 9/3/77, my previous show).  The 1rst set is good, but things really catch fire with Let It Grow and keep smokin' until the end. The shows in fall '77 are hyper-energized with perhaps more risk taking than the \"exactly perfect\" performances of early 77.  Kudos to those who worked to make this material available!",

Because Jerry Moore was standing directly behind the soundboard when he taped this awesome show!  Is he the SHIT, or what?????\n\nI downloaded the soundboard, but after listening to Bertha and Good Lovin' (sounded a little muddled), I downloaded the aud songs, which blew me away!\n\nEvery time the Dead start a show with Bertha > Good Lovin\u2019 > BEW > Cassidy, you know it\u2019s a smokin\u2019 show!\n\nMay be the most energetic and best-sounding Sampson and Cold Rain and Snow I've ever heard!  This 2nd set just doesn\u2019t let up!  It is straight-away rock-n-roll until the end!  The Playin\u2019 > Eyes > Estimated > Other One is absolutely ridiculous!  This Eyes is one of the fastest, most jammin\u2019 Eyes I\u2019ve ever heard!  Garcia\u2019s guitar is on fire during this song!  No doubt the Dead excelled and thrived off the incredible intensity from the crowd in that small gymnasium.  You will be jammin\u2019 whether at home or in your car listening to this incredible show!\n\nEvery time I find a great show from 1977, then along comes another one (like 11/4) that just blows me away!  Most of my downloads are soundboards, but this aud is off-the-hook people!  Wish I could have been at these shows in 1977, but I was stationed overseas in Okinawa for most of the year, and then transferred to Yuma, AZ in late \u201977, when I was in the Marines.\n\nOh, and the Johnny B. Goode is the most incredible rockin\u2019 version I\u2019ve ever heard this band play!!  It\u2019s the fucking SHIT!!\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",

I was twelve in '77 , so I did not have the pleasure of checking the dead out live during this period. First shows were 8/7 & 8/8/82 at Alpine Valley. I feel that '77 was quite possibly the best year ever in terms of consistently strong performances over the course  of the whole year. What a seemless transition from Playin' to Eyes.... wow. GREAT SHOW. FYI , there are about 6 or 7 SBD's from '77 avaialable in the \"Free Stash\" at Nugs.net..... Enjoy",

      "review_text": "Almost incredible This week we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of a shit hot Fall \u201977 tour which contains very few, if any blemishes. Surrounded by shows that are all pretty much monsters in their own right, this one had a lot to live up to in my book. It was a totally blind first listen for me (with the exception of Eyes), which is why I ended up reviewing this bad boy right away. The mountainous terrain of this show is only overshadowed by the ridiculous precision they play with. This show is very unique and once again caught me completely off guard. Here goes nothin\u2019 ... \n\nWe start off with an innocently enough with a Bertha>GL combo, that pretty much takes off with Jerry\u2019s first solo and never looks back. I could tell immediately Jerry had a little extra jump in his game this evening by how fast he was pickin\u2019 out the gate. The transition into Good Lovin\u2019 was very nice and I would go so far as to say this is one of the best non-primal GL\u2019s I\u2019ve heard. Jerry is just burnin\u2019 shit up and the boys sound really freakin\u2019 tight tonight. Very nice job\u2026Pull up a chair boys and girls, because shit is officially on with the first few licks of BEW. MAN, are you kidding me? The time on this one is dead on and Jerry\u2019s soloing is lengthy, free-wheeling and just plain wonderful. Phil has a really punchy, full sound as well tonight which is accenting Jerry perfectly. This was also the first time I noticed Jerry\u2019s vocals \u2013 a little \u201cdifferent\u201d sounding. I put it in quotes because they sound more than a little odd, they sound a bit overdone. Next up is Cassidy, which straight UP fantastic from start to finish. Jerry starts weaving in and out of the percussive groove of this one almost immediately. Fast and furious, this one is done seemingly as quick as it lifted off. I was literally like WTF? 5 minutes man? Quitting on that fat-assed groove? Sheesh, that was great but also criminal \u2013 I mean to quit on it like that. The tune was rolling around my head in double helix fashion right up to the point that they closed it like the album version, no second time around and no slow landing either. It was like a perfectly played radio version or something. Precise and hard fought, and then closed right on the button. Weird. Roses and Sunrise come up next, and this was really a low point for the set imo. Jerry\u2019s vocals definitely sound a little shaky during Roses and I really do not care for Sunrise. Minglewood follows up those two and is really well done. Bobby sounds really good tonight, and Jerry is still crushing everything he plays. Incredibly precise. OK, so next up is the oddball of the night \u2013 Dupree\u2019s\u2026I still don\u2019t really know what I think of this one. I would definitely use one of my favorite descriptors \u2013 disjointed. I love Dupree\u2019s, but this one sounds off to me. It sounds like Jerry wants to play it faster really bad, yet Phil and Billy wont allow it. The vocals are definitely strainy and shaky at spots, and his soloing never really develops like the others have this evening. I love this tune, and I think this one doesn\u2019t really work. Weird\u2026.Alright, next up is the set-closing LIG and it is everything I wanted to be. Unlike any other tune from the first set, they sorta slip their way into this one like a pair of old comfortable jeans. Really enjoying the rhythm of this one as Jerry starts to really ramp this one up \u2013 and then at about the 330 mark, Jerry takes off again. This is one beautiful solo here. Totally unique. They slow it down just in time for another go round from Jerry, which really does not let up for the remainder of the song. MAN, Jerry is unleashing yet another mind bending solo blast that turns this jaw-dropper inside out. The really amazing part is the gentility this one floats in with, just as soft as could be and that is that. This cowbell laden LIG is one for the ages. Incredible way to close this mediocre first set. \n\nOK, so thoughts on the first set \u2013 Strange. Very intense, incredibly well played but impatient at spots. Jerry sounds loaded to me, but I just can\u2019t put my finger on it. He does not sound dosed and really doesn\u2019t sound blown out either \u2013 but off. What in the world can make you so incredibly focused yet sound so impatient at the same time. Ehh, who knows, I just know that set was as uneven as they come. Brilliant and boring, Im not even sure what I think so far. It definitely has my attention, and that is always a good starting point. \n\nThey start off with the great \u201cJones Gang\u201d banter and it is funny as hell. Phil sounds tipsy and is kinda slurring his words and spitting when he talks \u2013 and I am officially looking forward to the second set. They finally resolve whatever issue they had and blast away into another fat, burbling groove which is Samson. Billy and Mick sound perfectly in tune with each other tonight. They pull this one off beautifully and Jerry once again is soloing like a man possessed \u2013 fast and furious and precise as could be. For sounding half in the bag, Phil is playing off his ass tonight \u2013 just dominating. WOW, what a jam out of this one, right into one of the worst transitions I have ever heard \u2013 right into CRS. As terrible as that transition was, the odd placement works for me and so does this version. Jerry sounds calmer and his voice sounds waay better than it did in the first set. Sweet job on that little opening combo\u2026.OK, so next up is the insanely good combo of Playin\u2019>Eyes>Estimated>TOO>Drums>Aiko>Stella>Playin\u2019 reprise. Beginning with Playin\u2019 this heady nugget slides right into a phantasmagorical display of mind bending musicianship. They drop right in, on cue @ about the 3 minute mark and we are officially aloft. Like a picture from above, this one provides an aeronautical view of the compositions wild terrain. Slow motion beefy wah licks keep this one hovering around the target like a gentile storm rolling in on a cool breeze. There is no real sense of when the storm will hit, but you can feel it in the air. Erupting like NY Lake Effect snow, Eyes comes surging outta that little jam and showers the crowd with licks of the utmost precision. Jerry's furious soloing leaves behind a white-hot trail of cosmic debris that coalesces into a moment of low level silence, which transforms into a monumental Estimated. That seismic shift from the rapturous Eyes into this Technicolor Estimated is simply magnificent. Almost the second the crowd settles into the heavy groove of Estimated, Phil starts the adrenaline inducing roll and we are off again in the form of TOO. Jerry takes off again like a maniac in this thunderous fugue and my jaw about hit the freakin\u2019 floor. Are you kiddin me man? Holy shit I am in awe. About the time I got done shakin\u2019 my head in disbelief, Jerry dethrottles this one right down into Drums. Drums then develops into an extremely NFA- esque Iko Iko. I don\u2019t think the crowd had the slightest idea that this song was not a tripped out NFA until at least the 3 minute mark. They really cut the amalgamated funk loose on this drippy oddball, and the result brings a pie-eyed smile to my face. Nice. Just like that we are knee deep in the ballad of the night, Stella. This mournful tearjerker emanates outta that graceful presence one can only describe as, \u201cJerry\u201d. This one is absolutely breathtaking in every way. Silence from the crowd, as the tender phrasing comes outta the Bean. Where his shaky/strainy sound of his voice hurt him earlier in tonight\u2019s performance, I think it now accentuates an already incredible version of this song. I honestly don\u2019t know how Stella gets any better than this. I was incredibly caught up in the moment of this one, and it had my head spinning. Ever so gently this one comes to an almost full quiet, and just like that we go full tilt into Playin\u2019 reprise which proceeds to blow the roof clean fucking off that little gymnasium - and we are done. Holy shit that second set was un-Real. Bobby pops back out and wishes them a Happy Homecoming for the second time this evening and lays down the JBG encore. Well done boys, and the crowd is absolutely howling. My god, what a freaking roller coaster ride that was. \n\nThoughts \u2013 I have come to the conclusion that his show was a raucous, maniacal, drug fueled, five-alarm face melting fire. Regardless of what influence they were under, it sounded like they were having a great time up there. The precision and control they displayed this evening was remarkable, considering half of the time it sounded like Jerry was playing as fast as he could. I really liked this show. Minus the somewhat screwy setlist and Jerry\u2019s shaky sounding vocals at times, this could have been an all timer. That second set was unbelievable and I am definitely recommending this one. This has to be one of the wildest shows I have heard, and I am giving it an A.",
