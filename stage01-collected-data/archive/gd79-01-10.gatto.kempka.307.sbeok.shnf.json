This is a rocking show and one of Donna and Keith's last(2/17/79)2nd to last dark star of '79 and then zip until 12/31/81 and this was a rocking show - I was in 9th grade and my parents would not let me go to this prob for good reason.....\n\nWhole first set is good but loser>music ripping.... Set II is a Winterland caliber show in Uniondale NY and presages the Wynton show 10 years hence. Donna is on and reminds us why she was nice to have around on shakedown, bertha, miracle, dark star is luminescent and Donna's last as she was not on stage when they played this in Buffalo 10 days later.\n\nNot sure if anyone else agree but think it can be argued this represents the last of that legendary '76,'77,'78 era any doubters can consider that they shuttered St Stephen until 4 1/2 years later at the Garden 10/11/83 (352 shows).\n\nOne last thought, when shakedown came out alot of people were conflicted over whether or not is was heretical to like shakedown as this was a 'sellout' disco song... you can hear the muted response from the crowd and this was the height of the 'disco sucks' movement where they steamrolling disco albums - this version goes along way to winning over doubters - just got to poke around rap goes on forever.... \n\nThis deserves a 5 as it is a superior show, great quality, and is a milestone whether they knew it or not.",

I saw this show down on the floor, there were many of those among us that had all partaken and all witnessed the spaceship that came down during the jam and scrambled our psychedelic souls to the core.  I was 17 and this was probably my 20th show and it hooked me for good.  If anyone can recommend a better space jam please advise.  I had a tape of this show shortly after the show and then I lost it in about '82.  I've searched for a long time to hear this again so thank you for the upload.  I'm sure many of you can relate to the flashback goosebumps I felt hearing this show for the first time in 22 years.  The Dark Star has a beautiful crescendo, Bertha's got that awesome rhythm/keys/lead tradeoff going in the second part of the break, and check out the Miracle, with Jerry riffing the whirlybirds and the crowd goin bananas.  Other reviews on this show are right on.  Don't miss this one.  Turn it up, sit back, and get ready to launch.",

      "review_text": "How about this! Although I have never heard this show before, I have always wanted to get it. I based this on two factors: First, this show took place shortly after the closing of Winterland and the band was on a roll. Second, I took a look at the set list and it was tantalizing, particularly the second set. I know it is not always good to judge a show based on a set list, but when the set list is combined with the way I thought the band was playing at that time, I thought I might as well try....Success! This show not only met my expectations, it exceded them. It sounds like it was a high energy show for both the band and the crowd. I know there is lot crowd noise, but I actually like that. Many of the tapes that I had in the past sounded similar to this and it transports you into the audience, as if you are actually there. This is especially enjoyable if were to young to be concerts at that time (like myself). I hope more people (especially ones like me)download this to get a small taste of the experience.",

I was in 9th grade and had been to a few concerts at the Coliseum so I thought I knew what to expect.   This show changed my  life!  It has a country twang through the first set and then then it takes you to new place altogether and ends with my hit and rock and roll.  They needed no pyrotechnics (which were very populart then) and they blew me away.  \n\nEveryone was screaming for a song called Dark Star so I screamed for it too then a guy leans in to me and says \"dude their doin' it\"  I was baked and had no idea when this new song started  but I did know this was the start of my love affair with the Dead that would last over 200+ shows.\n\nI think the quality is great for an audience tape.

Moved behind the lower bowl seats stage left for the second set and got a nice buzz on as the opened Shakedown, then ripped through the I Need a Miracle->Bertha->Good Lovin' trifecta. Listening to the tuning before the next tune, I thought I heard something special about to happen and I nudged the guy next to me and said Dark Star! Of course he said no way, dude, they don't do it anymore. No sooner did those words leave his mouth than out from the stage came the opening notes of Dark Star and the place went nuts. In the end that very nice first set gave way to a crusher of a second set that left me completely spent and very fried.\n\nMy kudos to the taper who managed to make a superior aud (I tend to prefer boards since my hearing has aged) in a building that is notorious for bad acoustics. The show is a definite 5. The recording is worth a 5 or better just for getting a nice sounding recording in that concrete tomb!",

The 12/31/78 Dark Star was the first in 4 years, and is better than many of the Dark Stars from '71-'74. Also one of the last St. Stephens for a few years. St. Stephens was revived in 1976, and here it is one of last in the '76 style.\n\nThe playing throughout the whole show is excellent, and the boys are sharp. Jerry's voice is a little off, something that become more and more common as the years passed. I thought the very first reviewer here had good comments about the end of an era, as one of Keith and Donna's last shows, and last good shows.",

The following night was my first show ever. Not as good as this one but no slouch either.\n\nSound quality, especially for an aud, is 4 stars at least. Show is an easy 5. DL highly recommended.",

Nice recording. I agree, the audience is not a problem but a background energy positive here.  Great versions of Shakedown Street, Miracle, Around & Around, Dark Star, St. Stephen, Row Jimmy, Music Never Stopped.   I remember the Coliseum was shakin a lot that  night- the opening Shakedown BOMB was really, really cool.  It was the only show I saw with Keith and Donna.  I remember really loving watching Donna on stage, great backlighting.  She does a great job singing at this show.  I got on the bus and stayed on ... next gig was Lafayette College in May 79 to begin my first Road Trip (with my brother O) \u2013 covering Lafayette, Binghamton and U. Mass Amherst shows (rather than covering a weeks worth of classes at Oswego State!)  It all worked out\nPeace and gratefulness\u2026..",

This St. Stephen was not a St. Stephen like on Live Dead, but surprisingly I was the only time I seen them play St. Stephen! For that reason along I give this a 5 star. Jerry was really emotional on stage.",

Personally the sound is distant but it is pretty obvious that this was one of those over the top shows.\nI was at the Branford show 10 years later just happened to have a bed sheet that read LAST NASSAU DARK STAR 1/10/79 \nlittle did I know they would be playing it that very evening. \nBut I was so blown away that I didn't remember to break out the bedsheet until after the concert which was funny but anti-climactic. \nI don't pick up Donna until JED.\nTo each their own but give me a pristine board any day. It is cool to hear this but the reason I gravitate towards boards is because if possible I would have been side stage every single show and a good board does that in spades.\nAlso I find it much more intriguing to hear the banter between the band rather than audience chatter.\nOh well better than seeds and stems or smoking banana peels.\n5 for the show\nless for no soundboard.\nopinions are like butt holes, we all got one.",

      "review_text": "I Knew they'd play Dark Star I had an extra ticket to the show and offered it to one of my best pals who turned it down because we were going the next night and he was tired, etc... So I told him how our other buddy heard that this musician guy had gotten past security and knocked on Jerry's door at the Sheraton in NYC and Jerry answered it. The guy said he wanted to show Jerry a song he had written and handed him the chart.  Jerry looked at it and said he'd check it out. Before he closed the door, the guy asked, \"Would you play Dark Star tomorrow night, for an old 'Head?\"  Jerry winked and said, \"We'll see.\" Meaning yes?\n\nWell, I didn't necessarily believe this even though it came from a good source.  And my friend didn't believe it either and said he'd see me the next night (another very good show, as it turned out).\n\nAnyway the boys were in a good mood (I'm guessing some good NYC blow) and had a lot of energy, as did the crowd.  Love that Tennessee Jed. Weir is hilarious (\"everybody polka?\").\n\nAnd that second set?  Maybe not the best performance of all the songs ever, but St. Stephen and Wharf Rat and of course Dark Star in one set?  The place almost came off the foundation.\n\nI see that someone said Jerry gave it a \"C.\"  Not sure where that came from but I saw the Dead about 100 times and JGB a bunch, and Jerry was the last to walk off the stage that night, and he was waving to the crowd with a huge grin on his face.  He usually wasn't into showing much emotion on stage.  That's what I remember most from the show, him walking of, smiling and waving and basking in the applause for a job well done.\n\nSo, it's probably a 4-star show, but for the set list, the energy, and that Jerry smile, I bumped it up to a 5.  Also, having heard a lot of audience tapes, this one is pretty clear and the audience sounds aren't too annoying, so you get a real feel for the show.\n\nTo this day, I tease my old friend for not taking that ticket (it was probably 12 bucks).  In fact, I just sent him a link to this tape!",

I didn't see this January 1979 concert in person, but I listened to this version the other night - and it is STELLAR.  Most of what I wrote below applies here as well.  \"The Music Never Stoped\" / \"Shakedown Street\" / \"Dark Star\" / \"Wharf Rat\" / \"St Stephen\" were super high points (for me) - but everything from \"TMNS\" on (\"Bertha\" & \"Miracle\" especially ) is just superb ... I saw many shows in 1979 - so catching up with this one was really nice!!!",
