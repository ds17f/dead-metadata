By '95 there wasn't much left to see... even the rest of the boys sound REALLY bored and the playing is sloppy.   May Jerry rest in peace.",

Unfortunately it is far from notable musically as the band are all over the place, and not just Jerry.\nThe first set is rather good, and had the show maintained that momentum into set two, this would be a far more enjoyable show to listen to. However, set two is a shambles for the most part, with Victim being the worst example - just listen to it - there is a whole verse where everyone is playing completely different parts and it sounds embarrasingly bad. Phil even stops playing for a moment while they figure out where they are going to pick up from. Dear old Jerry, despite playing pretty well in the first set, goes from bad to worse in the second, and it is just troubling to listen to such an enlightened musician in such a bad state of being. \n\nThis show did more than make me cringe, as most '95 shows do at points, this actually made me depressed.

Yes 95 was mediocre at best and obviously it was the end of the road, but was it significantly worse than some of mid-80's shows? \n\nIs Vince's high pitched screaming and worse than Donna's screeching?   \n\nI enjoyed these shows (my last) and saw as many as I could because it was clear the road was coming to an end.  My tour life was '89-95 so I was relatively late to the game.  As such I tried to make it up in quantity.  Towards the end rarely was everyone on.  That was to be expected so instead you went for the moments when things clicked.  Sometimes you were lucky and sometimes not so much.    \n\nThis run exemplified that - does it compare to 71/72?  Of course not, but that isn't a fair comparison. \n\nThe good news is that there is a body of work that is available which allows us all to reminisce and recall the great times that were had.  Sure it wasn't all great and the scene got worse and worse, but I would take a mediocre/bad Dead show over most any other band on a great night - back then and today.",

Like Jerry, some of us did'nt make it. This was the life we chose and though I feel sad, I know, you know....we rocked it on down. We took it passed the limit. I'm super proud to be a \"DeadHead\". My 1st show was Alpine 1984. My life changed forever. I always felt different and when I saw my first show..I felt like i belonged. As for the show itself, I remember my brother saying, \"you got your Unbroken Chain\". I was happy. If you're a music critic, you probably think this show sucks. I'm not...like i say,\"if you were inside, it was great!\" When spring tour 1989 ended in Minnesota, i remember security screaming over their megaphones...\"Dead Heads go home, tour's over.\" That was funny.",

Grateful doug siad: \"Yes 95 was mediocre at best and obviously it was the end of the road, but was it significantly worse than some of mid-80's shows?\"\n\nYes it was! You saw them from '89-'95. What do you know about the mid 80's? I saw them since '78 and '85 was the best year of all from '78-->'95. Cryptical brakeout (and others) during '85 was insane. St. Stephen in 'fall of '83 was great too. You certainly can't just say the mid 80's were bad, because Jerry showed up more often than not than. By the time you were on the band wagon he was on the downside (not that '89-'92 didn't have it's moments-especially with Hornsby). So don't tell us what we saw was bad when you weren't even there.",

The rhythm section is really holding things down and it's still fun to check out these many years later.\n\nOne thing I've noticed here is that Vince (in the right ear) seems to be detuned by a few cents, which I find annoying.  Or maybe someone else is slightly out of tune.  I think it's Jer actually now that I listen more ...\n\nAside from that, not a terrible show.",

And since this is the only SB, I'm giving it 5 stars.\n\n(As for the completely off topic comments below about Hornsby--they don't belong here. He didn't even play this show, but if he had played, I certainly wouldn't complain about him. Hornsby is about as good pianist as they come.)",

      "review_text": "Hornsby The man has his talents. They most often are on keys or piano but he sure the hell did not belong with the Grateful Dead and the only people who think so were already Hornsby fans to begin with. I mean honestly. Who the hell wants to hear a damn accordian at a Dead show? Vince (God Bless his soul) was a hell of a lot better choice than Hornsby and frankly they both sucked. There was little to nothing the band did that was worth listening to after Brent died. As a matter of fact, I hear people bash on later day Dead shows WHO HAVE NEVER HEARD ONE! It's just because they are wanna be puppets nodding their head to the old guard. The old guard earned their opinion. They went through it all. The others, well, whatever...\n\nHaving said that, people are way too hard on later day shows. Their loss. Not mine. I'm sure if Jerry knew what a bunch of ingrates he was dealing with while he IS UP THERE DYING he would have quit long ago. 90% of you did not deserve him.\n\nBest on piano was Keith. No question. But as the total package, Brent smoked him. Keith could not sing. And in later days when Jerry had come out of his coma, Brent carried the weight. Man had heart, soul and was the longest lasting man in that chair. There are gems in 94/95. Granted they don't fall out of trees like say in Spring 90, 1977, 1974, 1973, 1972 and so on. For what it is worth Led Zeppelin's performances started to take a dive in their career also. This is not unique to the GD at all. Good shows in 95? 2/21/95. If you have a pulse, the Visions of Johana should most certainly get your attention. Great Black Throated, Lazy River Road and more. If you want to compare a show almost 20 years later to a 70s show your just setting yourself up there.",

So I went to Shoreline. I was aware at the time that this show was really bad. Strangely, my first show was coincidentally objectively the best show of the 63 shows I saw with Jerry. That was 10-16-89 however I think the most fun was maybe some Deer Creek ones. It was a burnt scene at Shoreline and they sounded bad.... I got stuck in SF and didn't get back to Chicago for those shows otherwise I would have been at the last one...",

My first show was in '65, and for all those years I loved hearing/watching a band who loved playing, who loved us who were listening and dancing our hearts out, who gave their heart and soul to a whole idea and understanding of all of music and of what it can do to help and heal broken hearts, while it inspires and urges everyone to have a good time while we build a better society than the one we have inherited. Every Dead show gets 5 stars for the love they shared with you.",

Clocking in at nearly an hour, it's among the longer '95 sets. Nice Peggy-O and my highlight is the Lazy River Road and set-closing Cassidy. This second set opener is among the better late-era Here Comes Sunshines.\u00a0The Victim that follows is a mess. As for Unbroken Chain, always thought it was a curious choice to bring back at this late stage in their history - and while I don't think they ever really got it down - this one, like the HCS, is better than most from the era. A forgettable Eyes segues into a good Drumz, post-Space Miracle and Days Between. Definitely drop in for the Days Between. While it's not their finest, it's spell-binding just the same.\u00a0",
