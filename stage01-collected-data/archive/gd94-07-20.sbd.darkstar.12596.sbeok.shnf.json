Great trips, with my best bud, and nothing but trees and cornfields in sight.  The weather was blazin' hot all day and then about two hours before showtime a mad downpour ensued.  \n\nBut the clouds broke and a cooler sun shined again about 30 minutes before the Stranger opener. Peggy-O was gorgeous and a rare BIODTL (with about 20 \"beats\" to kickstart her) got us all shakin' and groovin'. Jer teased Dire Wolf next but then made a wiser choice and went with a different rare selection--High Time.  The first ever Childhood's capped off what for me is still a memorable first set.  \n\nThe second set, as usual, is where it all hit the fan. Three Rivers in '95 gets credot as a supreme rain set because the skies literally opened up on the first note of \"Rain\", but this set is still superior to me. The opening rain tunes were all fitting but the middle-of-the-second-set HC Sunshine, totally out of nowhere, was an all-time highlight.  I still vividly remember freaking when I heard the opening chorus fourth song into the 2nd set.  The Corrina was perhaps the best ever with the jam that followed. Mathilda was icing on the cake and that's putting it mild. By then we all new it was a special night.  Of course out of space you have what was currently (for the 90s) a very rare Space>UJB>Miracle, only to be capped off by an juicy, inspired Morning Dew. A long, joyous, tiring, and spiritual night of music. There's so many other side anecdotes to add but I'm already carrying on. The sound quality's great and perhaps the best playing and song selection they had to offer during this era, even for the Creek. Get it on the Download now and thank me for a real good time!",

I don't think it was that bad a year and I'm a early 70's guy! \nSound is pretty ON and rather warm and enjoyable. Highlights for me are the Peggy-O and Childhoods End along with all of set two. This is where the meat is due the Rain Set. Even Samba IMO is a welcome treat. Wish they would have played Rain as well but what the hey...Here Comes Sunshine is a great treat and the Corrina > Mathilda is jaw dropping and Space > UJB is awesome!! If you were eget this! You know what I'm talkin' about! If not, just stream it for yourself and listen to the crowd go nuts when the break into Morning Dew and then add it to your personal archive!. \nLike I said, I'm more into early 70's Dead but this one will always have a special place in my heart. Truly incredible!\nMan this one brings back great memories....",

Please do not be misled by erronious accounts of bad sound quality- it's very nice and crisp, and Jerry sounds just fine- remember the dude was 53 years old at the time, man!  :)  Jer and the boys rip it up in old school fashion to a wonderful evening of music, rain, and even a non-torn down fence.  Even the Samba was nice (it's raining, it's a samba... it's a Samba in the Rain!).  Grab this one- it's truly worth it.",

The actual performance itself leaves a lot to be desired. Jerry sounds really wiped both vocally and musically. If you were there, grab it, if not, your bandwidth is definetley better spent somewhere else. The 3 star rating is for sound more than performance.\n\nI just read another review that said that DeadBase called this the best show of 94....Even of the shows I saw in 94, which wasn't nearly all of them, I find it VERY difficult to put this show even in the top ten. 94 highlights that blow this outta the water in my opinion are as follows: 3-16-94, 3-21-94, 3-25-94, 3-27-94, 6-13-94, 6-26-94, 10-5-94. Just my opinion though......",

Everyone went nuts.  It felt like sunshine breaking with the first notes.\n\nAnyone here remember Jerry bumping his head against the microphone at the end of Morning Dew? He was jamming so hard during his solo, that when he raised his head to belt out the final \"I guess it doesn't matter....\", he smacked loudly right into the mic!!!  He smiled as he recovered and sang it.\n\nTrue magic that night.  Listened to the whole show again that same night back at Glow Wood.",

The band (specificall Jerr) was resurging for a while - only to fall back into their wild hit or misses in '95. But this show is a good example of strong, rich performances in '94. A good first set with great features - the BIODTL was rockin', and High Time was a nice little treat. Nice theming in the second set with a celebration of rain, followed by a \"rain, rain, go away\" version of HCS. A pretty cool space leading into a rare post-space UJB, a nice 'welcome-home' from that tripped-out terrain. And to those who say Jerry's voice was going and that's why Phil and Vince got so much play, I say \"Peggy-O\". And then I say \"Morning Dew.\" And then I say, \"Ahhhh.\" We may be in the shadow of the eventual downfall here, but it's yet to come, and this show does have it.",

Vince and Phil try to save it, and Jerry tries to compensate with vocal emphasis on the second verse but he's too out of breath to really pull it off, and it ends abruptly. The Dew isn't much better.\n\nThe recording quality is great, though, except  some weird low-end noise during Stranger- sounds like some kind of electronic difficulties onstage.",

After being paralyzed this was my first show back to Deer Creek where the local farmers loved when the circus came to town. Always ranked up at the top in Deadbase as shows and venue. If Im not mistaken, this WAS Deadbase's top show of the summer tour, for what its worth. While they missed some lyrics and fumbled through at times, wasn't this all part of The Dead's mantra as it pertains to life. Hate hearing the so-called \"Heads\" who expect perfection of a live show.\n\n I was let to roll on down to the front row. Jer singing of Peggy-O was my highlight, it became so quiet during his playing it sounded sooo sweet, along with the Morning Dew. HCS out of the rain songs and the UJB out of space, nice. 1st Mathilda \n\nThe opener, Feel Like a Stranger was eerie - how fitting after having missed almost two years while rehabing my way back into a new life. How much stranger could it have been for a guy to be back and have them pull that out to welcome me home! \nOne Ill never forget.",

Having experienced the highs and lows of the spring tour and the resurgence of Summer '94 up to this point, let's see what this offers. \n\n1st Set Highlights: The Stranger with MIDI Phil is very good. MIDI bombs! Lyrics die in High Time, but it still comes together nicely.  Phil debuts a solid Childhood's End. Jerry belts out Don't Ease Me In. \n\n2nd Set HIGHlights: The \"Rain\" set: Box of Rain, Samba in the Rain, Looks Like Rain, Here Comes Sunshine. Corrina>Mathilda is very creative, with a nice transition jam. Space is interesting, opening up with a Bobby solo. UJB>Miracle>Dew, all quite good. \n\nBest of the year? Not really. Maybe at the end of my trip through '94 I'll put together a collection of the best cuts from various '94 shows. I'm not usually a fan of the Road Trips approach, but for 1994, the playing was so inconsistent across most sets, it is needed.  ",
