The Box of Rain was a nice opener, the Foolish Heart is my favorite ever - Jerry's solo is incredible, the LL Rain is solid and fitting, and the Terrapin is beautiful. The Morning Dew, however, is the highpoint for me and it is my all time favorite. Brent's organ playing throughout is magical especially the punctuation he adds during the \"You never seen those people anyway\" line and in the crescendo of the last guitar solo. When Jerry gets to the young man moaning, he is on fire and that fire blazes in the guitar solo that immediately follows. The final solo starts silently and builds up nicely - teh way a MD should - to a powerful end. The Lovelight encore was pretty average, but at that point we didn't care.",

There are a lot of shows with Brent in not-from-this-world form. This is one, as I said before, check out that Terrapin. Sound quality matches up the performance (i.e. near perfect).",

This whole three show run could arguably be held up as the finest example of latter day Dead.  That's probably why GDP decided to release an amalgam of these three shows for the video release \"Downhill From Here.\"  \n\nMaybe it's because I was at these shows, but for me the three of them work as a set...no one of them is complete without ther other two, even though all three stand on their own as excellent performances.  Download all three, they sound terrific, and enjoy!\n\nbtw my memory of the event was that the whole place was a dry dustbowl for two days then the rain came pourin' down heavy and strong on day three (hence the Box/LLR in the 2nd set).  People were so glad for a respite from the heat they were flinging themselves down the muddy hill in the lawn section all throughout the last show.",

      "review_text": "Right on-  Alpine Valley ! I agree previous review in that this 3 night run seems to be seamless.Some of the best Dead in this past decade. It was all there to qualify that statement. Aside from being at all 3 and had seen the Dead alot , they were peaking as a band again in 89 also spring-summer tour 90. The sets were hot/song selection, kick ass outdoor venue and other than rain I remember the 18th a beautiful mid west summer day and some spots first and last day. The rain was bad and I witnessed the mud slide which I'll never get no matter how high. I was chillin in the venue looking behind me and thinking wow are those dudes crazy for sliding in the mud. Woodstock summer of love 89, the sixties all over. I know plenty of slipped by mistake or accident but some were playin in the mud. Any way unbelievable stuff and this definetly ranks high on my personal best times, these are my favorite memories this 3 day pschedelic experience with the Dead and friends, I was 18 and having the summer of my life and the Dead were on a roll, even hotter than the Greek this time around which isn't an easy task. I'am still blown away by this Althea , Jerry's solos are so sweet  with that reverby effect and the same on the Desolation Row solos, He nails em' big time. As mentioned above no need to single out songs, all are awesome and right on the mark. I remember  starting to get off to Sugaree grooving with the crowd and bouncing around. wow, it was truely a beautiful experince. Wish I could do it all over again,starting with my friends gathering at my parents house at the time. The Dead Head tail gate party started there and neighbors in middle suburbia were gaulking at the stickerd up cars and tye-dyes. \n Happy Trails......",

They have it all...and the boys are playing so well together...the energy is electric from the first note of Good Times on 7/17 all the way through the last note of Lovelight on 7/19.

With this run at Alpine, not only were the boys on, Bobby has a looseness to his playing that opens the sound in a way that I have not heard since a decade prior. Maybe it is just the wide open mellow Alpine venue that makes it, in any case this is a run where it all comes together. If you have any questions, just listen to Masterpiece.

Then I just streamed this in and thought man what an f***in' show! I was here? Bet your a** I was! Timing and lyrics mostly right on and Jerry's a wailing on the leads with authority whilst Bobbys lays down fluid rythymn notes under the thunder of Phil. Glancing sympathetic looks from Jerry on the big sceen while we wiggle in  rain trying to stay warm. I attended this  awesome show! Now I know in my wisdom and reinforced here, whatever the state you may be in at a point in time, and things ain't goin' your way, try to make the best of it and ramble on..\n\nThanks for rekindling the memories...Peace",

Part of me... is still there on that last night, dancing in the rain and the lightning with the thunder.  I managed to see Jerry and the boys over 70 times between 85 and when the miracle moved on... but that Morning Dew.  I almost don't even want to hear the recording.  I'm already just about in tears... having just purchased an iPod and finally getting into iTunes and everything it means... I found this site and so many miracles of yesteryear and I am GRATEFUL to the founders of this Web site.  At the same time, I've found sincere sadness that I thought I'd left behind me... because I never thanked Jerry personally.  And I think he needed it.  I am OUTRAGED by all you morons who dare to comment on his relative performance abilities as the years passed on... because he gave and gave till the end... and anyone who can criticize even the last performances... can go to hell without a bucket... because you obviously missed the whole show and were obviously the ones who caused the problems at the shows near the end if you were even there.  I remember you, too... it didn't  matter how many shows you saw, it could have been one show in '94... you either got it or you didn't.  I feel sorry for you that didn't get it, because maybe you never will.  And for those of you who did, and do... for the faithful... let us never forget to thank the ones who give so much for our soul-healing... like Jerry did.  And for the opportunity to experience three days in the middle of nowhere, even in the pouring rain and foot thick mud... because the music was god.  And we... had each other.  Maybe we still do.",

The whole run was a blast. \n\nHowever, before the start of this first set, standing in the cold, sputtering rain, I had my doubts. I was wearing a plastic bag in an attempt to stay dry. An older head approached and told me to take the bag off. He said I already knew I was going to get wet when the music kicked up, and I might as well get with the program right then and there. So I tore the plastic bag off and headed for the first grassy knoll behind the seats to prepare to boogie. The knoll was slippery as hell, so I wiggled my toes into the mud until my feet were anchored in place. The music started up and many folks walking past my perch were fooled into approaching close enough that they lost their footing and slid down the hill on their collective backs. It was sooo funny. \n\nHowever, the second set cuddle-puddle/mud wrestling extravaganza that took place on the grassy lake during the Other One was an expression of ultimate freedom and abandon, imo. The look on the group of locals' faces who watched the cosmic water festivities from the safety fo the sidewalk was worth the price of admission. \n\nlw",

From Beatles 'Do it in the Road' to Jerry trying to sing 'Blackbird' twice in the same night... Alot of Alpine shows during this period that it's almost impossible to select a best because each, as always, provided it's own highlights and aura.... Yet to Me ?, when I hear this rendition of 'Looks Like Rain' it just sense shivers down My spine, and creates a flashback on so many experiences that I can only regret never to have to opportunity of living them out again while appreciating the reality of knowing that I had so many precious moments to have the honor of remebering... It's not about tearing apart every tune technically.. Not a matter of whether Jerry was ON or OFF... Not a matter of whether it was too hot, too cold, or too wet... It was all about a sense of community no other band was ever able to replicate... It was about Meatless hotdogs for a 1$... It was about how I sold hugs for a 1$ only to give the 1$ back because they hugged Me too, and that had the same value as mine... It was about togetherness with the sweetest sounds as the background, and the reason... It was about a Band that allowed us a sense of Freedom that should've reminded us all that it's what this country should be all about... For what we did as a DEAD community wasn't being done anywhere else in this world... And it's about appreciating the Band that enabled for these greatest feelings, and experiences that so many of us cherish the memories of. With those shivers I'll always remember.",

Jerry was in top form, lucid and crisp on guitar and vocals, and also quite animated on stage.  Brent was splashing keys everywhere in some of his best playing I think ever.  Rythm devils were driving it and Phil laid down the huge fat bottom.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the power they displayed on this night.  How about the seamless Mamma Tried> Mexicali> Althea?  The DEAL!  The Foolish Heart of all things! I think all of Alpine took off on a magic carpet ride during foolish heart. I remember the crowd going absolutely f'ing nuts!  There was a fitting Box of Rain, more rain and then a MONSTER, crushing Terrapin! With the exception of the Wheel, which kind of fell off at the end, and a song selection here or there, this was as good as it got in '89.

The first night was dry and clear, thus the SOTM in the second set was especially kind. Out in the lot we were listening to The Who doing Tommy live in NYC via radio. The rain started late on the 17th or early the 18th. Rain was on/off most of the second day but evolved into a nearly constant downpour by the end of the second night. By the 19th everything was mud. \n\nThe first set on of the 19th is an amazingly dark and cautionary selection of music. Think about it, Going to hell in a bucket. Sugaree, with its tales of last requests before death and meeting in the afterlife. Mama Tried, the tale of a man doing life in prison without parole. Mexicali blues, the tale of a man who caught VD from a 14 year old whore and then kills a man at her insistence. Althea, with themes of love & death. Victim, so obviously and vulgarly dark and foreboding that there is little to add but to note the supremecy of this particular version. West LA, the death of John Belushi with an extra long bridge jam. Desolation Row, the name speaks for itself here and Bobby gets all the words right. And finally, Deal, telling us that we always have choices, that we can make good decisions and make the right things happen if we are patient and willing to hold our cards. A last bit of light and the end of a ten-song first set filled with death and destruction, in a mud filled pit, populated by 40,000 very high people.",

Moved from St. Louis, which was a great Dead outpost in the late 60's and early 70's( remember the Fox Theatre) when I took a job in Wisconsin in 1985 and was delighted to find Alpine less than 30 minutes away. These 3 shows were everything everyone has said about 'em, having summed up the run in such wonderful and graphic detail. We were all on the same starship that run of shows. Knew there was rain on the horizon for the last show so I just wore a knee-length tie-dye I got at the Spring '89 Mecca shows in town, put my glasses in my fanny pack and turned my head to the stars and took off. Brought along the woman in my life who I'd taken to one show the year before, her first show, since she grew up as a Junior League kinda suburban mom. The enhancements were strong & clean and we strapped in for the ride. Her mind was blown by the 2nd song, being her guide for the night I buzzed above her high enough to enjoy while still keeping her safe. By the 2nd set she was crusing so I decided to cut loose my anchor to the 3rd dimension and with the Rain songs, Foolish Heart and a stunning Terrapin, by the time Jerry hit Dew, I was charting the same course the Cassini probe was to follow towards Saturn some years later. Jerry's vocals on Dew were cosmic to my mind, the strength & energy produced in those moments had to be felt to be truly appreciated and I achieved that perculiar state of bliss that I feel can only come at a Dead show, heading out among the stars surrounded by all the love and protection provided by the energy of all of us and the music as gifted to us by the boys. These moments make this incarnation so sweet...my thanks to all.",

The show was short because the weather was so awful but whatta show they gave us!  I remember the only time it stopped raining was during Drums and Space.  As the band began teasing The Other One, the clouds over the stage parted and a fat full moon (that we had danced under two nights before to Standing on the Moon)was revealed.  The crowd on the lawn howled!  They played an outstanding Other One and just as it was winding up the clouds closed again on the moon and by the time the Wheel began, it was raining again.  By show's end I had soaked my last set of dry shoes and drove back to Toronto afterwards (no way could our tent survive another night of that!) wearing a pair of ill-fitting moccasins my girlfriend had made me.\n\nI have always been surprised that they chose the first show of this run for the Downhill From Here video.

But like the previous two nights, I think it\u2019s been slightly over-hyped over the years.  I think Cal Expo and Greek after these shows were just as good.  It\u2019s particularly odd when someone says \u201cbest of 89.\u201d  I mean, seriously!  These things are subjective, of course, but I just don\u2019t see how there can be much real debate that this was a better show than 10/9 (or even 10/8).  \n\nThe scene: as everyone has noted, this was the worst night of the three, weather-wise.  Constant rain.  Everyone was waterlogged already from yesterday, and then it just never stopped raining this whole day and night.  Luckily, I don\u2019t remember being too cold during the show.  After this night, only Tanner and I continued on in the bus, with everyone else catching their various rides back east.  We were off to the beautiful adventures of the west coast.\n\nThe music: very well played first set.  Jerry\u2019s backing vocals on Desolation are really nice (always my favorite Dylan cover).  Foolish Heart is really spectacular \u2013 when Jerry leads the band to the stop/start section, and then keeps going to extend the jam and then leads back for a second stop/start \u2013 that section is some real sweetness.  Hard to believe it was only a year before when we were sitting up on that hill hearing that tune for the first time.  For people who know guitar terms, listen to all the hammer-ons and trills that Jerry and Bobby throw back and forth at each other throughout the show, especially nice during Sugaree and Foolish.  Brent on Foolish proves how much he was worth to the band.  LLR is nice, but not outstanding.  Other One and Dew are both very nice as well.",

I ran out of cigarettes ( nasty habit thankfully long since kicked)and walked what seemed like miles to the AV \"resort\" hotel.

Ended up handing out about 17 of the 20 cigarettes-wasn't the only one who ran out! \nAfter the show I lounged in an orange pavilion seat rapping with fellow freaks until told to move on by security. \"Alpine Valley theme this year: 'stay where you are until told you have to move,' one of us said.\nWas it that night it was still pouring after the show? I got covered in mud sprayed up from spinning tires as I tried helping push cars out of the mud. Couldn't find the vehicle I belonged to-my glasses were muddy, fogged and wet! Found several other lost souls hovered around a charcoal grill at the van of some cool Wisconsin veteran campers. We told \"grateful dead stories\" until dawn. In the morning light I walked about with one of my new friends and we found her vehicle. She gave me a pair of dry socks, for which I was very grateful. Walked off with drier feet and found the vehicle I had come in. It had tried to leave (without me!) and got stuck.

I listen to more Dead now than I ever did, even when really into them in the mid to late 80's and going to lots of shows. I live on the East Coast now, and I am fortunate to work all over NH, VT, and ME. I get in my car every day and drive down all these beautiful little country roads, through the mtns and along the coast. I find a new show to listen to every few days for my drives. One of my favorite things in life is driving through some beautiful bit of landscape and listening to Jerry play, it just fits so perfectly.

Bob doesn't sound a mess and gets the lyrics completely right (not always the case on their covers of this particular number), while gauging the tone brilliantly to give real weight to these lyrics. The synchronisation of the whole band is fantastic and of course what really stands out is the importance of Jerry's contributions. Even when he's not soloing, there's no escaping being emotionally carried by the sound of his guitar, although it really builds up nicely to each of the fine solos. And there's something almost haunting about his deliberately timed contributions to the lyrics. I must admit the first time I heard him come in with the penny whistle line, I was reduced to a tear. As I said, the Dead at their best - and few artists, if any, seem quite as deserving of this kind of tribute as the one and only Dlyan! Thank you GD!",

      "review_text": "Famed downhill run <br />The final night of what is considered the best run of '89. Falling in the mid '89 sweet spot (with 6/21, 7/4 and 7/12), these shows were an era peak. I went to Shoreline and damned if I shouldn't have waited and gone to all three of these instead (though the Cal shows from middle of '89 were grate as well: Irvine, Shoreline, Greek, CalExpo). At that time my wife and I thought we had to hit all the \"theme\" or historical shows: NYE, Solstice, etc. but most of the lightning smokers turned out to be the shoulder shows. These 3 shows (at the end of the tour & at a ski area, hence Downhill from Here) were legendary status immediately; especially as tapes had started to spread faster and (finally!) more liberally. These three shows were discussed as must-haves for a couple years - in an era where looking forward was as competitive.\nThere used to be that joke:\nQ: \"What's the hottest show you ever saw?\"\nA: \"The last one!\"\nThe average cat in the lot would say every recent show was grate (because, of course, they were). So when people came back from Alpine and just said, \"duuuuuuude\", I thought \"Uh-huh, sure, I'll wait 'til I hear the tapes\". Of course, they were indeed the best 3-day run of 88/89, overall. And they play well together as a run still.\n\nFirst Set. One thing about this show: check Bobby closely - <i>Mama Tried</i> for example: the chords, tone, and style he achieves, while singing (...and not flubbing). You know how you know that they knew the machine was present? - check the length of pauses between songs in the 1st set. Proof that now you know you knew what you knew back when you thought you knew what they know (you know...). Though <i>Althea</i> is highly stylized (and was throughout '89 - boys had new toys), this is not only one of the best of '89 but a best-of, period. The interminable <i>Desolation Row</i> (which had no room outside of Bobby) was normally a pissbreak for me (miss Drums/Space? Heresy!), but this may be the best of '89. Though '74 and '77 were the years for <i>Deal</i> (nailed on any given night) this one would stand out even in those years, blowing up into a massive 9-minute version!\n\nSecond Set. As the opener, <i>Box of Rain</i> achieves a different importance here, with Phil delivering a rare, tight version. A gloppy song that didn't always gel, <i>Foolish</i> starts out just average but it's the detours that grab attention when Jer takes the damn thing on an excursion @4:55. '76 was the year for <i>LLR</i> yet here's one with the same character and economical aplomb. The 2nd set falls off from there down to a flat and lost <i>Wheel</i> until <i>Dew</i> soars.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>:\u00a0 A-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 4  stars\n\nHighlights:\nEntire 1st Set (at the very least Althea and the massive Deal)\nBox>Foolish>LLR - great sequence\nMorning Dew - soars\n\n17th - Most consistent overall and maybe 89's top show -  4\u00bd stars\n18th - Variable, with a great 1st set streak and the most interesting 2nd set - 3\u00bd stars\n19th - Best 1st set - 4 stars\n'89 Landmarks from this Run:\nChina>Rider - 17th\nFriend - 18th\nScarlet - 18th\nAlthea - 19th\n\nSOURCES: This one (sbd.437) seems best. The hansokolow matrix just isn't as deep and bright as usual - except for Sugaree, which surpasses the SBD. Three tracks from the first set are on <b>Downhill from Here</b>. From the second set, <i>Box of Rain</i> shows up on <b>Fallout from Phil</b> and <i>Foolish</i> is a bonus on <b>Built to Last</b>.\n\n@AlpineHead Excellent review (below).\n@DancingWolf - Because we're clicking on \"Add Review\" not \"Summarize your overall experience\" (though it's cool if YOU want to). \"Write Review for this show\" has a definition, & the rating scale is 1>5; 1-star being the relative stinkers, 4 being above average and 5 rare. The archive provides this as a tool that helps us decide which shows we give our time to, given limited time versus sheer number of shows now available. Some wanna look for the true aces, and appreciate ostensible objectivism. One day there will be no remaining eyewitnesses, but there will be an archive.",

The boyfriend of the woman who was 'raped' had discovered that the truth of the matter was she had turned tricks and he was so disgusted with her act of 'infidelity' that the boyfriend made false accusations of sexual assault toward Carnival workers that we're here in the city with the traveling circus... black Carnival workers. \n    After a few hours the circulating rumors, then accusations, denials, circumstanstial evidence and beatings befell maybe a dozen men or so ( all Carneys). Later, a pickup truck full of men reached the city hall jail cell and the three black men held within, the mob had reached approxmately 10,000 people. The police force couldn't fight off the mob and they broke their way into City Hall and the jail cells and removed the men and forced them all up to 1st Street and 2nd Avenue East and hung them from a light pole. \n    A local print shop sold postcards of the hanging and I shit you not.\n    A VERY ugly day in my city's past.

It was my first Grateful Dead concert and I was 26 years old. At that time my best friend Mike was a helicopter pilot for a company called Ditka- Kirk Aviation based in Valparaiso Indiana. They had been contracted to fly the band from the Americana Resort( formerly the Playboy club) to the amphitheater all three days of the concert. The first day after landing at the resort Jerry Bob and Phil climbed into the back of the helicopter and we took off in awestruck to the Amphitheatre without a hitch. The second day the rain was pretty bad and visibility was limited. Jerry and Phil climbed in the back and Bob came up to my copilot door on the right side of the helicopter opened it up and told me he would like to ride up front. My buddy Mike told him that that was not possible because he needed me to watch out for other helicopters in aircraft in the area. After using every profanity imaginable he slammed the door and Jerry leaned forward and proceeded to tell us and I quote'' fuck him he can ride in the limo''! My buddy Mike lifted off and as we were flying over the highway, we noticed a line of cars that had to be 5 miles long and we both got a chuckle knowing it only took us 5 minutes to go from the resort to the venue and wondered how long it would take Bob to get there in a limousine. Needless to say the whole experience was Unforgettable as we were issued laminated all access passes which allowed me to walk right up to the stage place my arms on the stage and get some unbelievable pictures with my Canon AE-1. I'd love to post a picture of the laminated pass but don't know how. Watching the deadheads doing mudslides was quite a treat especially the girls! I was lucky enough to also accompany my friend Mike when the who played there as well. Meeting Rodger Daltrey and Peter Townsend was pretty cool. Unlike the Dead concert we had good weather and on the second day Rodger asked if he could fly. My friend Mike verified that he was helicopter pilot, so I hopped in the back and got the treat of having Rodger Daltrey fly us from the resort to the Amphitheatre. My buddy Mike wound up quitting and got a job flying tourist in Maui!",

The sound is light years ahead of any '88 recordings. First year for soundboard going straight to DAT?\n\nWhy aren't they available for download?? I'm more than happy to share them.",

So grateful for ALL tapes, not just for remembering the numerous shows I attended, but to experience all of them, the good, the bad/ugly (just parts), and the great!! like this one. A number of my faves are not here, but even Foolish Heart is so very tight and twinkly. Lyrics right, players all relaxed and happy to be playing, I loved listening to this show.",
