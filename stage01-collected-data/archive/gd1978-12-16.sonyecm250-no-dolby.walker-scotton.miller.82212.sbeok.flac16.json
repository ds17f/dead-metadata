Great levels and high end.  Weird that Jerry still sounds far away, but don't hesitate to dl this one.  The whole show is fantastic. \n\"I knew w/o askin' she was into the BLUES!!\"  \n\n   After truly ingesting this show I do belive it is one of the tightest (to abuse a term) displays of symbiotic jamming of which ONLY this band is capable.  The He's Gone through the other one is as organic as they come with a terrific thundering Phil intro for good measure and totally out of the blue like Jack Cassidy carrening to a bus stop where I got on...back in '86...oh lest I reminesce, this show smokes!  The other one meanders with Jerry's quitessential filigree fret work.  Then plunging into a lower register jam and noodling his way throughout the theme.  He is expending harmonies and lets one know how close rock/jazz/blues are.  All interwoven in a splendid tapestry of aural carpeting.  \n    I am so humbled to know a fellow Minnesotan developed this archive.  Hats off to all involved! true heroes raviging the storied past of the greatest American band ever!!",

Everyone knows 78 was a year in which shows had great versions of a few songs, but dragged a little in the second sets. \n\nNot so this one. EVERY SONG I LISTEN TO IS F**KIN' FLAWLESS.\n\nI thought that all He's Gones after 1974 sucked. No way. He's Gone is ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. Drums rocks too, which is extremely rare for it. (SBD drums almost always sound like shit, because there's little or no echo) Other One is very hot at 15 mins, the show closes with a furious Round&Round, a standout version you can compare to 4-12-78 and 2-5-78.\n\nThis show is excellent. And Scarlett>Fire rips hard, just as it usually does in 1978. This show is like all the great things about 1978, with none of the drawbacks.\n\nI consider myself a big '78 fan...how did I miss this one??!?!?!

Oddly enough, except for a '73 gig at Vanderbilt, I'm pretty sure that these were the only two times the Dead ever played Nashville. \n\nA few things I remember: seeing reams of unsold tickets at the ticket window, so it wasn't anywhere close to being a full house (maybe 5,000 out of 8-9,000?), watching Donna Jean sit down on a folding chair on the back of the stage when she wasn't singing, seeing a hippie chick holding up a single rose in the middle of the crowd. And even though I'm pretty sure they were done with the Wall of Sound by then, I remember that the speakers were piled up higher than any other band I'd seen up 'til then.\n\nMusic-wise, I'd say it's a solid late-'70s show: Bobby must've been learning how to play slide or something because there's a lot of that going on. \n\nThe highlight for me, then as now, is the long, spooky moaning and wailing that Jerry, Bobby, and Donna Jean get into at the really drawn-out ending of \"He's Gone.\" I remember thinking at the time: \"Wow, that's some cool shit!\" \n\nIt's still pretty damn cool almost 30 years later.",

But this recording has Jerry front and center--each note is right in your face. I love it. You really get a chance to reflect on his approaches to all these great songs. Bobby does some interesting slide work--better and more subtle than the standard Minglewood/Rooster/CC stuff he palyed slide on in later years. I really like it in Sugaree.

Granted Samson was a dime a dozen back  in these days, but this one smokes. From the Heart of Me is really good too. He's Gone is great with an epic vocal ending and rauchy  jam afterwards.\nThe drums are amazing, it is that Apocolypse Now theme that really was a  career high light for Mickey, and is very enjoyable to listen to.\nThe O1 is amazing and long with this reading really being a stellar example of a modern version.

The band really seems to be out-doing even their 1978 best with this recording. I especially liked the Looks Like Rain -> Supplication and the Drums/Space suddenly breaking into The Other One with the band's full force and power. \"From the Heart of Me\" shows Donna Jean actually participating as a full partner in the music rather than (as another reviewer put it) mere \"caterwalling\". Charlie and crew, many thanks for this absolute gem, and thanks to the Internet Archive for hosting it so we all can partake. This is the Grateful Dead as I first met them in 1977-79, and oh! the memories it brings back!\n\nThe BBC's _Robin Hood_ series put it best: \"NOTHING IS EVER FORGOTTEN\". The Grateful Dead will live forever in the memories of Dead heads, with a little help from technologies like those used by the Internet Archive. And this particular concert definitely is one which deserves to be remembered!!\n\nP.S.

With that being said I have never heard anything like this. Granted 1978 is a little thin in my collection, but Jerry is playing like a mad man possessed. The tone, the fury, the ferociousness and the mechanical ability surpasses most anything I have ever heard him do. In ways it equals the 2-27-69 second set  as far as his playing.(not in lengthy improvisational achievement but in technical ability and passion) While Dark Star & The Eleven from 2-27-69 stands as one of the all time great Jerry moments and the songs here are standard it does not matter. The whole show has Jerry ripping so hard, fast and full of passion what I thought was impossible has occurred: I have even more admiration for my favorite all time musician. (Beethoven second) I give this recording a 2 because Phil's bass is very low, without the full representation of Phil the tape losses admiration. With that being said I have the mind set that this is all about Jerry and indeed Jerry was an absolutely incredible musician, understatement too say the least.",

I was 2 years old when Jerry died, so i'm making up for a lot of lost time(so to speak). My main method of hearing shows is this site, which truly has been a gift, nurturing my love of the Dead.\n\nWith that being said, I've been delving into the archive shows for awhile and have almost NEVER come across an AUD this beautiful, clear and perfect. This truly is a GIFT. When the first few seconds of Candyman came on I couldn't believe my ears. Precise, loud, clear and direct to your eardrums. This show is an absolute godsend to people like me, who never truly got to experience a real dead show (we can all agree that furthur is good but can't compare to a show like this). Thank you Charlie miller and everyone else who makes this site possible.\n\nI couldn't ask anything more from the show itself. every hard-hitting roots Dead song that you would want to hear is on this show. The Lazy lightning > Supplication is a especially hot with some very inspired Jerry leads. Nothing else can be said that hasn't about the Scarlett>Fire, simply one of the best they ever did. One of the very few drums sections that I don't skip over is on this show, followed by  an Other One that takes you to other planets. The real Gem on this show, IMO, is the Candyman. The tears are definitely gonna fall for this one, I know mine did. Jerry's leads are so pure, so realistic, so lifelike that it feels like the man himself is in the flesh, sitting next to you and playing you this heartfelt song. Simply Beautiful\n\nEnough can't be said about my Gratefulness for the Archive. You guys give a kid like me who was in diapers when Jerry died a chance to experience what it was like. And, boy, was it magical.\n\n\n\nPeace to everyone- DeadheadNate",

I wanted to also critically assess the \"decline\" of Keith throughout 78.

They sound more intimate than 1977 (I guess the standard dropped a little in 78 but it's still 5 stars). \nI wonder what the Nashville Municipal Auditorium is like. Is it big? Cosy? A home for Country music? Perhaps it no longer exists... \nImagining the setting is a fun part of listening to these golden nuggets.\nAnd considering it was one of Keith and Donna's last shows, just makes it extra special. \nMANY THANKS!",

He's a bit rusty, but definately drawing on his pedal steel knowledge and channeling what he can of Clarence White (without a b-bender).  Generally love Charlie's touch.  Would have rated it higher but the audience/board mix, if that's what this is, is a bit like being in two universes at the same time.",

I just got done \u2714 listening to THIS MASTERPIECE ...\nand It honestly, BLEW ME AWAY !!!! \n\nAfter 4+ decades of listening to the Dead, sometimes I AM STILL, ~ JUST AS AMAZED, by a show like this one, AS I WAS SEEING SEEING THEM for the FIRST TIME !!! (Initially, I was thinking that this \"Scarlet >Fire>\"  is A LOT BETTER THAN BARTON HALL, (5/8/77)...\nHowever,...\n(now,...- I'm @ a few days after I wrote the ABOVE \"Review\" ~ to be sure...,)~ And \nI streamed  \"Barton Hall\" ~ (5-8-77), once again after posting this, (above review). It IS, in fact, a truly great version of this pairing of songs. But certainly,  there's nothing \"wrong\" with this one... It's smokin' too. \"Searchin' for the [BEST] Sound\" of the Grateful Dead!!! ~ can ONLY BE subjective, and usually based upon VERY subjective issues such as whether or not \"you\" we're there, liked the \"set~lists\", and which venue were they at!!! I get a little tired of all the \"kids\" comparisons between songs and shows! \nAnd HEY YOU ... \"Lovelovejerry69\" - (?) ... Respectively, the GD are a \"Jam-Band\", to be sure!  And it's been PART of the \"whole\" in which dancing became an OPTION ~ not a requisite! It's become PART of the reason why \"there's nothing like a GRATEFUL DEAD concert.\" Just as it's  simply ENOUGH TO GET IN, without ANY concern about the \"Seat Number\" on the ticket stub, (unless you're in the first 25-30th rows, !!! lololol.....)!!! DANCIN ' IS OPTIONAL...... !!!!! (But encouraged...!!!) It's simply common sense that if you're dancing interferes the another's \"trip\", ya' either gotta move to a better space, or \"sit down and shut the \"fuck\" up\".... !!!! I REALLY DOUBT that ANY of the band members expected you to be THE voice of Dead Head etiquette; i.e.  To Dance, or NOT at shows!!!!!  Huh!!!~\nPEACEFULLY ~\nG-3rd, 2019........",

It shows in there that Jerry picked up the TB 1000-A Travis Bean for 3 shows, 12/13/78 in Tampa, FL, 12/15/78 in Birmingham, AL, and 12/16/78 in Nashville, TN. I was at the show the next night, 12/17/78, at The Fox in Atlanta, and there was a buzz about it in the crowd. At 16 years old I was at my 3rd show, and was happy with Wolf!!! Maybe someone can verify the TB 1000-A being played at those 3 shows? my memory is a bit fuzzy!!   5 STARS for that fact alone!",
