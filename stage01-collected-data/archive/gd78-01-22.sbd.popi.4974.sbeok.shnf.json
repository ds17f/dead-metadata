The St. Stephen on my tape was cut horribly right before the climax of the jam, but still I would listen to it just because what was there was so hot.  All I've listened to was disc three, but it blows my tape away.  No cut and nice sound quality.  The highlights for me are the other one, which segues into a Jerry solo that develops into the alien theme from close encounters of the third kind.  The St. Stephen is super fat as well.  Kind of a ragged sound with a smoking jam at the end.  Worth the download for disc three alone.  US blues ends very abrubtly, the song finishes, but a half second less and you'd call it cut.",

Thundering energy all the way. Almost out of control. Another parabolic refrain. Jerry is just warming up...\n\nWhat happens in TMNS is nothing short of divine rapture. Jerry's wiggling leads pick the locks of Heaven and throw the gates wide. Then the Dead roll right in- in proud style- jamming all the way and rocking the celestial halls of Ever After, leaving no pillar unshaken. No other band can ride such a pure wave on the muse's tide for as long or as unadulterated as the Dead. Jerry's fingers dance around with their own freedom and cascades of notes will bathe your soul in sense and color as the music plays the band. I found myself laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. Absolute mind blowing a cosmic dandelion into a sparkling sentiment of LOVE.\n\nFor those of you just downloading the second set, please reconsider.",

Appropriately, a stray wind blew the flame of a Bic I was using to light a bowl of hash, temporarily causing the eyelashes of my fight eye to fuse together. So I got to trip on acid and hash and constantly try pry my eyelashes apart while witnessing one of the epic Dead shows of my life. The atmosphere in the venerable old place was indeed ELECTRIC that night. I remember these huge, ancient chandeliers swaying in tome to Phil's thunderous bass, although when I saw that there was no way those old lights were really swaying it just seemed that way. Terrapin was still new and very trippy that night; Samson & Delilah just lit the place up.  The drums/space remain mind-boggling; just very hot playing with that golld old Kesey vibe whenever the Dead visited Eugene in those days. 2 hilarious things happened that nite I have to share: I was standing in the lobby during intermission in a circle passing around a joint; i keep trying to pass it to the guy on my left, not looking at him, just trying to get him to take this joint. Finally i look over and realize he's not taking it because he's a City of Eugene police officer. Then, later, during Jerrry's solo, this big cowboy sitting behind us gets up and announces disgustedly, to no one in particular, \"Who does this guy [Garcia] think he is, Jimi Hendrix or somehing?\"  and walks out. Well, this is (and was) rural Oregon and I guess the guy just wandered into the wrong concert.\n\nAnyway, a great show, VERY downloadable, sounds not perfect but it doesn't matter.  Peace, Jeff",

I've never cared for the Drums segments that pretty much began in '77, but the Other One here is inventive, as is the solo Jerry. St. Stephan and NFA are in a great '76-style groove. Unfortunately, the end of NFA is cut off and Around and Around is missing in this recording. The US Blues encore is here but falls flat.\n\nOverall, a 4.5, with the node towards the 5.",

I haven't heard anything else from this tour, but if the others are anything like this ....  I have heard later 78 shows, and they pale in comparison.  The Other One is 14 minutes of intense playing with a fine space section in the middle, but the real transcendence happens later.  Someone already pointed out the low notes in Jerry's solo.  I don't believe I've heard anything like that in any other show.  Then he blasts into a St. Stephen that builds and builds until it reaches apotheotic proportions.  Holy shit indeed!

This is the only St Stephen I know that does not start with the slow intro, it just goes straight into the great St Stephen lick. phil is very strong and creative throughout this show, but in the NFA he does a unique descendin lick that he repeats throughout the song that I just love.",

Good God - I had no idea what I was in for. Every superlative is right on. The show started a little slow with Jerry's voice really hoarse from the cold he'd had (I don't believe he even sang the previous few shows), but he seemed intent on making up for it with his playing. Even the perfunctory solos in songs like Dire Wolf had something extra going on that night. By the time they tore the roof off the place during the jam on 10SC, you knew something was going on. Bobby and Jerry were jumping up and down during the Jerry-fan section at the end of Jack Straw - I never saw the big guy that animated again after that through my last show at RFK in '95. Nothing else to say about the epic second set except they were indeed a band beyond description.\n\nAlso some VERY STRANGE goings on in my portion of the hall that night. I was down from Olympia with a couple of friends and we joined up with a ragtag bunch of mutual acquaintences that got up to about 10-12 people for most of the night. Out of this group, two crazy coincidences/magical occurances during the set break. First, one of my buddies was sure he knew one of the women and she was sure she recognized him, but they couldn't figure out from where. After much gnashing of teeth trying to figure it out, turns out that his twin brother and her twin sister were a couple during a ski-bum winter in Utah a couple of years previous. He'd met her sister and visa versa but they'd never met each other. YOW!  Just when that one was sinking in, another friend of mine wandered up to say hello. While we were talking, she overheard another woman in this group say her name. She asked her to repeat it, asked where she was from, etc. Turned out they were first cousins who'd never met before. Lots of aunts and uncles in that family and they'd just never connected. WHOA! Major grins and hugs all around at that point. SOMETHING was going on.\n\nWith that amount of magic as a backdrop, then the boyz came out for the second set and proved that there was more going on than you could ever hope to explain that night. Close Encounters indeed!\n\n-Ray (older now, but no damn wiser)",

Eventhough I like them, the '76-'77 St. Stephens sound like the whole band has taken a bucket of qualudes. This one at least has some real energy to it.

Many reviewers consider 12-29-77 a legendary performance in any era, including 77. Question? Do you really think the 20+ days after such a performance they just were so different?

Got my ticket and even my place in line just as the doors opened.  I worked my way to the 3rd row, 3rd seat from center.  \nSecurity came over to me and told me straight up that it wasn't my seat cuz it belonged to his girlfriend.  AND SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT so he told me to enjoy the show!!  \nthis girlfriend was a gorgeous red head.  She wanted to hear Jack Straw so I yelled out to Bobby and he turned around to the band and they went into Jack Straw.  Very Cool.  \nAs they took a breather after Samson and Micky pointed at me and say to those around him \"This guy is going to go nuts\"   I Did!!\nIn case it hasn't been noticed, when Jerry is doodling (Close Encounters jam) no one is playing with him.  In all my shows, it was the only time where I saw the rest of the band find a seat and let their jaws drop to the floor with the rest of us.  As Jerry started St Stephen, Phil gave him a menacing look as Jerry start St S without him.  The drummers hopped on their stools and Keith jumped in as well.  \nThat St Stephen was amazing especial the instrumental before the last couple of lines and cooking into NFA.   \nNot enough time to tell all the other stories but my buddies in the balcony were jealous as the first couple of row were all coked out and I was the first dancing by the stage.  It also helped that Ken Kesey was in the audience and there was a Jester roaming the front few rows dosing people.  What a show!!!",

I wasn't at the show, but I have been at McArthur Court, the old basketball court at UO. It's not in use as a basketball court anymore, but it was when I moved outta Eugene in 2005. It was the oldest college basketball court in the country, and it reminded me of a miniature Boston Garden, as they were probably built around the same time. Mac court is basically built like a square, a box, but it's kinda tall. I remember going to some games, and the place was notorious for being a loud, raucous venue. I think maybe the strange acoustics of Mac court might have something to do with what some folks are getting at with. Garcias 'different ' tone. just a thought I had to add. This is a great show, wish. I coulda been there, but you know what? Thank your lucky stars that you're a GD fan! because what other band played 200 shows a year, and professionally recorded them all? No one. Thank you for putting me on earth to share space in a room with JG even if it was just one time. Looking forward to seeing Phil in NY next week!! \nBe well everyone.",

Indications of things to come start with Tennessee Jed, when Jerry kicks the intensity up several notches for a possible best-ever version.  A scorching Jack Straw follows, and you know there ain't a place you can hide that will keep you from the awesome power of this performance.  The first set ends on The Music Never Stopped, which is every bit as powerful as you'd expect by that point (and is one of the first renditions to include an extended waltz-time middle section).\n\nBut of course, it's the post-Drums part of this show that make it so special.  The Other One is more like a throwback to 73 than a typical 77, already long and and exploratory before the band sits back and lets Jerry do his thing.  He blasts his way into St. Stephen without the usual intro, but never mind -- this is the apotheosis of St. Stephen, a performance after which the listener is never again the same person as s/he was before.  As if more was needed, a nice long, jammed-out Not Fade Away follows, and even Around and Around just adds to the energy.  I can imagine that not too many folks got to sleep for quite a while after this show.",

Ummm they weren't in the band in 1969. Second, lets talk about the sound of the guitars. Phil's bass is much more thunderous sounding in 1978 than he ever was able to attain in the sixties. Bob, well he just learned how to play way better than he could back then. And then there's Jerry. in 1969, Jerry played a Gibson, which has a distinctly different sound from the heavily modified custom Doug Irwin guitar known as Wolf. Lastly... in '69 St. Stephen was routinely paired with the Eleven, which is not at all like Not Fade Away, which... never mind. hopefully you get my point. Peace.",

Based upon my comparison of the end of December '77 shows at Winterland with the other California shows in January '78 -- all of which I attended -- I believe the affliction hampered some of his overall performances. \n\nBut I guess he finally got over the laryngitis because his voice is in rare form and his guitar playing is exemplary. He exhibits so many different tones from out of his Wolf Guitar that it is a veritable palette of vibrant colors. There are so many examples of this on nearly every song that they are too numerous to expound upon. I'll just say I reveled in the Jack Straw the most.\n\nThis show is a pearl of great price.
