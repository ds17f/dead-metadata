The Dark Star is one of the more spacey and dissonant Stars of E72, and one of the best of this famed tour (right up there with 4/24, 5/11 and 4/14). The jam out of Uncle John's Band into Wharf Rat is really interesting--the harmonic territory of this transition is a must-hear. The Sugar Mag is excellent as usual. \n\nAs far as the sound quality goes, this SBD is no HYH or Rockin' the Rhein--it is slightly degraded, but it is very good. If you're a stickler for Europe '72 shows and you don't have this, stop, drop and download.",

Starting with a great segue in from wharf rat, we get a long trippy, spacy jam before the DS verse at 15 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of lovely dead jazz jamming - it starts slow and funky with the drums and Phil, before Keith's piano introduces Jerry. And we're not finished ... a long, dissonant, free-form jerry-wild Tiger climaxes into a short transitional jam into sugar magnolia. Phew",

The Europe '72 release that finally made me like the Grateful Dead could have easily included this set had they not been so constricted by album length and track selection. As it was I'm sure they had to convince the WB folks three albums would sell, let alone five! (It was three, right? Dang, it's been so long since I spun vinyl.) \nAnyway, the music is majestic. All the tracks are gorgeous versions, ones that could be included in anyone's top five and it would be hard to argue against them being there. The mix and sound is very, very good. Down this puppy and play it LOUD.\nFive Grateful Skulls. \nOne more satisfied Deadhead.",
