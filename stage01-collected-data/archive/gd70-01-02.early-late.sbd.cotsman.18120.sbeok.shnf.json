BUT - once they come out of the trance....it is probably one of the HOTTEST jams i have ever heard the dead play PERIOD.  just immaculate.  And THEN the song goes into St. Stephen.  THE funkiest St. Stephen ever.  Just a great funky sound.  The Eleven throws you into another universe.  Show quality is not bad at all...and worth downloading for the third disk alone.",

This one is no exception with hot versions of Masons, Casey, Hard to Handle, and Uncle Johns. The Other One is out there and really goes places, and High Time is very well executed. Probably my favorite version they did. The real gem of these shows is the Dark Star. Its way ahead of its time and gets very pretty and spacy (not in the way were all used to)before heading into some very tight playing. It may not be one to introduce people to the Dead and it may not be one you want to pull out when ever you want a fix of the Star, its more of those special occasion ones when your in the mood for something different...something out there. Eleven is hot too with lots of energy in this one. Flaws and all, this may be the show to throw in after New Years to wake you up and start it up all over again! Good start to the 70's!",

They were truly coming into their own and adding more music and style that no other band has matched yet. Stream this show and you will be looking for a way to copy this on disc. Very good, very mesmerizing. I think 1970 gets a little lost in the shuffle, sandwiched right between '69 and '72 makes it hard to get noticed. It does have it's special moments and deserves a worthy searching through. Start here and you will be glued to your seat for two hours. This show is amazing.",

This is a 4.5 star show only because some of the new songs (Cumberland Blues especially) are a tad flubulous.  The beginning Zarathustra and initial bits of Masons' Children are from an aud source and the vocals all come out of the right channel (I nitpick, I know). But the good stuff is so good it more than makes up for a few minor mistakes or mix weirdness. The Hard To Handle is dynamite as is the long Love Light, Pig's on for this show. But hot damn, check out the incredible Dark Star, one of those cool 1970 versions where they bring it way down to silence and then build back up again, wow.  Mix that with a killer Cryptical and a fine Masons' Children opener and you've got close to pure gold right here. I always loved the Dark Star> St. Stephen> The Eleven transition and I very much like Bob Weirs Monkey And Engineer sung to fill up some time due to technical difficulties. Like I said 4.5 stars warts and all, but it makes no sense to round down so I'm rounding up to 5.",

      "review_text": "Devo's Picks #1 These two shows at the Fillmore East are not only fantastic shows, they represent the direction the band adopted throughout the early 70's with their folk-electric style.  Aside from that, these shows truly establish the Working Man's Dead material which had been floating in throughout 69, as well as a resurgence of Motown and Blues which had taken a bit(bit) of a backseat during the late 60s.  On top of which these shows mark, in my mind at least, the relationship which developed between the Dead and New York, whether at the Fillmore East or Capitol Theater in Port Chester. Whereas the 60's are dominated by San Francisco and the California area, New York is really where the Dead shined during 1970.\n\nFollow the tour: 1970\ngratefuldeadlive.blogspot.com",

Just don't be misled by the people who are commenting on the performance rather than the recording.",

      "review_text": "simply wonderful The Dark Star > Stephen > Eleven > Lovelight is an all-timer. Never mind that the end of Dark Star and the transition into SS is cut ... you know what it sounds like. Everything else is just so good around it, it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe Dark Star easily rivals 2/13/70 (yeah, I said it), exploring lots of exciting terrain including a wonderful Tighten Up jam about 22 minute in. The explosion in St. Stephen is supplied by a drummer, I think, and you can hear Garcia and others on stage being blown away by it. At the transition out of the \"high green chilly\" part of Stephen into the Eleven, Garcia does a little vocalization that suggests to me he is ready to roll, and roll he does. There's a lot to love about this Eleven. To my ears, it's the hottest, tightest version, well elaborated (more than, say, '68 versions) but focused (more than, say, Februaury '69 versions)and powerful. The drummers and band get the little interlude of of the 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4-5BAM! drums runs almost Just Exactly Perfect, one of the only times they really nailed it. It's the combination of all those things that make me prefer it to the other great versions, including the 1/26/69 take on Live Dead. Finally, it's a great Lovelight. I love hearing the band members yell the song out to each other just before Phil drops his big fat bass line (beautifully full on this recording) and sets the stage for Pigpen.\n\nI don't much from the rest of the show, because for over ten years I just keep returning to the Dark Star >> part. Outstanding.",

      "review_text": "Constanten Cosmic Craft <br />After the only East Coast NYE [Boston], they stayed east for two immediate nights in Manhattan. As others have noted, this period is so transitional that they sound different week to week, already a little modified from Boston (granted NYC always brought out endemic shows). The Fill E turned the house at the time, with two shows this night. The early show (@8pm) is noted for a superb Cosmic Charlie, and the late show for a classic '70 Dark Star (the early show has better era material overall). There is an AUD (patching the Mason's) but it's incomplete. This is the peak era for hearing Constanten, who mostly mans the keys, instead of Pigpen. Hendrix taped Band of Gypsies here the night before. Imagine if just a matter of hours had caused a blend! \n\nEarly Show. They take the stage to a house recording of Also Sprach Zarathustra: pt. 1 The Sunrise \u2013 probably before it became clich\u00e9 (long before it became ironic). It's not a truly notable <i>Mason's Children</i>, nor is it at all bad. Neither of the OFF releases have the beginning patched. <i>Casey Jones</i> is a great straightforward reading; crisp, with creative drums. <i>Black Peter </i> is an early version, with one vocalist. It loses tempo and wobbles off key in places. However this is a smashing <i>Mama Tried</i> with the Constanten sound and some extra Jer punch. Though not a huge '71, <i>Hard to Handle</i> is slick and relatively compact; a classic Pigpen/Constanten outing from that short era of the band. <i>Cumberland</i> starts hot but unfortunately trainwrecks after 3mins when they lose the thread. Tom C is again the disparate element in <i>The Other One</i> suite. Not one of the year's most interesting TOOs, but GOGD and w/good drums. There's a tape flip @48secs in TOO on all sources [@6:47 on the OFF]. After a wonderful tranny in, this is a classic <i>Cosmic Charlie</i>, capping the show with glee. The last bit is missing [the OFF patches the last 15secs with 1/3/70 late]. \n\nLate Show. They came out again to Also Sprach: Sunrise, launching a still-new <i>Uncle John's Band</i>. It's a bit unsure until the \u00be mark [on the OFF, the first 9 secs are 1/3/70b]. <i>High Time</i> is a superb, dynamic version w/tumbling drums &amp; Tom C organ. And check that Fender amp tremolo. <i>Easy Wind</i> is still developing and has clunky tempos, but they play hard on it [beginning is missing; first 19secs on OFF are 12/12/69a]. The end is missing on <i>China Cat</i> [@3:09 the OFF cuts to 1/3/70b, omitting the 2nd solo]. Like much of the show, it and <i>Rider</i> have slow speed wavers on all sources [OFF is 1/3/70b for the first 2mins16secs (cutting sun will shine &amp; northbound train verses) as well as for the end tuning and beginning of Good Lovin']. The next couple are standard '70, but while fixing a broken string and the drum riser before Dark Star, we get a slick <i>Monkey &amp; the Engineer</i>. They're not set up for it so the recording qual isn't great, but this impromptu throwaway demonstrates how they can be great when you aren't looking for it. The <i>Dark Star</i> is well-noted and is one of those that plays itself, using the Dead as a conduit. Even through some quiet stretches there's always something coming over the horizon. It goes through a sequence of jams, mostly instigated by Bobby, who starts running through themes @19:50. After 20mins Bobby starts a Feelin' Groovy, but Jer plays around it rather than with it, and Bobby quickly adapts by adding a G chord to the sequence. After 21mins there's some push and pull, and @21:43 Jer tests a D&gt;A theme that becomes D&gt;A&gt;E&gt;D. At 23mins Jer edges back to main theme notes, but @23:41 Bobby instead starts a [long] Tighten Up and Jer jumps on it. At 28mins40secs Jer thinks about moving directly to the main theme and this time Bobby is already there. Too bad tape ran out as they go to the last verse [the OFF switches to 2/14/70a @30:47]. We are also missing much of <i>St. Stephen</i> but otherwise we get a typical '70 plus Mickey's cannon [the first 2 :34 on the OFF is from 2/14/70a with the tempo digitally sped, unnecessarily, condensing from a 2 :50 segment and missing 36secs of the SBD]. The rest is average '70 and here all sources have nearly continuous speed wavers.\n\n<u>Early Show</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>Late Show</u>: \u00a0\u00a0C+\nTogether = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nCasey Jones \u2013 a plinth CJ\nMama Tried \u2013 great Constanten-organ version\nHard to Handle \u2013 compact, Pigpen/Constanten era\nCosmic Charlie \u2013 all-time classic\nHigh Time \u2013 tumbling drums &amp; Tom C\nMonkey &amp; the Engineer \u2013 impromptu bonus wins\nDark Star \u2013 lots to unpack in a hot '70 example, even w/missing end\n\nSOURCES: The partial-early_sbd_86 is the Dark Star&gt;Stephen from the late show. The 137375_sbd_wise is thinner sounding and unpatched. The hanno_12624 is a good source for the early show (it's labeled \"late\"), but the cotsman_18120 is as good and is the best source for the late show. It has fuller freqs and separation and sounds clearer than the OFF in places. Bal/Vol intervention is needed and there are speed wavers, <u>needing pitch corrections</u><b>:</b> Cosmic Charlie needs +1% 2:11&gt;5:16 ; China Cat needs -2% 0:00&gt;0:15, -1% 0:15&gt;1:53, -2% 1:53&gt;2:20 &amp; -1% 2:20&gt;through Rider ; Dark Star has many wavers, one is @25:23&gt;26:21, needing +1% ; The Eleven needs -1% ~8:00 &amp; -2% ~11:00 ; Love Light needs -1% until 8:00, and wavers toward too fast ~12:00. Mason's Children is on <b>Fallout</b> (slightly better mix on <b>Dave's</b>), and has the channels switched on both the SBD &amp; OFF. <b>Dave's 30</b> has most of both shows, with nine songs edited or patched from other shows, and with many speed wavers. The tenable <u>pitch corrections</u> are<b>:</b> Cosmic Charlie's last 20secs need +1% ; first 9secs of UJB need +1% ; first 12secs of China Cat need -1% ; Rider wavers, mostly needing +1% plus +1.5% from 2 :16 ; Dark Star needs +1% 0:00&gt;18:00 &amp; 25:23&gt;26:21 ; The Eleven needs  +1% 0:51&gt;2:00, +2% 2:00&gt;2:14, +1% 2:14&gt;7:29, 8:00&gt;8:40 &amp; 9:57&gt;end ; Love Light needs +1% @0:00&gt;0:07, 0:40&gt;1:14, 12:40&gt;14:37 &amp; 16:20&gt;17:40. On the late show, both SBD &amp; OFF have the channels switched for UJB and High Time. The OFF also has channels switched for Easy Wind through Good Lovin'. The SBD also has channels switched on Easy Wind, China Cat &amp; Good Lovin'.",

I sort of agree with most of the reviewers, to a degree, and although this is still considered early dead it is beginning to start the long strange trip to a different style of dead.  The Dark Star sounds good for the first 15 to 20 minutes then it starts in with some kind of samba beat - what the hell does that have to do with Dark Star - a samba beat - ?  \n\nIs Jerry doing the samba in space - with Bobby - and Pig, et al - ?\n\nSorry, guys, but that just doesn't appeal to me for some strange reason.  \n\nStephen and The Eleven also take a strange turn - but not as strange as the last half of Dark Star. \n\nThe Other One is cool!  Easy Wind - although not as strong as some of the other versions. \n\nI like Bobby's take on Monkey and the Engineer on this recording.  \n\nPig on Lovelight is strong.

      "review_text": "great show after Hendrix and before 2-11 & 2/13 Just in case it's not clear from other reviews, the Zarathustra theme was a Fillmore East thing, not a Grateful Dead thing -- probably the Joshua Light Show, and frequently played with the movie clip of the killing of King Kong -- \"twas Beauty killed the Beast\" -- as the visual.  That probably explains the audience cheers, too: they/we tended to cheer when Kong knocked another one of the planes from the sky around the Empire State Building (a fitting NYC image).\n\nI stayed in the East Village from the Band of Gypsy's concert New Year's Eve until this show, and the Dead lived up to the Hendrix legacy, if there was any question about that.  The Dark Star is as exploratory as it gets, and although I don't  think it is as good as 2/13 it definitely laid the foundation for it: on 2/13 they were \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" -- themselves.  \n\nThe Dead always had to coax the New York audience into following the muse/music and they did it here flawlessly.  \n\nI came back for 1/3 because this was such a great, mind-bending show (their improvisations in Dark Star, which incorporated an endless variety of unexpected riffs, samba included, gave proof to the idea that they were actually exploring -- WITH the audience -- and not just going through the motions.  To me this was the hallmark of the Dead from that era.) \n\nA great show, and a great moment in the band's history.\n\nThis would be a five-star for any other band, but only the Dead could go so far beyond it that it has to be given four stars in order to allow the other, amazing concerts to be differentiated.",

That stretch moves this show into my top 5 all-time.  \n\nOn Lovelight it's amazing to hear the crowd clapping along and singing back the \"shine on me. . . \" from 16 mins to the end. At 16:54 Pigpen demands Bobby to \"repeat after me Bobby \" and you can hear Jerry in the background getting a chuckle out of that.  Pig, Bobby, and the crowd have a little soft back and forth for a little.  Then at 17:40 Jerry takes over for Bobby for a few turns with the crowd. Bobby comes back nice and soft for a minute, but once the track hits minute 19, he and Pig really start going hard and having some fun.  What an ending to a show. It's everything I want to hear in a closer.\n\nLovelight is always such a get-up and have-a-good-time song, and you can hear and feel the crowd doing just that. \n\nI wish more of the soundboards would capture the crowd like this.

Both of my parents worked at the FE for Bill Graham (who changed the trajectory of my life) and I was in utero at the time of this show (and many epic others!).

This Eleven is outstanding and I wonder if I was giving my pregnant mother a pre-partum boogie listening to all these immense swirly Jerry Jams\u2026 and perhaps I was destined to get out to follow the Dead and pine away for Bobby Cowboy croons later on in life!
