The real gem for me is the jam out of Uncle Johns. Vince is going nuts and Bruce compliments this by playing some very nice runs up and down the keys. Couple Other One teases too! You can definately tell the band was out to tear the place up on this night. \nOnly negative thing about this show is a couple spots of digi noise during the beginning of drums. It is rather loud and can take away from the experience if the stereo is cranked to begin with.\nI'd give this show 4 stars due to the noise in drums but due to the energetic playing and great set list I'll give it 5!

It's sad the the tuning before Eyes is cut because the band was on stage for a good 7-8 minutes noodling around before they started and Bruce was cutting in some Dark Star riffs even then until about a minute before they start my buddy gauruntees its Eyes.  Still can't believe he called that one.  The other reviews are spot on for this show though.  Beautiful, electric night in Jersey.  Along with 6/14, one of best I saw on 91 summer tour.",

      "review_text": "One for the ages... Truly an impressive show - late era GD at it's best (no small thanks to Bruce for this).\n\nFrom the Eyes opener to the Weight encore, the setlist is a work of art.  The Dark Star theme colors the entire show.  It's ironic that it's the most Dark Star-influenced show I've ever heard, but the song proper is never played; and that's a good thing it keeps the listener on edge and paying attention.\n\nNot that they needed any gimmick this show.  The whole thing rocks.  From the Eyes, to the Loose Lucy, to Masterpiece to the crazy second set, there are some 'best ever' candidates here.  (Def. the best Lucy I know of.)\n\nBut the obvious draw of this show is that it's like one big Dark Star w/o the verses.  They jam on it, tease it, play the whole theme - it's all incredible.  I think my favorite aspect is the way Bruce sneaks the familiar Dark Star riff into several of the songs - when's the last time you heard a DS tease in the middle of Masterpiece?\n\nAll in all, one of my favorite shows ever.

      "review_text": "giants stadium 6-17-91 Probably the best show I attended.  There were massive thunderstorms right before the show.  It absolutely poured.  I remember people running around on the floor (or field) and sliding on the huge blue tarp they used to protect the grass like the whole place was a giant slip and slide.   The energy was nuts.  This was always a crazy place to see a show.  Other people were jumping out of the stands to get to the floor and security was chasing them.  It was quite a show.  Everyone would wait until security was on the other side of the floor and then about fifty people would all go at once.  Security would head to that side, and the other side would use the same strategy. Of course the audience loved it, cheering the crazy fans (Giants has about a ten foot wall and at the time an orange plastic fence that got trampled and torn down)  each time another wave jumped. The the band came out.  They stared tuning and when they played eyes everyone was just looking around with incredulous looks on their faces.  The first set rocked, with huge ovations from the audience each time they teased dark star.  The loose lucy was so rocking, Jerry had a big fan blowing right at him and his hair was blown back into a big mane.  They would shine these white lights on him from behind during the chorus and he was swaying back and forth with this big white halo around his head and wearing a shiteating grin as he belted out \"for a real good time\" It was spine tingling.  Then the might as well.  whew.\nSet two started right with tuning that melted right into space.  The whole set is spaced out with a rare new speedway and the dark star/ other one space.  I haven't heard this source, but David Gans played the whole show on the GD hour so I know great sounding copies exist.  I'm giving it five stars because the show was so awesome and I know my tapes sounded good enough to get at least four stars.  This is my favorite show of 91, but I must admit I'm biased by my memories. D/L it!",

Not one bad song from beginning to end.\n\nThe transitions between songs are remarkable. This is definately one of those shows that shine and all planets were in alignment that evening.\n\nThe mix is great and all instruments complement each other well. Good stereo separation.

The ABC broadcast included the Saint of Circumstance and thats all I can remember.

Mickey and Bill rock, rhythm ride, Jerry moving, smiling staring at Bruce interplayed great while vince had those casio bones slapping along with Bob!  By the way, the DS tease before Masterpiece was all Robert-  Simple A-G progression made sick with his hammer-on pull-off noodling!

This is one of the better Eyes I've listened to in here. I had never been to a show but it looked like so much fun. I got on the bus soon after and was able to catch at least 12 shows; I think? Hey, does anyone have a Morning Dew T-Shirt that looks like the Mountain Dew soda can? I used to have one and wore it out or lost it along the way. I would love to have another:) 5 stars for it being the first kinda live show for me. Sound quality sounds great.",

An \"Eyes\" opener, the fastest, tightest, and best version of \"B.E. Women\" ever played, along with one of the greatest versions of \"Loose Lucy\" and \"Might as Well\". The energy doesnt stop in the second set either. This show makes 6/14/91 look like a bad 95' show. Also, I thought I might add that 8/16/91 sucks. I know why it is popular..Dark Star in first set..big fucking deal. It sucked and so did the whole show on 8/16. One thing about this show though..why is everyone soooo concerned about the \"Dark Star\" teases. So what. A TEASE here in there doesn't make a show a classic. Stop being such lame \"dark star darlings\" and comment on the music that was actually PLAYED instead of a few brief teases.",

      "review_text": "One of Bob's best nights in the 90's.. This is a great example for people trying to figure out what Bob brings to the music, especially if you are just getting into the Dead. I have to admit I jumped the wall right before the Eyes opener but I don't regret it one bit. This was one of the top 3 shows I ever saw and people were dancing and trying to keep up with the pace of the band and some were falling down trying....lol. It was that kind of night. The Eyes opener was not just unexpected but it was a great extended version to. It could have been a short, sweet first set gift but its well jammed out and Bruce (who supposedly asked Garcia to open with it) is having the time of his life on this. Walkin Blues is punchy and Bob does a great job of coming in after that amazing opener. Brown Eyes Women is excellent especially because of Bob. He is working his butt off and very prominent in this mix. The BEW also kept up the energy and pace which Eyes established which is no small feat on this night. Bob kinda steals this version imo. The Dark Star teases are cool simply because this was rare for latter day Grateful Dead. Also, the DS theme throughout the show was really cool if you were there. Masterpiece confirms that this was one of Bob's best nights of the 90's imo. If you love Bob's work than put this show in and turn it up. He is very forward in the mix. Masterpiece has some great work by Bruce and Vince. Loose Lucy is likely the best I ever heard out of 100 shows. Jerry takes the ball from Bob and Bruce really helps Jerry light it up. Cassidy riped on this night and holds up here to what I remember. The exploratory part of Cassidy has Bob, again out in front, and really throwing it down. This show is great because of the way Bob and Jerry trade off licks seamlessly imo. Check them out during the exploratory part of this song. It just goes on and on. One of the best Cassidy's of all time if not the best imo. There is also the ever present noodling that went on this night after Cassidy ends. Lots of noodling by Jerry on this night. The band was just hot to play. Might As Well was great but Vince's voice is a little annoying for me because it comes off louder than Jerry's during the chorus. Bruce key work here is great and the tune is clearly jammed hard and better than the Deer Creek version on 6/6/91 which I also caught.  Amazing enough, the Dead took the energy level UP for the second set. St. of Circumstance is without doubt the best I ever heard live or on tape. The stadium was comin off the chain during this. The only other SOC, in the 90's, that I think touches this one was from MSG 9/16/91. This is a lilting version of Ship of Fools with Bruce just adding awesome touches to it, especially in the first part of the tune. Bob also is very up front in the mix on this version. Thank God Healey did not turn Bob down on this night because we get some of the best work I ever heard Bob do imo. Jerry's solo  soars here and his voice holds up pretty good. This SOF was really the first let up all night from the crazy energy that led up to it. There is a cut in this copy leading into the Dark Star jam. Dark Star was so close on this night, you could reach out and touch it but, alas, it was not to be. Still, I love the drums accompaniment to this tease. It's not a throw away tease and wasn't that night either. That's why people are into the teases. They complimented the songs. This tease led into a blazing Truckin, one of the best I ever heard live. Man, Giants stadium was lit up like a candle during this, Uncle John's Band, Playin reprise, and Sugar Mags like you read about. The Band was so tight on this Truckin that nobody stands out alone. The music was playing the band.  China Doll was spectacular and likely the second best I ever heard live. It's a good rival for the other all-time favorite China Doll I caught from 9/25/91 Boston Garden. This one is a little disjointed while the one from 9/25/91 is a picture perfect version. Vince comes in here with some decent work. Sugar Mags blazed so hard that, ya, people were falling down around me trying to keep up....lol. \n\nI don't know if its me but Phil is hard to pick up on this copy. Everyone else is pretty prominent but Phil seems to be the odd man out. Still, this is a top show from latter day Dead. Grab it!",

Touring through the 80's and early 90's meant that you could count on where the boys would step up to the plate and where they they would dish out an average show. Giants stadium fell into the latter column until today.  After cleaning up a bit in the late 80's (post coma) Jerry decided to slide back into his old ways, and the music in 1990-1991 exemplified that. Today was no exception. Coming out and opening with an outstanding Eyes and dabbling with Dark Star throughout the 1st & 2nd set was a treat we were not used to.

The interplay between Jerry, Bobby, and Bruce is beyond powerful.  I knew I was seeing something special at the time, and although I suspected that something I ingested may have biased me, when I subsequently heard the tapes I just couldn't believe that I had been lucky enough to be there.\nThe Dark Star teases (which incidentally they began the night before)are spectacular. Listen to the one preceding Masterpiece in Set 1 - the way Bobby begins it, followed by Phil, then Jerry, and then Bruce. The jam barely a minute and a half and it moves at a glacial pace.  Yet you can feel the raw energy boiling under the surface waiting to explode.  \nAlso check out the Dark Star(ish) jam from the night before between Black Peter and Throwing Stones.  It's equally powerful.\n\nThe Dead enjoyed a renaissance between 1989 & 1991.  But this show (and much of the previous night) were magic.  18 years later and these are my greatest concert memories.",
