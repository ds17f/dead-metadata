If this doesn't light up your Xmas tree, check your pulse. I never get tired of this show! Excellent playing throughout. There is the fine, fine Dark Star>Eyes>China Doll played on 2/15 and 2/22, and the Dark Star>Stella Blue>Eyes from 10/30. But this Dark Star>Eyes>Stella tops them all for me. Phil is really on, and Jerry is really inspired. Get out this show during the holidaze with Egg Nog! BTW - this is the 3rd longest Star as listed. 5/11 is the longest, anyone know the 2nd longest? My notes say 11/19/72 Dark Star is the runner up. Anyone?\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

I agree, would have been a better DP then the Hixon but it has been in circulation so maybe Dick wanted to introduce us to something new. \n\nEdit 9/17/04> I have been downloading shows like crazy and this one cannot get out of my CD player.  Absolute must get for Jerry jamming.  Also Beware! 1) Phil is turned wayyyyy up at times.  I have had speaker problems because of the ending to the China>Rider. 2) The AUD patch at the end of HC Sunshine is a huge buzz kill.

In any event, I'm a '77 guy by nature, and often less impressed with '73 than most, so I hope my 5-star rating for this gem means that much more.\n\nTo me, it's NOT about the DarkStar, which I think is fantastic and mellow and spacey for about half the length of its 45 minute running time before it devolves into the usual '73 nonsensical meandering noise, but the real gorgeous stuff is to be found in nearly every other song, with the addition of the subtraction of Donna--missing while delivering/caring for child. (BTW: I don't always hate on Donna...it's just nice to hear a show or 2 w/out her sometimes in the way out-of-tune harmonizing).\n\nSo the thing to really watch out for here is the hands-down best-ever jazz-driven epic performance of HERE COMES SUNSHINE, made even better by Jerry really belting out the lyrics, and yes, one of the all-time great CHINA>RIDER's you'll ever hear. Flawless transition into the MLB jam. There's also a dazzling EYES and a simply beautiful rendition of ROW JIMMY that stands with some of the best the band ever played.\n\nThis show is now getting a ton of play and I'm still finding new reasons to love it every time. Just an amazing performance--for any year!",

When I think of \"The Honey Year,\" I think of late '73, and even the late February Winterland shows from the following year. The Dead's sound was just amazing, and this show represents that sound perfectly. The whole show is killer. It has something for everybody, including one of the last truly great Dark Stars, at least of the 70's. Also, the China Cat>Rider is not to be missed, under any circumstances. \n\nI believe the Dead peaked in Nov. and Dec. of '73, and they peaked again in May and June of '77(Gee, could it be because Donna was absent for a majority of Nov/Dec '73, and actually sounded good in '77? Not really. Actually I'm a fan of hers, but it just seems like ripping Donna is the cool thing to do here.). You can't really go wrong with any show from these months, and this show is a perfect example of why.",

(Google \"string theory\")  There are jazzy segments, there's deep space, there's Phil assaulting the audience with one barrage after another (post-verse), there's a segment where they seem to be moving towards The Other One, and there are segments of heartrending beauty.\n\nSome time ago I reviewed a Dark Star that I thought was this one with a review entitled \"More not necessarily better.\"  I don't see my review here now or for any other copy of this show.  Also, I don't understand how I could have been writing about this show, since I wrote something to the effect that Dark Star meandered for a long time before the verse and then dissolved into a mess during which they were barely playing for minutes at a time.  That couldn't be further from the truth here.  They keep up the intensity for the full 43 min, and in fact they could have gone longer.  The one thing I did notice is that Weir either is missing entirely from Dark Star or is mixed so low as to be inaudible.  His guitar reappears at the beginning of Eyes, but disappears again, although his singing is loud and clear.  \n\nChina>Rider is the highlight of a rather blase first set, while HCS is an all-star version, giving a taste of what is to come.  Eyes is fine, but nothing special for that period.  On the strength of the Dark Star, however, this has to get 5 stars.",

      "review_text": "My Review Played through a Yamaha receiver w/direct source into bi-wired Paradigm Monitor 9 speakers.  Sorry boys and girls, but this ones a real sleeper, in fact to quote Jerry its a \"clunker\".  Sound quality is superb with nice clear, rich bass.  This show should be of interest to Phil Zone people (which I am generally not) as Phil is the only guy who showed up here with any enthusiam.  Energy level throughout is generally uninspired, even by Dead standards.  1st set is well played with a decent \"Loser\" and an actually very nice \"China Cat\".  Weir's playing in the transition is real nice in left channel.  My overall problem is the band just doesn't feel like their into it.  Jerry's new ax Wolf is a main highlight of this period of 73' and his fret work is nice in some spots.  HCS has more of a bluesy/funky feel rather than trippy feel which I prefer.  This is not one of the best HCS, but its good.  Phil bombs abound in this show which, for me, is just about the only real highlight here.  I know I'm going to take some heat for this, but honestly this is one of the worst \"Dark Stars\" I have personally ever heard, and I have heard more than a few.  The first 20 minutes are not really the song at all but just some space noodling.  Mercifully Jer drops in the first verse without much fanfare, and then it continues to go nowhere for another 20 some minutes w/ Phil intermittenly assaulting our ears (and my woofers) w/ bass sustain and feedback.  This is generally what musicians do when nothing else is really happening musically.  Bottom line this is basically a great band going through the motions.  Don't get me all wrong this is solid on some basic levels.  However, if your looking for greatness in fall 73' this is not it. Thanks to Charlie Miller and Archives.",

I don't know of another like it. This version is transcendent and essential, a weird tangential musical exploration on a cold December night in Cleveland, Ohio in 1973. \n\nBut deadheaddave in a review from June 2010 disparages this \"Dark Star\", suggests it's listless, flat, uninspired. \n\nAnd quinn_76 calls it \"aimless meandering\".\n\nBoth are right! For themselves. While others, myself included, find something else in it, are powerfully taken by it, we slake our thirst for the Unknown by listening to it. \n\nIs the Mona Lisa smiling in delight or smiling in rueful resignation?

      "review_text": "A Sober(ing) Review: two & a half stars Here's hoping I don't incur too much wrath here, but I have to respectfully disagree with all that's been said about this show, (\u201cdeadheaddave\u201d's below review notwithstanding). Indeed, it is '73 Dead (and even some of the worst played shows of '73 can still hold a robust candle to several top-shelf shows played from other years (even \u201972 & \u201977) in the Dead's stupendous catalog.  Still, one has to give credit where credit is due\u2026 and offer constructive criticism when due.  \n\nTo start, the first set of this show in Cleveland offers a standard menu of ditties that are played with an underwhelming level of gusto and inspiration, all things being equal. Allow me to cherry-pick a few numbers from the first set to illustrate my point. Not unlike many folks, I love the TLEO\u2019s of '73, but this one feels sluggish and phoned-in, and is far inferior to others played this year (look to 2/15, 3/22, 9/7, 11/9, 11/30 for examples).   Bobby Ace's seemingly strained vocals on GSET are not his best offering, and the ending segment of the song never quite broaches the jamming apex of other versions of the year (2/26 & 11/9 come to mind).  The CHINA->RIDER paring to close the first set is executed pleasantly enough, but can one name one in '73 that isn\u2019t? (And there are far superior versions offered from the year: 3/22, 3/16, 11/11, 11/14 come directly to mind....)\n\nThe second set (not surprisingly) offers more ear glitter than the first, but still ultimately leaves something to be desired\u2014based on all the hype it gets.  In order to avoid filibustering the obvious point of discussion for this set, I'll be curt and address the elephant in the room: DARK STAR! Clocking in at nearly 44 minutes, this version on the surface should be every Head's wet dream, and then some.  Well\u2026 perhaps.  Although this particular DS far & away exceeds its quota in terms of length, that doesn't necessary mean it does so in terms of performance.  I\u2019m of the persuasion that the long-winded duration and over-hyped chitter-chatter have blindsided some listener\u2019s objective judgment.  Get the cotton of yer ears folks!  Yes, it\u2019s a very long DS from the greatest band to have graced this earth, but there are many versions that should\u2014and do\u2014rank above this one.  It should go without saying, but nevertheless I\u2019ll divulge: 2/27/69, 2/13/70, 9/19/70, 2/18/71, 4/8/72, 5/11/72, 8/27/72, 9/21/72\u2026 to name a few).  But I digress. Anyway, for this DS on this particular night, a little more focus, and a little less aimless meandering would have made this one a much stronger candidate for the best of 1973. At one point around a 1/4 of the way through this DS, Mr. Lesh tries to inject some adrenaline into this otherwise lifeless beast by plucking Phil bombs in the hopes of making something happen.  It seems as if the boys begin to follow his lead, but it is only fleeting, and the half-baked jam wanders off again into a sedated directionless fixture of sound.  In truth, this version never hits the peaks and valleys of other versions from this year (2/15 & 11/11 are the obvious ones, while10/19 & 12/18 deserve an honorable mention).  The EYES that follows the DS, while good (even the worst Eyes of '73 is still stellar!) is nowhere near the best of the year. (Look to 2/15, 2/22, 5/26, 9/7, 10/19, 10/29, 11/11 for prime candidates). \n\nAgain, not to pee on everyone's parade here, but in a year like 1973, we all need to be ever mindful about being very objective about every show played in this incredible year.  Of course, I\u2019ll concede that this is a decent show (It's 1973, by jove!), but compared to some of its brothers & sisters of the same year, it pails IMHO. \n\nI urge everyone to please listen objectively and perhaps you'll see my point...which is that this show seems to get inordinately praise precisely because of its extraordinarily long DARK STAR, and, in-turn, has garnered much hype, be it warranted or not.  \n\nI have a suspicion some curious listeners unfamiliar with certain shows or year(s) might stumble upon a show like this one, partly because it has so many reviews and it has attracted so much discussion that a snowball effect began to take shape.  If I were less familiar was an era and was looking for a \u201973 show, I might listen to this one first without having the benefit of hearing others, and be blown away by this night bar-none!  After all, it\u2019s a Grateful Dead show played in \u201973, which, all told, is high caliber music.  But if I had already listened to the likes of shows from 2/15, 2/19, 3/22, 3/24, 10/19, 10/21, 11/11, 11/14, 11/17, 11/30, 12/2, 12/18, 12/19\u2026 well\u2026 well\u2026\n\nBut each to his/her own.  My two cents on this one has been written.  BTW, this show is only the second most overrated show of \u201973 IMHO\u2026 the prize for #1 goes to 6/10! \n\nBe kind, love thy neighbor, and listen to the Grateful DEAD!\n\np.s. All grievances aside, I must mention the HERE COMES SUNSHINE from this night.  This version is one to behold, indeed!  This one should be placed among the likes of 12/19, 11/30 & 11/17.",

It's the Dark Star, however, that makes this night stand out as one of those \"if I only had a time machine\" shows. It is majestic and transcendent and I can't imagine what it would have been like to experience it live. It's not for everyone - you have to like going to these dark places and have the time and the mind set to fully immerse yourself in the experience. If that's your thing, though, you won't find any music anywhere as delightfully weird as this!\n\nThe Dead in late 1973 were as hot as they ever got - every show from this tour is strong, and they played each set and song with focus and polish. They had perfected their skills as musicians and performers, and could switch at will from hard-driving, tight rock & roll to that sweet '73 \"honey\" sound to deep space exploration. Phil in particular was super-energetic on this tour, often playing \"lead bass\" and extended jams with mega bombs and feedback. What's so great about this Dark Star is that you get the band at the peak of their powers completely abandoning all reason, logic, and control, letting themselves get taken as far into the void as they ever went.\n\nA funny thing about this Dark Star is it doesn't really start; the tuning after Big River simply dissolves into a series of spacey jams and soon you realize that this is in fact the plan. About 12 minutes in Phil fires the engines and turns the ship out of orbit, until at 17 minutes we have arrived in the deepest, darkest part of the galaxy, a place inhabited by giant, planet-sized beings made of multi-color translucent goo. We wander here for a while, the engines shut down, the ship's sails filled by the cosmic winds. Only at 21 minutes into the song do they actually start *playing* the song, and the melody and first verse is delivered soft and relaxed to fit the mood. We then return to our journey through time, and there follows ten solid minutes of far-out space, ranging from the quietest moments to full-on feedback from all cylinders. At about 36 minutes we start the return trip, passing through more familiar systems on our way back home. This is truly a masterwork of the Grateful Dead's darkest muse.\n\nThe Eyes that follows is a cool, refreshing breeze after such a long trip. It's plenty Dark Starred too - listen as the chaos creeps into the jam at the 9 minute mark and the Dead pull the song back from the brink - must have been fun. \n\nThis is truly an epic show with a Dark Star for the ages. I hope that hundreds of years from now people are still listening to this as reverently as we are now.",

At moments, roughly at the 18-19 minute mark, sounds like Zepellin's No Quarter with the spooky organ sounds. Phil takes over for a good chunk of the latter half of this epic Dark Star. I love a long meandering jam but longest does not necessarily mean best and there are some famously mammoth jams that I've been disappointed in because they seem to lack purpose. And this DS is one of the longest, depending on how you measure it, so I was worried based on some of the reviews that this DS was a lackluster mess. I had to give it a shot and what separates this DS from other long jams that loose energy is that there are seamless transitions between all the wonderful worlds through which this DS travels--yes, travels through many distant galaxies and dimensions of space (our minds). The DS Starts slow, mellow, spacey, this section underlined by Keith's wonderful organ playing as mentioned above, then into the verse, a tad tentative, but definitely fitting the super-spacey vibe. Then Phil lays it down hard--actually a wonderful section--not as unlistenable for the uninitiated as I had suspected it would be. Then they bring back together for the Eyes. Which isn't as great as 11/11/1973, my personal favorite Dark Star->Eyes ever and definitely some of the Dead's best 50 minutes every played on stage. But this Dark Star has gotta be a candidate for spaciest ever. Wonderful stuff!\n\nAs stated by many others, the Here Comes Sunshine is also perfect. Rivals 12-19.
