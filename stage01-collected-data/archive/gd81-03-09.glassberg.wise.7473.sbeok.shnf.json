This was my first ever dead show, and I regret I did not turn on to the Dead until the early 80's when I was in my early 20's. The amazing thing about this, is I had NO idea how great this show was, as I had nothing to compare it to. I went to 40 or 50 more shows over the years, and listening to this one, this is absolutely a top 10, if not a top 10 show from this time period.

Jerry and the band really take the jam into to some interesting places, reminding me of the jazz-like jams of the '73-'74. Jerry is in good form on China Cat, and the jam into Rider is top notch Dead. Jerry continues the momemtum into Rider. Samson is also killer, as is Estimated. The jam into Uncle John's Band beautiful, morphing into some interesting territory, powerful, then introspective. Then yet another great jam in Uncle John's. Wow. But wait, there's more. We get a blistering Other One and a clean, rockin' close.\n\nI'd rate this show's performance at 4 for the first set, 5 for the second (sound 4.8). The 3/5/81 show is solid 5 because the first set is stronger (has more outstanding first-set material). But this show has plenty of fabulous Dead to go around. And, like the 3/5 show, Archive.org lets us download it. Download them both.",

This version here to open the 2nd set is with no doubt one of the best of all time. The China jam does not know when to quit and takes so many different paths on it's way to developing into an absolutely rockin' version of Rider.  In the Rider Jerry slips in a solo between the \"Sun gonna shine\" and \"Wish I was a headlight\" verses, that is not only very well-placed but it also completely rips.  As others have posted this show does have much more than this China>Rider. The Estimated>UJB combination is worth the download on their own, and the whole 1st set is all real good stuff. The Stranger may be best all-time, there is a fantastically rockin' ROR, a sweet version of Bird Song and then the 1st set closer Minglewood rocks with a very cool Brent guitar synth solo. \n\nA great show that is well worth the download.",

And then, the whole crowd is getting into it and  yelling for china cat over and over and over, like we we're not going to take NO for an answer. And Jerry starts cracking up, with that 1/2 bent over gait swaying, if you've ever been to a show and seen Jerry when he can't stop laughing at the crowd and the crowd laughing at him. (or, like maybe you were at Red Rocks the second night in 1987 and saw him cracking up at me after the 1st song HIAB?)\n\nI was in the shadows of the Tree's of Life and Knowledge at this MSG show after going into a total blackout into total white light during the first set.. long story.....",
