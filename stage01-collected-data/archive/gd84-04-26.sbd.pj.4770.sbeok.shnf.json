I have to give it as 4 because it is not the Betty quality or super-duper clean- see my reviews by clicking on my name and you will see shows that are true 5star shows. I have downloaded over 300 shows since September and have listened to a lot of dead. \n\nI am a fan of the scarlet>fire sequence and this one will not dissapoint. Suprising to me was how powerful the Morning Dew is!  Yeah sure it was 1984 and Jerry was a little unhealthy then, but jerry does his best and that is all I can ask for- the emotion and the rip roarin jamming is spectacular.

      "review_text": "The Goo From the sinister buzzing of Brent's Hammond B-3 that introduces a typically THICK '84 Shakedown through the molassas of sound and thunder in the AM Dew>OMSN set 2 closer, your SF heroes lay it on the line in Providence.  \n\n4/26/84, a great example of where the band was at this point in their history.  Entering stage right with a deep jammed Shakedown, Brent asserting his prominence and Jerry just whipsawing through a variety of guitar leads, you'll be catching your breath through a slide leaking CC Rider.  Loser and Deal are the other two high points of Set 1, the latter just crackles with sparkle and fire.\n\nAnd speaking of fire ... While the Scar>Fire, Est>Eyes is not exactly the most original 2 by 2 pre drums song selection, each is an outstanding version.  Fire, with its clunky and key tickling ferocity, the Estimated that bursts out of the vocal portion and into an outer space outro Jam, the light speed eyes that really only clocks in at about 8 minutes (possibly one of the shortest on record) as if the whole band has been blasted out of a 100 dollar bill if you know wha I'm sayin ...  The back end is notably thicker, and Jer lays that heart o' gold on the line in AM Dew.  \n\n'84 SBDs are not that common, (if you scroll through the archive, I'd say 35-40 percent of the '84 shows are SBD offerings) so take advantage and partake of this oddly maligned and underappreciated year.",

      "review_text": "Jerry's floatin in a persian haze One of my fav Shakedown's and Loser's. Also hot Scarlet>Fire. Brent breaks out Never Trust for the the first time since 82' and only played it 1 other time in 1984. Yea, I can imagine eveyone dosed out in Rhode Isand at the Civic never been but I would imagine its a nice venue 14,000 cap. The scene is just about ripe for the pickin'. Heavy party atmoshere before huge mid to late 80's success. All the rumors and his actual herioned out stage presence along with neck break speed trippy jams and emotional singing on his ballds were over the top. I would of been eating it all up. They were crushin it night after night and the Scene was going Gonzo.\n Iam big on Brent's deep penetrating lingering buzzers he was using it heavy spring 84' and through the 84 tour. He wasn't pulling those sounds out his library much past 1985. Very prevelant on this Shakedown esp. the begining.  Brent means  business right of the start, fuckin up all the cosmic Heads in the crowd. The first I really noticed that sound when I started trading tapes in 87'. Listening to the Hult 84' Terrapin and Scarlet and thinking wow this is  I OUT THERE. I remembering dosin with friends and talk about seeing sound jeeez  those psychedelic soundz coming out of Brent's \"gOoey B-3\" mentioned below (although I thought it was some synth making those electronic arcade effects.) and we traded alot of 84 stuff because of what Brent was up to. \n*Ps. Very nice crisp board top notch sound* \n     this is my favorite stuff, High Qual. sound and killer and I mean killer 84'shows.  \n The Spring Marin run and Fall Augusta shows are book-ends of a smokin tour. The Summer tour starting off with East coast fav Saratoga and Merriweather love the midwest run           \n Ohio,Indianna,Mi,Mo,Ia,Alpine and of coarse the Greeks and Ventura. It don't stop the fall tour starting with Charlotte and Richmond were starting to get cooking and one of my fav's the smokin' hot Augusta run. The Hatrford's and Bct's are all sick. \"Tell me this tour aint got no hart\" TOP notch Dead, I never will understand the neg. 84' sentiment the Junkie Jerry stuff Good Ole' Grateful Dead stops at 82 I don't think so. They played and sounded awesome, fun to listen to and I wasn't there but I know the scene was about as cool as your gonna get. As mentioned below this is a grate example of what was going down.\n    ~HaPpY tRaiLs~",

      "review_text": "Excellent example of the 84 sound and style The archive has been great for reaquainting me with periods that I had been ignoring since the advent of CD trading.  Most of my interest for the last few years has been on the 69-74 span which I still see as the Dead at the peak of their powers.  \nBut select dates and even whole tours during the 83-84 span in particular bear further investigation.  Fall 83 was my first live dead experience and this show in Providence happened to be my second.  Thanks goes to the quality of some of the reviews  for resparking my appreciation of this period.\nProvidence was a great place to see the boys although the cops could be a little intense.  My memories of this one include being to the left of the stage, 4-5 rows up from the floor.  Providence is intimate compared to the later venues and it was always loud!  Great light show!  As we begain to take off on our journey I remember my buddy Mark experiencing a bit of a crisis.  The Shakedown opener was big, fat and loud.  It was dark and aggressive but also very funky.  Listen to it very loud for best effect.  I remember feeling like we were witnessing the Leviathin feeding on the urban sprawl that surrounded us.\n    The set closing Lazy Lightening ->Supplication->Deal was brighter and more uplifting and marked the end of Mark's bum out.  We loosened our seatbelts and started to really boogie.\n The set II Scarlet->Fire  completed the swing back from the dark side and transported us to a happy place somewhere above the urban decay.  I have fleeting memories of a long space arriving at a thunderous Morning Dew.  \n  Listening to this show 20 + years later knowing what I now know about Jerry's battles I am amazed at the peaks they were still able to reach.  83-84 Dead was loud and had an edge to it.  Brents synth and organ left no holes in their sound.  The band still liked to stretch out.  This Shakedown opener clocks in at 14 minutes.  Jerry's voice doesn't sound great and there are certainly plenty of miscues but overall this show struts with alot of attitude. \nWe made it back to MA that night by some act of divine intervention.  Two happy but very disoriented individuals picked up on the outbound exit by a friend of a friendof a friend  who just happened to be going to the same town.  Isn't it amazing how that always seemed to happen after shows?!  We made it to class the next morning a bit dazed but very satisfied. \nIf you are wondering about this period (84) give this one a listen.  It remains one of the better shows that I witnessed and predates the aproach they took once top 40 popularity hit in 86/87.  I hope that someone will upload a FOB pcm audience of this show someday.  I still prefer a crispy audience to a board.",

After some purple micro-dot in the parking lot we worked our way into the civic center; I remember hearing the band start Shakedown Street as we were making our way to the floor and the energy just go through the crowd--especially when Jerry hits the wa wa pedal with that crazy symbol sound like I'd never heard skakedown played before or after this show-it's great to hear it here again after 26 years! Snakedancers were really groovin in the hallways during the whole show. Fans rushed the doors that night after we got in(we read it in the newspaper the next morning); many were arrested outside the joint but everyone that got in experienced a great show!

      "review_text": "Sliver linings You'll like this one. Great Sound \n\nGood peaks and valleys in the first set Shakedown will get the jitter out, CC will leave you stoned, but Loser is the strongest out of all of them. Jerry's voice is for sure declining at this point (sound like he's been hitting the sticks hard) but it sure does paint the scene of the worn out rambling man making ends meet. HIAB is not the most furious but still up beat and moving, you can hear the arrangement becoming more worked out; lots of dynamics. BEW transports you back in time when the milk was cheap and a man could make it in the world with his bare hands. You can hear the time in their voices and under their fingers, upbeat and with a sort of \"candy\" bop to it. LSD combo pack served up in the best way an early 80s Dead can only a couple of vocal flubs but hey we all make mistakes. Supplication is mushy and almost translucent, red hot Jerry licks are in full swing. Deal, always a crowd favorite I don't think there is a year where Jerry sounds bad on this tune just one of those songs that delivers IMO. This particular one lacks a certain vocal energy Jerry's voice sounds tired. Always liked Brent's harmonies on this tune, B3 coming in ready! Great guitar work as expected who doesn't love fuzz. Over all a very enjoyable 1st set.\n\nSecond set Scarlet/Fire (check out the 4/20 Philly show for another hot one!) opener followed by an Estimated > Eyes a heads dream! An hour of unfiltered pulpy juice with a heavy dose of love and appreciation for the experience of life and music. Some folks talk about originality of pairing... but when you have something that works why fix it? Haven't really heard many Never Trust A Woman's, a dirty blues number reminiscent of \"That Same Thing\". Brings you back into your shoes; always appreciated and well earned before the mind meld of Drums/Space...a groovy 2/3 clave' starts us out with a serious tone. The Rhythm Devils have entered and you let them in graciously! Space finds us somewhere in the stratosphere slow drifting along like clouds forming over a distant ocean. large, ominous, and playful. Blooming from the inner void comes a flaky Morning Dew. Light and fluffy rythmn allowing Jerry's searing notes flow. definitely mind-altering. I personally dislike the effects Healy is putting on. The reverb can be tasteful, but the delay is not me for me. Total 180 with Throwing Stones almost makes you wonder how did we get here? Bobby rager bruh. Bobby closing out the show giving the people what they want, heavy rocking Fade Away. No Baby Blue unfortunately\n\nIm not sure why people shrug off 84' such a smokin' year (yes there are some bad ones can't be perfect...just gotta poke around amirite?) but I do believe this show is worth the listen!!",

      "review_text": "Only time I tripped at a show I was that odd Deadhead. A Republican sober one, and about to turn 20 in a few days. I saw every show for the week culminating in Nassau 4/29/84.\n\nI went to this show with an acquaintance and a bunch of his friends who rented a huge white van (a nice one, like a Sprinter).\n\nGD music and shows and tapes were the priority for me in those days (and the music still is). I stayed sober for shows because I wanted to experience everything without having my senses filled.\n\nThis night the people I was with talked me into taking mushrooms. I took a lot. It was for me a mistake, but made for an interesting experience and now funny memories.\n\nThe mushrooms kicked in all at once as the set break came to an end. We were halfway back in the hall, a few rows up in the loge.\n\nI got very claustrophobic so I went up into the hallway and made circles through the auditorium through Space.\n\nI could hear the band thundering, of course, and the music was a comfort. I somehow managed to get a Coke and kept going into bathrooms and splashing myself with cold water. I remember the rivulets the water made on my face and arms and watched the water roll around and evaporate. I was keenly aware that I had veins and blood and really wanted to see them. Thankfully I did not do anything but think about this.\n\nI kept walking around. My vision would go one-dimensional and I would lose depth perception. People 20 meters from me and 20 millimeters away were the same, so I kept crashing into people (and I am 6\u20198\u201d). \n\nFinally, Morning Dew started out and I went back inside. I could see a massive Purple Heart pulsating on the ceiling with an umbilical cord leading from the top of everyone in attendance\u2019s head to the heart.\n\nThe show ended leaving me wondering how I was going to get back to Amherst. I was really worried. I went out into the night and CARS! Oh my goodness\u2026 CARS EXIST! I was yelling it and celebrating this fact to all around me.\n\nNot surprisingly given my state, I crawled into the first white van I came across. I remember two pretty Deadhead girls asking me who I was and why I was climbing into their van. I looked around and saw that the van was very unkempt and realizing I was in the wrong van, hopped out.\n\nI found my van with those patient almost strangers telling me I shouldn\u2019t take mushrooms again LOL.\n\nJerry in extra-fine form this night and the next. Spring 1984 was a good time for me. I kept going to shows through 1994, never again under the influence of anything but the music and the magic of life.",

Billy races back to his kit just as Jerry begins singing. Felt kind of bad to watch it. Great ending jam though! All 3 Dews have good ending jams, especially Hampton. Check it out too! Philly has a nice ending jam as well, but there is a severe Garcia vocal flub after the first solo, that kind of deflated me as it was happening, and still doesn't enhance that version 37+ years later.
