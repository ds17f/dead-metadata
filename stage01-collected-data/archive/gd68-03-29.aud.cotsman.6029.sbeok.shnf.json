Sure, there are flaws, but to hear something this good from a 40 year old audience cassette tape recording shows the technical wizardry of those who remixed and downloaded it.  Thank you whoever you are.  It is rare to find a stand alone version of \"Dark Star\" (i.e. not part of a larger jam) and this one is extremely good.  Definitely worth a CD; better if you combine it with tracks 3-9 of the 3-30-68 Carousel Ballroom show.",

      "review_text": "Newly resurrected songs from 1966: Resurrected Death, Sittin\u2019. Grade A Dead True, this is not as good as some the material from January and February (check out 1/20 and 2/14/68). But, this show is as good as some of this material, and is better than the historic 3/3/68 Haight Street concert. Each of the 4 songs really is top notch. 1968 is a great year.\n\nSome think of \u201968 Dead as ancient history, but this show is a throwback to an earlier era with the resurrection of Sittin\u2019 on Top of the World: this is the first time they played it since mid-1966. Phil says \u201cWe never did that one very good even when we were doing it.\u201d I have to disagree, as this and 1966 versions are great stuff. The band began to play it regularly again in 1969.\n\nThis show also resurrected the 1966 Death Don\u2019t Have Now Mercy: they had only played it twice in the past year. After the performance, it became part of the regular rotation.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the Dead began digging up oldies: They had been playing the Anthem of the Sun material almost exclusively during the past 7 or 8 months (with Dark Star>China Cat>Eleven thrown in only in the couple of months).  The Anthem recording sessions where now just about over, and they were looking for other things to play.\n\nJerry is expressive vocally and strong on guitar in this Death, which is faster than it was a year later. The Schoolgirl here is also good: Pigpen is in form and the rest of the band is jamming, not vamping. This song sometimes got repetitive, but this one is fresh sounding.\n\nDark Star is mellow and dreamy. I like it better than the 1971 Dark Stars. The Dark Star ending is unusual for this time. They had been playing Dark Star>China Cat>Eleven for the past few months.\n\nI like this show (or show fragment). I usually rate the performance, not the recording, but this audience recording is pretty decent.",

      "review_text": "good sound, misdated tape Dick Latvala attributed this \"3/26/68\" recording to the 3/29 Carousel show.\nI'm not positive about this - no songs are duplicated, but the sound isn't quite the same. The \"3/26\" tape has much less echo than the later Carousel recordings. (I think the sound here is quite good.)\n\nIn any case, this \"3/26\" show is definitely NOT from the Melodyland in Anaheim, as the Archive file claims! (Though the band had played there earlier that month.) The Dead, as far as we know, did not play the Carousel or anywhere else on March 26. So presumably the \"3/26\" tape comes from one of the Carousel dates of 3/29 to 3/31 - though it could be from any unattributed show that month.",
