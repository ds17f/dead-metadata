      "review_text": "Feedback opener I was at this show and they did open with feedback, which spurred more than a few people to leave the building. Not me.  This was my first Dead concert, the weekend after I got out of the Army I wandered into the Filmore East and got my mind blown. It was truly a wild and magical night. I had listened to the Dead and had the first album, but they weren't my favorite band by any stretch. I was actually more into the Airplane at that time.\n\nThe Jeff Beck group was on before the Dead and they blew the doors off the place. We're talking about Rod Stewart, Jeff Beck, Nicky Hopkins, Ron Wood, and Ansley Dunbar on drums. The band was tight, powerful, and played an outstanding 2-\u00bd hour set, including an incredible version of Morning Dew. The band was so good they were written up in either Time or Newsweek because of their performance and were being compared to Rolling Stones by at least one of the critics. \n\nThe Dead opened with very weird and wild Feedback and then settled into a jam which was so different from what the previous group played that it didn't invite any comparisons. In fact, it was hard to believe it came from the same universe. I remember how blown away I was, having never seen them before and how weird it was. The stage seemed kind of dark and grungy, like a scene out of \"Wharf Rat\" or something. Other than the feedback, I don't remember much about the specifics of the Dead's show. Now, it's all floating visions of the band, the audience, the light show and bits of songs, Alligator, St. Stephen, Lovelights. I\u2019d never heard any of these songs before so it was all new to me.\n\nAt that time, the music seemed so wild, strange and energetic to me, and probably also to the scores of people who left the theatre during the set because the music was so weird. Listening to it now, even after seeing the Dead numerous times and hearing hundreds of recordings, I realize it really was as wild and unbridled as I remember. In fact, it is considered to be one of the wildest shows the Dead ever put on (see Deadlists description). I didn't realize how unique that first show was until I started going to more shows. Then I started thinking, wow, that first show really was pretty crazy. \n\nWhat I remember most was the way they looked. Just coming back form a year and a half stationed in Germany, I had heard about the San Francisco scene and I had some albums, but seeing Garcia in full Captain Trips garb, Weir with that long, long hair he used to have, Lesh with his little round hippie sunglasses, the two drummers, and 'Pig' looking like some biker dude who just dropped in to jam with the hippies, this was San Francisco to me. It all made for or an outstanding evening and helped to make me a lifelong Deadhead (and move to SF within a couple of years). Since the second show didn't start until midnight, it was nearly dawn when it finally ended. It was truly a memorable night. But then again, that' true for most people's first Dead show.\u00a0",

Do any of you other tapers ever daydream about getting in a time machine w/ you current taping rig, and going back to this era, ahhhhh what dreams are made of. We ARE ALL so lucky to have this. Anyways, in the past 6 months or so i have watched my GDead collection go from very large, to absolutly HUGE. Thank you so much Archive.org, this has been a long time coming, and we truly do appriciate all the work that went into this. \n This show is IMHO the best of 68, and in the top 5 pre 70 shows i own. I wasnt aware of the fact that the Jeff Beck Band opened the show, thanks for that info, does anyone know where I can find the Jeff Beck band set? Or if it even exists in circulation.\nshow gets a 5\nquality gets a 3\noverall a 4 (which is hard to get in my book, this is REALLY a good one kids, so go get it)\n\nDarkstr56 (wka/the Darkest Star of all)",

I don't know any '68 show with a longer or better Caution/Feedback or such unique transitions (Space>The 11>St.Stephen and especially Alligator>Lovelight>Caution!). 6/19/68 was very far out, like this show, but this one is more coherent in terms of the setlist. \nAlthough the performances and setlist are both top-notch, the sound quality is positively abysmal. The drums and Bobby are almost inaudable, Phil barely audible, and the vocals buried. Jerry is the only member that can be heard relatively clearly. But hey it was 1968, and live recording technology was primitive. \nBut listen to this several times and it grows on you. 'Nuff said.",

Sounds to me more like somebody'd turned them on to some MC5, Stooges or Velvet Underground, or maybe just some really raunchy drugs.  If that sounds good, download now.

I have always preferred \"Feedback\" to what became the infamous and in some cases obligatory \"Space\". This show offers an opening screamer feedback and the well known (somewhat melodic) closing feedback that offtimes led to We Bid You Goodnight.

      "review_text": "FYI.... ...just thought I should tell you that the SBD for this legendary show has finally turned up!\n\nWell, somewhat at least...the bonus CD included with the Live Dead Boxed Set (as well as orders from gdstore of the 3-CD compilation from the Fillmore '69 shows) begins with a metal-melting \"Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\" that is cryptically labelled as being from \"6/68\" with no further information.  Given that the CD purports to be comprised exclusively of material taken from Carousel Ballroom and Fillmore West shows between '68-'70 (and given that June '68 is a notorious gap in our recorded record of the GD) you'd be forgiven for thinking this comes a previously unknown show - after all, Deadlists shows a series of shows from the Carousel at the beginning of June.\n\nIt doesn't!  It actually comes from this classic 6/14/68 Fillmore East show, something that was instantly apparent to me (it fades in as Jerry is bringing the band out of \"Lovelight\").  And it sounds absolutely FANTASTIC in remastered, crystal-clear SBD.  \n\nUnfortunately, according to David Lemieux it is the only fragment of the show that exists on the tape - the rest has been wiped.  Heartbreaking, really, that the rest of this seems to have been permanently lost to SBD, but if you want to hear the great \"Caution\" > \"Feedback\" sequence from this most classic of Primal shows, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on a copy of that bonus disc.\n\nAs for this AUD, I've reviewed it once already, and my five stars remains five stars now.",

AUDS of this vintage are an acquired taste, but having attempted taping a few in the early 70's, this is far better than anything I was able to accomplish. Thanks to those responsible. Thanks also for the info. pertaining to the \"bonus\" disc. A solid 4 stars. Check it out.",

It's as though you've been handed a secret that gets passed about in shadows and only acknowledged through nods.  The band doesn't just open, they open the Maw of Time and push you in.  Even on this dirty distorted hand me down tape, the impact pulses through.  Perhaps it's because of the lo-fi that I love it so much, but a crappy recording of a great show aces the inverse.  The Caution is a bit too much to take and the feedback inevitable. In the end there is no gentle let down back to earth, no lullaby or singalong.  There is only the humming of your cells reconstructing themselves back into a familar form that differs in some intangible way...\n\nI can't imagine how many destinies this little show changed.\n\nHighly recomended\nUse wisely",

The feedback>Eleven>St. Stephen is a rare combination. \n\nAlligator transitioning into Lovelight is also unusual. The Alligators is good, but it\u2019s not an exceptional Lovelight, though, as it gets stuck in the middle. \nCaution is great. The ending feedback seems to have form and structure, with a beginning and conclusion: a musical composition.\n\nThe audio is pretty bad terrible.

      "review_text": "Feedback opener? Just wondering about this.  I had an old discussion with Jim Stevens (?) about this at gdlists.  On my old cassette tape of this show I was aware that the Feedback at end of tape made a pretty seamless transition to the Feedback (supposedly) at the beginning of the tape.  This led me to believe that the Feedback didn't open the show but was somewhere buried deep in the guts of the show.  I'm guessing somewhere along the line tape copiers fit what they had of this monumental show as best they could on to a 90 min. tape.  I always wanted to make my own tape combining the (end-of-tape) Feedback with the (beginning-of-tape) Feedback to make a complete Feedback.  Maybe someone who has the bonus CD can verify the length/completeness of my Caution>Feedback (not the opener but all there at once) theory.\nThanks and Grateful Blessings to all.  My first show was one night of either5/31 or 6/1/1968. They opened with Mornin' Dew.",

Thoroughly enjoyed and am happy to have this Aud. Tape but sure would love to find the rest of the soundboard that obviously exists.\n\nI did compare the SBD 30:07 long version of Caution to what was on this aud. tape and found the following:\n\nThe SBD includes approximately the last 20 seconds of Lovelight, the full 24:28 of Caution, the 4:00 of Feedback and approximately 50 seconds of additional crowd noise, Bob thanking the crowd, Phil saying good night and Bill Graham introducing the band members including Bill Summers aka Kreutzmann.\n\nSo I'm thinking the show did open with Feedback or it was at least not tied to the last Caution/Feedback. \n\nBtw, just love this Caution/Feedback. A definite highlight in a show that is just one big highlight!!!!!",

In those days, we didn't know what might happen--we hadn't heard the post Anthem material-- so we stayed on the same side of the tape to begin set 2. They came out and played a truncated Dark Star--maybe 8 minutes. The unprepared audience did not care for this noodling thing--they wanted rock and roll. The band basically stopped and, after a brief pause, went into Feedback. We flipped the tape just in time. It's been 45 years. I have no idea where the rest of the cassette is or why only the second side survived. The tape is weak, but the show was great.",

      "review_text": "The audience tape archetype of incendiary \u201868 insanity. This howling, ripping, roaring thunderclap of a show stands testament to the brilliance of what the acid test house band was up to in 1968. Only a fraction of their performances from that year were recorded, but we can listen to what\u2019s available and infer that it may very well have been the best year in Grateful Dead history. Was 6/14/68 typical of the year? It's difficult to say with such a small sample size. But when you stack it against its Anthem-era siblings from the winter Pacific Northwest tour and the October Avalon shows, their Fillmore East debut is undoubtedly on the more extreme side; frothing out boiling feedback and detonating Phil bombs of mercurial magnitude, throwing Caution, reason, and limits to the New York wind.\n\nUnlistenable for some, irresistible for others, this is one hour of gourmet psychedelic primal dead.\n",
