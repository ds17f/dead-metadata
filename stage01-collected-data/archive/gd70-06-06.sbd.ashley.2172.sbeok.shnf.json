The sound isn't fantastic, but still sounds sharp for a 34 year old recording. There are a few cuts here and there, but over all, well worth a listen. Also, its Pigpen heavy!!",

      "review_text": "Q+A with the Bear This is the only Fillmore West mid-1970 Alligator listed on the archive.\nI went to 6 Fillmore West Dead shows in 1970, and at one of them they started \"Alligator\" with kazoos.\nGarcia played a solo very similar to the one that begins the jam on Feb. 14, 1968 (Anthem of the Sun). \nI remember Garcia turning up the volume and the sustain resulting from his slight touch on the bottom E string (again, similar to what you hear on Anthem of the Sun).\n\nCould Alligator have been played at the August 17, 1970 FW show - for which the set list is incomplete and only Casey Jones was recorded? \n\nI do remember Garcia opening a set with a chilling version of \"Morning Dew\", likely this is it. \n\nI emailed Owsley, Bear to find out more about circulating tapes missing moments from the Fillmore West 1970 shows. \n\nOwsley replied:\n\n\"No the truth is, all the tapes you refer to are bogus-\nfakes, as are 90% of all 'rare' shows and virtually all early shows supposed to be 'soundboards'.  \nThe thing is, the Dead played thousands of shows, and \nmostly in halls which sounded a lot alike.  They had a\nwide but repetitive repertoire, and it is child's play to\nassemble virtually any kind of 'set list' from any taper's extensive and varied collection of tapes.\n\nIf you, personally, did not actually, on your own\nmachine- record a given show, there is literally no way it can ever be proven to you to be from any particualar show.  Thus all that huge taper\nscene is generally of interest only so far as the tape  is\nlistenable, and had zero historic significance- that falls only to the archival tapes recorded by the band's successive soundmen and kept in the GD vault.\n\nTrust me, I NEVER have given any copies of my sonic\njournals to anyone and no one else recorded the shows, from my board OR in the audience- we did in fact from time to time confiscate tapes and machines.  Cassette recorders, especially stereo ones, were very \nrare, reel to reel machines bulky, and also expensive-\nlive taping in the audience simply did not happen back then, however there are tapes \nfloating around which even claim to be of shows which\nwere cancelled and never happened...\"\n\nQuote -unquote...\n\nThis was a great show imo, no matter what few seconds are missing. June 7th may have an edge over this one so check that one out as well. \nIf I had to choose from experience rather than sound quality or availability of circulating tapes, the June (and August) '70 are the best Grateful Dead shows of the ones I attended. \nJune 4th and August 17th are available, with various songs and banter missing. \nOh well, maybe you had to be there to want to hear bits again, such as the Bob Weir banter, \"Stand on your heads\"  in response to the inter-audience catcalls to sit down/ stand up.  \nP.S.\nIn answer to Chris U's question below,\nhe may have issues about compensation for his historic recordings, or it could be he'd like to have the last word on the dates and locations of shows that he taped. He also mentioned not being sent comps of recent CDs that he contributed to. \n\"Alice D. Millionaire\" maybe, maybe not.",

      "review_text": "great 1970 gem! This is worth getting if, for no other reason, that there are so few good SBD's from the summer of 1970. Just to give some historical perspective - this was only one month after the Kent State OH student deaths (murders) which lent a large measure of uncertainty, paranoia and intensity to a year that was already a major turning point for the peace movement, the counterculture and also the rock music world. Should we retreat to the country, buy guns, or continue trying to change things?\nThe Grateful Dead, born from the same Haight Ashbury mother that created much of the counterculture - both politically and artistically - could not help but be influenced by all that was happening around them. As is evident from their comments to the crowd at Harper College, 5/2/70 (Dick's Picks #8). The legends are true - go buy it!!\nSo these shows are a pleasant rarity from a very important year in Dead history, as they began to change their sound from the cosmic distortion of a 1969 Dark Star to the acoustic flavor of FOTD and Cumberland.\nI don't know what to make of Owsley's comments below. I have dozens of 68 - 70 shows where Bobby or the band is talking to Bear from the stage about monitors. And if Bear didn't let these shows out, then who did? C'mon. Many of these shows in question have been long in circulation, long discussed on internet forums, verified in Deadbase, and have even been leaked or traded or commented on by people close to the Dead (I'm not naming names but you know).\nSo if all these show dates/lists are bogus - as Bear claims, then someone would have surely caught it by now, as anal as all us collectors are, LOL. I suspect Bear is either pulling our collective legs, or he's dipped too deeply into his Kool Aid!\nNow - to this show. I must say that, after the great 1969 run at the Fillmore West in Feb-Mar, I see these shows from the Fillmore in 1970 and think, \"wow, these gotta be just as good\". Wrong. Maybe they were still tired from their England trip (5/24) only 2 weeks ago. But trying to compare 1970 in general to 1969 is like oranges and apples. And not fair really. 1969 was the apothesis of the \"old Dead\" and 1970 was, at times, a shaky rebirth of a new kind of Dead.\nIf I were doing a box set of these 3 shows, I would include much of 6/5, esp. the Other One which is quite good despite the nasty cut at the end. And also the acoustic set from 6/7, which is also good. But this show overall is my favorite. A nice Morning Dew starts the electric set, and the Dancin is slow but well done. Then Jerry gets things warmed up with a great early China>Rider where the long jam transition harkens forward to 1972 - 1974 versions.\nNew Orleans (the 1st) works well and is a nice surprise. One wonders why they didn't develop it further. Jerry and the drums really kick it. Then a super rare Attics, wow! Not album perfect, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better one in 1970 where the vocals are this stunningly good.\nThen on Disc Two things really get down to business, as they enter the old familiar 1968 territory of Alligator and Lovelight. After the Drums, Garcia takes the helm with a long firey 14 minute jam. The drummers lock into synch and play with precision and thunder. This is a monster jam, almost Dark Star territory. Then Pigpen takes over and delivers another great sermon on how to get laid, Dr. Ruth in a cowboy hat! The NFA> Lovelight seque is strong, but unfortunately cut at the end. But the fine UJB closer makes up for it.\nFor some reason, the Dead seemed to play their most inspired 1970 shows at the Fillmore EAST, not West. But this show is still worth having. A lot of fun and a bookmark in the Dead's 1970 summer of transition. The addition of the missing acoustic set would make this an even better, well rounded classic.\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

There are plenty of tapes, both from audience and soundboard sources, floating around from that period. While a few are undoubtedly mislabeled or composites assembled from other shows, obviously many are not. Like any  eyewitness to any event, his memory is subject to become more faulty with each passing year; the fact that \"he was there\" doesn't hold much weight 30-plus years later. Just 'cause Bear says it's so doesn't make it so.",

Deadlists says Darkness, but check out the 11-20-70 show with Jorma etc for the 'only' known version performed (really sung IMHO).  Either way it's a gem tucked neatly inside a fantastic, late post-Alligator.",
