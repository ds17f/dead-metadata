      "review_text": "We were on the bus <br />The final show is notorious for being a stinker. In the grand scheme, yes, but for '95 it's not terrible \u2013 in fact it's better than the night before. Oddly, there are many reviews here that rank it as one of the top shows ever [five stars]. In the '80s &amp; '90s critics who disparaged the Dead often claimed that the band was popular because their fans lacked the ability to discern good from bad. Now we see that for a minority that is accurate (or the concept of a star-rating show comparison system is a stumper \u2013 a number of reviews offer \"Worse show ever, I give it five stars.\"). If this is one of the best shows, I can't imagine your pick for a  2 or 3 star show (that boot of Mickey grocery shopping?). Or maybe a scene noted for its non-conformists still has a few that feel a cosmic imperative to stick it to the man (such as it is) and disrupt a collective, objective rating system \u2013 even though it's a valuable tool for listening purposes (and audio archiving itself); to brusquely corrupt and devalue the rating tool so that we have no way of judging which of the 1,950 shows are da kine and which are relative time sinks. Admittedly, input for a show of such historical import is going to be frenzied and varied; at some vectors it will naturally be challenging to divorce subjectivity from the goals and objectives of a Dead audio archive.

There are lots of flubs in a sloppy <i>Lazy River Road</i>, but then a full jump in quality for <i>Masterpiece</i>, the set's best, with Bobby on acoustic. That energy is quashed with <i>Childhood's End</i>, the soft rock sapfest that never fully formed. There are 3 in '95 and 11 total, and even though a bit confused, this is about as good as it got. There's a So Many Roads tease, but instead it's a shaky-to-average <i>Cumberland. Promised Land</i> is also flubby but Vince is good and the end solo is okay. They bail, for a short set.\n\nSecond Set. Many reviews mention heroin, though Jer was a maintenance user and played worse without it; and even though tobacco, diabetes and fast food killed him, pat, illusory truth is preferred, in perfect societal reflection. Regardless, health status is factorable in a flubby, lost <i>Shakedown</i>. Jer broke out Tiger for this set, his main guitar 1979-90. <i>Samson</i> is some average, some ouch. Though not one of the best versions, when compared in context <i>So Many Roads</i> stands out. The OFF version is edited and patched [from 0:00&gt;0:11 is 3/27/95; 0:11&gt;3:36 is the SBD; 3:36&gt;3:52 is SBD's section 5:59&gt;6:16; @3:52 it jumps back to SBD's 3:51&gt;4:01; @4:01 it jumps to SBD's 6:25, cutting a flubby section, Jer accidentally repeating a verse, and the second solo]. <i>Samba</i> is actually okay, as far as that song goes, but surprising is the <i>Corrina</i>. The lengthy last-half jam is not only the best of the show but one of the most interesting of the tour. As it ebbs &amp; flows, all of Jer's work here is great, even if the song is nobody's fave. Check Bobby in the jam and listen for the final Phil jam with the drummers. A gold nugget lying in the mud, this indicates where the song was heading, or that it was finally coming together. As bad as some second sets are in '95, <i>Drums</i> was peaking, and this is a huge stadium, psychedelic version. The same is usually true for <i>Space</i>, but not tonight. <i>Unbroken Chain</i> may not be a true trainwreck, but Jer is mostly lost. The rest keep it together, though before '95 Phil was careful not to ask them to play it \u2013 not just because Phil had to sing but because of the difficult shifting signatures [the 11/8 section interspersed with 15/8]. There's no getting it all back by <i>Sugar Mag</i>, with Jer vacant and Bobby doing the wheezing thing. <i>Black Muddy</i> is a bit stumbly, but note that Jer, in his last vocal performance, changes the lyrics to \"Stones fall from my eyes instead of years\". In his audio book, about <i>Box of Rain</i>, Phil said \"I added this at the last minute because I just couldn't end the tour from hell with Black Muddy River. I called Box of Rain and we went through it. You can hear that it's sung with a little edge. I was having trouble keeping the tears back as I was singing; I really wanted to leave a ray of hope at the end of this tour.\" There are squelches @3:24/3:53/4:37. <b>Searching</b> drops volume to mask these, <b>30 Trips</b> cuts half a second from these. Double encores were common at the end of runs or tours before '92. Note that there were three Phil songs. A solid enough ending, actually, and it's a nice bit of history that the final show ended with a fireworks show and Hendrix. It's also sometimes forgotten that The Band opened.\t\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0D\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 1\u00be  stars\n \nHighlights:\nCorrina \u2013 unique jam\nDrums \u2013 peaking at the end of the bus ride\n\nSOURCES: The miller_114369 has the best sound, but has the tunings trimmed, which is particularly distracting in the 2nd set. <b>So Many Roads</b> has part of So Many Roads. The <b>Searching for the Sound</b> disc has Box of Rain, which was also included as a single in <b>30 Trips</b>. The first half of the 2nd set is usually up on YouTube [look for 1080p 60fps remaster] \u2013 mostly footage from the effects screen, but a good version of So Many Roads.",

Thank goodness for the Archive and Dick's Pick's!!!  This is a terrible show by musical (and/or Dead) standards.  All of the 5 star ratings are strictly emotional.  This being said from a 16 year old (at the time of the show) who was in pure bliss at any Dead show!\n\nFor anyone to gives this show 5 stars would be placing the final show among such shows as 5/8/77, 8/27/72, 02/14/68, 7/8/78, 02/18/71, 06/10/73, 04/29/71, 09/21/72, 02/09/73, 06/10/73, 02/24/74, 10/20/74, etc. (in no particular order)  you get the point.  I'm not trying to open a pandora's box of 'best shows' or 'best eras' (sorry for not including any 80's or 90's shows, I admittedly and biasly just like the 60's & 70's Dead better).\n\nLet's just face it people, this show sucked!!!\n\nProps to all of you posters who recognize that.  As a young head, by standards, trying to sift through 30 years of music to find the stuff dreams are made of, it's sad to see this show pop up as a 'show I need to hear.'   Sorry, but my Dead experience would be much better with out this this tape in my collection.\n\nBut wait, there is one moment, like in many shows...\n\nThis So Many Roads is by far the best of all 55 they played.\n\nI have not heard all of them, I admit, but have heard a lot of them.  It is epic, transcendent, creepy, beautiful, and poetic in its utmost form.  As cliche as it sounds, it's like Jerry is saying goodbye.  He's singing about all his years and the roads he's been down to find peace in this life, that we all share, just the same.\n\nNow Jerry is where billions have gone before him, and will all end up after him.\n\nThank you Jerry.  For being human and being willing to fail and succeed if front of thousands of people on a regular basis.  It makes us all know that life is not about perfection and bliss, just trying to get there as often as possible.",
