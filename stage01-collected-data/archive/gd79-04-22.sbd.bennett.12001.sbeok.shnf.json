Someone next to me mentioned that he had been in the Bob Weir Band and I suddenly remembered a BWB gig I had seen the previous year at the Old Waldorf in SF. Still couldn't remember his name. The local paper mentioned who he was in a review the next day.\nMost pass this show off as just average. I beg to differ. Just having some new keyboard sounds to relish after witnessing Keith's deminished input on piano made for pleasurable listening. The stadium was a nice venue, Charlie Daniels and Greg Kihn warmed up the crowd and it rained during Looks Like Rain. Cosmic!!\nLast but not least, this was a rather long show, packing in a boatload of tunes. We all got our money's worth on this afternoon.",

Very funny, the reviewer who states it sounds like this recording was made from the bottom of a swimming pool... He's quite accurate!\n\nWould someone please write me and let me know the difference between all of these 64 bit/VR??? sound options?! I have been listening to the majority of shows through the V??? option... is that wise?\n\n1st Set: Jerry takes the controls on a tight \"Jack.\" So far, Brent's barely in the mix, both musically/vocally... \"Tennessee\" is quite plucky. \"Mama\" is also strong; \"Mexicali\" feels like the 'hop-a-long' version, more country than usual. \"Sugaree\" gets the extended mid-set treatment that's quite nicely prepared. \"Minglewood\" is standard but the \"Brown\" is poignantly played. \"LLR\" fills out the power ballad slot nicely. \"Stagger\" is efficicent if sludgy...Jerry's got inflection with the lyrics, tho. \"Passenger's\" Loud & booming; where's the wall of sound when you need it?! Everyone is on '11' here. \"Deal\"'s a mover and shaker and closes the set nicely. Bobby's all boyishly smiling wishing everyone enjoy the sunshine. \n\n2nd Set: Let's keep the place rocking with an up-tempo \"Miracle,\" that easily slides into \"Bertha.\" The band's enjoying themselves, but Jerry appears as if he'd rather be singing something else. He eventually joins the enthusiasm. The band's so on during \"Good Lovin\" that it matters not that Brent is sometimes off key. An active but immemorable \"Scarlet follows. \"Fire\" has a long if not revelatory intro. Granted, both are still quite enjoyable, and better than average. As is a Jerry-led \"Estimated.\" It's certainly not his most subtle work, but his notes are akin to daggers ripping through flesh. Yes, I need a mellow moment, \"He's Gone.\" (It was precluded by a whistle-call?!) Well-versed if a slightly too busy outro featuring only Brent and the drummers. \"Drums/Space\" have quite a bit of propulsion which adds the excitement factor heading into \"TOO.\" Unfortunately this version simmers down the 'over the top' feel of the show. It's really just a decent version, nothing monumental. The same cannot be said for \"Wharf\" which is all Jerry on this virtuoso outro. \"Around\" is a rocker! \n\nWow. they're just in a mood to play, play, play tonight. \"US\" is standard, but \"Shakedown\" tho not exceptionally lengthy, is well-constructed and lovingly played.\n\nA solid show, tho there's not a moment given to even introduce this new integral member to the crowd. Ummmm..i would consider that to be a polite policy. Unfortunately, this band is better than that.",

I wonder what that guy was smoking because this is a well played show, certainly a very nice debut for Brent. It continues to amaze me how some heads just tear the poor guy to shreds. He added so much color to so many of the same old, tired songs. He also seemed to give Garcia a good kick in the ass as well, their rapport was very obvious from the beginning. Someone said Brents songs just hurt? Are they really THAT bad? I don't think they were, I rather enjoyed it when he got the chance to sing and they are far from as bad as some ppl want to believe. As for this show, it's well played, especially considering the two month layoff and all the stuff that went down and Brent having to learn SO many tunes in a very little span of time. God Bless you Brent, there's many ppl who loved your sound and miss you. :)",

The Wharf Rat is phenomenal and listen to Bob on Arnd&Arnd - Even US Blues is poppin, The 2nd encore of Shakedown had to be one of the very few times they did this and if anyone remembers this song was not really well recieved - people hated the idea of the Dead selling out to the disco craze but this is a good one with some cool echo.\n\nLOOK I AM NOT BRAINWASHED INTO HANDING OUT 5'S LIKE LOLLIPOPS AND NEVER GIVE SOMETHING A 2 JUST INDULGE THIS POSTING AND LISTEN UP TO SOME REALLY GREAT RIFS ON THIS.",

      "review_text": "Brent the mood killer I have mixed emotions regarding the change in the lineup, Ya things sounded strained in the 02/79,  Keith is clearly less visible for what ever reason, I would like to learn much more about the fallout, most literature is very politically correct and safe, on keith and donna's departure, mentioning they decided to part ways.  And Im sure Brent was a very nice and talented fellow, but this for me marks the downfall of the band, Brent and his playing represent all that was lousy and weak about the 80's, the synthee tacky sound, the band was far better off without.  And by the way his voice is just as akward as donna's maybe worse and his song's,,, well, they really really hurt. \nThe period between micky's departure and keiths arival in 71 was exciting, considering Pigpen was also away and limited, this was really a 4 piece band, lean and mean. the dead may well have used another slim period to regroup, rather than radically altering their sound and direction.  I wouldn't have wished him to die, but I sure am glad for the sound of Bruce and Vince.  \nworth checking out to hear, but not a keeper.\n\nresponse to Big Boy Pete above..........................................\n\nBig Boy Pete,  I can see you are a Brent fan, and ALL the power too you, enjoy the decade, I wish I could join you. Yes I do not listen to very much 80's material, I'd like too, I think there are some great new tunes, but I can't help but feel that Brent smoothers the sound that was authenticly Dead, and genericly blankets it. Sure it is agreed that the bands best days were behind them, Bobby's playing seems to be less full and rythmic, the 2 drums are confliciting at best, and Jerry's Voice suffered. \nBut When you consider how gracefully Keith fit into already Classic material in late 71, not replacing PigPen, but adding a subtle richness to the sound, How the two co-existed in Europe72, later adding a fifth player into the band, \"How many times can we recall a classic moment where the players blended together, eg 6/29/76 Peggy-0, to forge a singular magical unscripted moment....  well that just doesn't happen too often in teh Brent Era, Brent's style seems overly divorced from the rest of the gang and in many ways non compatible with the strings, better left for other bands with far less musical ambition, in need of a quick fix. \nVince's Tunes, eg,Way To Go Home - Samba In The Rain\"  are essential 90's material, non divisible from the body of work.  It sounds as if Jerry never had as much fun as when playing Keith's Sing Your Blues Away. In Brent tunes, it's easy to actually question, which band is actually playing, not obviously the unique comodity of the Grateful Dead.  \n If non of this makes any sense to your ears, well then I  envy you, because, (and I don't mean this in any hurtful  or condisending way ), I truly believe Ignorance is Bliss.",

As Jerry wished - more color from the keys - they got in spades.  A wonderful, wonderful period that needs to be enjoyed on its own terms and not be compared to a by gone era.

I just don't think this was a right move for the Grateful Dead.  It now sounds more synthy, more fabricated, they have added a sound and a dimension to the music that takes it away from some of the more seriousness that transpired in the 70's.  I say seriousness because music has a tendency to be more credible when it sounds like it's coming from authentic instruments and not cheap sounding $1000 keyboards that amatuers usually play.  I think this show is the beginning of a change of sound that slowly took the GD away from their best days.  \n\nPerhaps the new synthy keyboard is just symbolic and they started heading down that road anyway.  The musical deterioration did start in mid to late '78 and ventured into '79.  They were doing even more drugs, their music started getting more sloppy, and even more telling was that the songs were just not as good.  Not too many memorable songs came out from the dead > 1978.  Their best songs evolved in the early to mid 1970's.  So perhaps I'm placing to much blame on the the keyboard and not enough on the entire band.\n\nSound quality of this show is suspect.  It's somewhere between a 2 and a 3, and I choose a 2.",

Brent is somewhat a non-entity but his sound gets louder as the show goes longer. Jerry does lots of fine leads.\n\nI attended this show and it rained a little. It was showering ~ which is somewhat annoying, because you put your poncho on and it stops raining, then you have to remove the poncho or parboil when the sun comes out. Minute you get the poncho off, it starts raining again. Then you put the poncho on and it stops raining. This went on for quite a bit of the day. It gave you the feeling that you were standing on the planet Mercury ~ one side freezes while the other side roasts. However, the sun came out for good in the second set and it was balmy. The smell of the air was heavenly ~ kinda like line-dried laundry.\n\nGreg Kihn opened and was very good and Charlie Daniels came on and got everybody dancing with his \"Devil Went Down To Georgia.\" I recall only that this was a so-so show for the GD. Brent was not a factor. Phil's bass in this mix is muddy, but the rest of the instruments have good separation.\n\nIt rained during LL Rain and that got a reaction from the crowd which was actually fairly subdued. Perhaps it was too early in the day for some of us. I know at the time, I was going to bed at 4 a.m. and generally wasn't getting up until noon during the week. I think quite a few of the Dead Head crowd shared my hours. Since I had to get up at 8 a.m. that day and drive 50 miles to San Jose, I was probably a little fuzzy around the edges. \n\nI believe this was BGP's first venture at this venue and when I ran into Bill Graham at break I told him that it was a good show and he thanked me for coming. Then he asked me what I thought of the sound and I said that I thought Brent was kinda lost in the mix. During the second set Brent was definitely more prominent in the house mix and one could immediately determine that Brent was a good addition to the band.\n\nBGP held more shows at Spartan Stadium and I attended a great show in the summer which featured Jackson Browne with David Lindley, Jimmy Buffet and the Coral Reefer Band, and Warren Zevon. The sound was immaculate at that show, so it leads me to conclude that this show in April of 79 was a shakedown cruise. And, of course, Bill Graham always invited the Grateful Dead to inaugurate a new venue.\n\nMore important than the GD playing a hot show was the fact that this was a good venue for outdoor music and everybody had a good time. Once I woke up, it was mostly a very pleasant and enjoyable afternoon.",

Jerry talked about wanting to get a sound with more sustain and Keith's unwillingness to embrace electronic keyboards (and to stay awake) was a detriment. But don't get down on Keith; his sound was an important part of some of the greatest times of the band. Can we imagine the sound of Europe 72 without Keith's piano for example? And Donna was not as bad as many of you claim. Really, the only thing that Donna did that was a cause for rolling the eyes and scratching your head was her \"Tarzan-like\" yell in Playing in the Band and her spacey/quasi-orgasmic \"Whoa Ohhh, Ahhhohhh\" between Scarlet Begonias and Fire on the Mountain. Otherwise, her harmonies added a lot. Cassidy? Looks Like Rain? Friend of the Devil? Passenger? They Love Each Other? Donna's harmonies added a lot to these tunes.\n\nThat said, Brent rocks. His Hammond B3 and vocals are cut from the Greg Allman school of playing. I can't help but think Pig Pen would have dug Brent's gritty, heartfelt, soulful playing and singing. He put it out there every night during a period when Garcia \"mailed it in\" on an unpredictable basis and Weir was , well, I'm not sure about Weir. From 70-74, Weir developed into a quite capable 2nd guitar. But in the post-hiatus and Brent-era sound, he went for a really thin, screechy tone and thought he could play a slide. The capable depth and warmth of his rhythm playing from 70-74 was gone. But I digress.... Brent was a consistent anchor in the sound who saved many a show during his time in the band.\n\nCompare this show to 2/17/79, Keith and Donna's last show. There is so much more energy, drive, and snap; the rest of the band sounds rejuvenated. Compare some of the common tunes between the two: Passenger, Miracle>Bertha>Good Lovin' where the band clearly is driving it a lot harder and just sounds more engaged in what they're doing.\n\nNo, this is not a \"perfect\" show and there are moments where it sounds like they still need awhile to gel with Brent and the new dynamic of the sound. 4 stars for \"very good.\"",

Could you imagine Stranger without Brent? The only song in my estimation that didn't flow as well (here I go comparing eras) is Estimated. It was smooth and became choppy with Brent. Never had the same warm flow. Then again the Dead never came close to the dirty high powered rock n roll that was Hard to Handle with Pig. This is a 4 star show. I actually really like some of the early Brent funk effects (should have used more) that he'd use on Shakedown and others. You can hear it during Scarlet into Fire but he's low in the mix.

And I've followed the light since then to now and all I can say that in the 36 years I followed the band -- even when I got backstage passes for their Cal Expo run in '92 -- is that it all began here and it's been awesome for the 36 years until the day Jerry passed, and then some.\n\nThis was one fucking outstanding show.",

I do remember it raining most of the day...and Bobby magically making it rain on command during LLR.\nListening now, this show is kickass. They are pretty tight here. Must be from all the rehearsing they did to get Brent up to speed. The set list is one of my favorites, just missing Terrapin and Franklins.",

It\u2019s soooo good. Every track is brilliant. Very nice energy all throughout. Brent seems to really have hit the ground running in very fine form. Curious that they played no space this evening. Instead drums is quite long and very exciting. ",
