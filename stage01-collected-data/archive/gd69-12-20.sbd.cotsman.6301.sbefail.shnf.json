They both purport to be the first acoustic show, because of Bill being late. Im very interested in the band's transistion from the machine-eating psychedlic monster of the late 60's to the sweet/sad acoustic combo of the early 70's. Any ideas? For instance, was Bill actually late to both shows, leading to the same type of acoustic set as a result? And was it actually only serendipidy that led to the acoustic stuff. Naturally it became a mjor part of the trip during 1970 (with the NRPS shows). Also, has anyone else notoced how often NSB is described as a reaction to Kent State? The timeline seems to blow that analysis away...\nAt any rate, this is WONDERFUL music. Do yourself a favor and git it, right this very second.",

      "review_text": "Lost & Found Drawer <br />With the official release, this show went from half lost to mostly found. The set list is as noted above (plus the Lovelight finish), and all now circulate except the Black Peter and the complete Eleven. <b>DaP6</b> added the complete Mason's, Me & My Uncle, Hard to Handle, Cumberland, Dark Star, St. Stephen, and the complete Lovelight (the official is out of order, to save space; the liner notes are by TC). The SBD was redlined, so there's not a lot of dynamics. This was the middle of a 3-show run, the final run at the original Fillmore (under new management and now marketed as \"The New Old Fillmore\"). There were several opening bands, so it's just a 45min first set, and a 90min second. Ultimately it's not quite as good as the next night, and not as interesting as the night before, except for the historical angle of having the first Speedway.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Mason's</i> is just the 2nd one, and still improving. <i>China Cat>Rider</i>, which is solid, was played seven shows in a row at this time - standard in '69, I know. Being a workhorse band is how they got so damned good in the '70s. After a decent <i>M&MU</i> there's a lyrics bungle in <i>High Time</i>, <i>Hard to Handle</i> isn't one of the great, lively versions, and <i>Cumberland</i> is average, if lackluster. Set closer <i>Black Peter</i> DNC or is lost.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Dark Star</i> is quickly ethereal. After 9mins it gets interesting. There's a Sputnik jam @10:30,  and Phil starts a Feelin' Groovy jam @12:35. But it doesn't take until Bobby joins half a minute later, then struggles while dissolving for a minute. The descent back to the main theme after 17min is delicious. More than a must-hear-once, because it gets better a couple times through. <i>Saint Stephen</i> is just smooth enough to be noted, ticking all the boxes. The first 15 secs or so of <i>The Eleven</i> are lost to a reel flip. The first 35sec on the official are from 12/11, wed to 0: 46 on the SBD (thus missing those 46secs). Ah well, it's the last 2 minutes that are interesting. This is the first <i>New Speedway Boogie</i>, and note that it's only two weeks since the event (Altamont) happened. That's fast service!  But then, this is the earliest arrangement, they had just learned it, and it's MHO only for those interested in that historical genesis. Maybe they were going to premiere it the night before, but didn't when Phil was late. Either way it's back to the woodshed for this one. For <i>Lovelight</i> you had to be there. It's very masturbatory, with little actual playing, and Pig's rap would make national social media problems today - I'm not sure most thought it was OK even then.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 2\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nSaint Stephen - enough to be noted [and probably the lead-in Dark Star]\n\nSOURCES: This source plus <b>Dave's 6</b> (which has all but Black Peter and a complete Eleven).",

The Eleven, however, is one of those songs that I can listen to anytime anywhere any quality.    \n\nThe only reasons I can see listening to this are:\n1. It's December 20 and you want to listen to a show from that day, no matter the quality.\n2. You want to hear the first time they played NSB\n3. You want to understand how awful a song can sound when the band first plays it (NSB), knowing what an awesome song it eventually becomes within just a few months.  \n\nOther than that, find the road to something else.  Or don't leave the page, and listen to this like thousands of other people did and enjoy the time. \n\n\nThis is not more than 2 stars ",
