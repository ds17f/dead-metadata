A super funky show that brings the dance machine straight to your brain and doesnt let up.  Lesh slides all over the fretless, Jerry wails, and the second set throws down bigtime.  Perhaps the show that converted me to the Dead after Pigpen.  Enjoy.",

Sometimes a small portion, a song, even an split second inside 3 hours of playing drives you  and is worth the experience, Phils bass line in the second Roll Away the Dew in the First Corus of Franklin's Tower does that for me, a little John Kahn influenced maybe.  Also Keith's post spring77 style of playing is special in its own right, \n  five stars for unique qualities, not worth missing.\nI admit I could be more critical, and realize I tend to only review my 5star shows, after all, they are the ones worth getting excited about.",

Jack Straw is very strong, and Let it Grow is a first set stunner. Jerry gets super fat 'n funky in Dancin to start the second, with Eyes and NFA the highlights of a quality set.  No letdown throughout... good sound... don't overlook this show.",

No matter how great those shows, they all have at least a couple songs where the gang is simply going through the motions (eg, almost the entire first set of Cornell). There isn't a single song this night that doesn't have something very special about it.\n\n...___[:]o",

My favorite part of the set is the part of the show that was never officially released: Estimated>Eyes is one of the best parings of those tunes of the year, with the Estimated being particularly groovy.",

During slip knot the whole bands watching Jerry as he shakes his head no then when he finally says yes and they hit the final progression to go into Franklins Tower I seriously melted!! This show was awesome in spite of the crowd that would not get up and dance. Being my first show I was unaware that you get up and dance at a Dead concert.
