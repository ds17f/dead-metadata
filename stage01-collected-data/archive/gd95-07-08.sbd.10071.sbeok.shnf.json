First off the sound quality of this show is great, the band's performance average.  Good and solid Jack Straw opener had this reviewers hopes up.  Next came a 11 minute Sugaree and it had the lyrical mistakes not uncommon in '95.  Wang Dang was good and the rest of the set good.  Second set was the same as the first.  China>Rider was average, All Too Much was good and I enjoyed Vince on this one.  Saint is Saint and a solid version.  This is where the show kinda came apart for me.  I was hoping and praying that Jerry would remember the lyrics to one of the Dead's classics Terrapin Station....It was rough and the \"Inspiration\" came over weak.  Drumz was tight and the Billy and Mickey did what they do best!  A short but lively The Other One followed and now it was time for the Jerry Ballad.  What would it be?  Sounded like Wharf Rat but no!  Visions of Johanna came creeping out of The Other One.  Thanks to the Tele-Prompters Jerry nailed it....I still get goose bumps when he sings about Mona Lisa and her highway blues and pumped his fist in the air...As if to say \"it's alright children, I am here now.\"  Great song and worth the download alone.  Saturday Night followed and now it was time for the encore.  I like many other people I know now call this the U.S. Blues jam as Jerry forgot about all the words.  If you were there and want look back then get this show.  Thank you Jerry and the Grateful Dead.",

China>Rider being on the other hand relativly short and unadventurous. Has it's ups and downs - Garcia flubs some lyrics and misses a few guitar cues, but I found it to be a surprisingly coherent show for such a late date. Sound quailty is very good throughout with no major hick-ups to report, though 'Eternity' is patched from an AUD source.",

The band does ramp up from time to time, but it's obvious that it's not going to explode.  Visions of Johana is so beautiful and poignant for me that it's hard to describe.  If nothing else listen to this song (I think it's on the fallout from the phil zone Cds from GDP).\n     Overall sound quality is decent, with the balance being better than many from this era.

Why put yourself through the diappointment? I'm not an old head from the 60's ruminating over the days at the Filmore.

This show is HORRIBLE, its an embarassment to anyone who likes dead music. 95 was the worst year ever for the boys; the only competent shows I've heard are the Salt Lake shows, and 5-26 in Seattle, the rest have been crap. The scene was shit at these shows as well; I went to every Soldier Field show since 92 and I never saw half the drunk people getting carried off on strechers before this. This show was so bad that I skipped the next night even though I was living only 2 hours away at the time. After hearing the next night I'm not dissapionted; even if it was the last dead show ever. Oh yeah, while I'm complaining, why does everybody bitch about Vince so much, to me Brent sucks just as bad. Tons of Steel c'mon, thats the cheesiest dead song ever. Maybe if some of these people would listen to some good 90s dead they could actually make an informed judgement on how bad the 90s sucked. I saw shows in the 90s that in my opinion were just as good as anything they played w/ Brent. I know that I'm in the minority here though so I'll shut up. If you want to here a good 90s show, check out 6-25-92; this is what Chi-Town Dead should sound like. Strangely enough, the Visions at the show is one of the most poignant moments I ever witnessed at a dead show. It was like Jerry saying goodbye to us. It actually brings a tear to my eye; Goodbye Jer, we love you. Goes to show you don't ever know!",

Man...back in 95 when I was getting these shows as they came out during tour, for some reason I thought they were OK (any Dead show is a good show! Right???)...but as I listen to almost any 95 show now, I have found myself following in the footsteps of what many others were sayin back then...this is sad.",

It's disgusting to hear people actually make some of the comments that they have made here. Listen to someone else if you can't appreciate the good vibes and great music that the Dead have been playing for all the years. Nothing but admiration and appreciation here. I only wish that Jerry was still here and that the Dead were still playing great music, having fun, and taking us along for the ride.",

The guy next to me was going crazy during visions, and i had to inform him that jerry was reading the words from sheet music taped on his mic stand. he didn't want to believe me and said jerry was singing from his heart and he would NEVER forget the poignant words...  funny, sorry i burst his bubble. although that is a long song, even by dylan standards.\nthanks for the china>rider>st of c>terrapin\nSoldier field is a cool venue, too.\nI'll download this for prosperity sake,\nthanks boys",

Visions beautiful, U.S. Blues breathtaking (Jerry was teary eyed the whole song!) I only wish I didn't sell my ticket for Sunday! I will never forgive myself for that. However the 2 St. Louis shows before this were great times (RIP Ped, I'll never forget our GD journeys or the rainbow gathering before the St. Louis shows).\nPlease before judging these shows realize their place in time! While they were not the shows of the 70's they still held there place for us youngsters in the late 90's! THANKS Grateful Dead!",

It seemed to be a struggle to get the lyrics out, again, for him, and he knew it.  Oh well.  He wasn't the one partying on that stage, just the one getting all the blame for the Bob Weir/Vince welnik trainwreck that thier chees was heading the scene into.  It was getting sold out and I probably would have used if I had to deal with what Jerry dealt with post Brent. IMO.  Gnarly version of awnrey Jerry playing a scratchy other one, the only one of the tour.  What else can you say about the hauntingly beautiful version of Visions.  Jerry  at his vocal best, ever!",

      "review_text": "Snydel's review is DEAD wrong My 1st show was 1978 at the Capitol Theatre and last show was in June 1995 at Giants Stadium. I've seen well over 200 shows and feel I'm more than qualified to give an give my opinon of the review below mine.IMO 1965 to the early 83 were incredible years filled with lots of magic. 84 to mid 86 had great moments but the drugs use that lead to the coma were fucking Jerry up big time (obviously). The end of 86 with the big comeback concert - mainstream success and the start of the MEGA DEAD period were just crackling with energy. This continued right up till the time of Built to Last but the band took a HUGE HIT with Brents death. 91 and 93 saw a whole different dynamic with Bruce and Vince. Again I was totally diggin the whole thing but the scene had been changing alot and it was'nt always kind. No doubt that by 94 it was clear that Jerry's health was a HUGE FUCKEN PROBLEM but I'll tell you, I remember saying Jerry looked old or tired or whateverbut I never complained. I never minded the flubs being I understood what was happening. I loved the band, by 1994 it was a big part of my life for 16 years. Jesus Christ by that point in time it was a family member to me and still is.I saw many a show in 95 - knew the end was near and CHERISHED IT. The magic was still there - think about it, a man with less than 2 months to live brought tears to your eyes with beautiful - soulful renditions on Visions of Joanna on 7-8-95 and with So Many Roads on 7-9-95 (last show).LESS THAN 2 MONTHS TO LIVE and he did that. So in closing my advice to new listeners is take it all in 65 to 95 - hell take it FURTHUR. The magic is and has always been there. Snydel your entitled to your opinion I just respectfully disagree. See you all at Radio City and Trump in A/C . see what I saying- BOUND TO COVER JUST A LITTLE MORE GROUND !!!!",

      "review_text": "Not the best. First off, let me say that there are definitely some great moments here, albeit few and far between.  Jack Straw is quite good, as is Sugaree.  China Cat is bouncy and fun and Terrapin is even good once the band starts jamming on it.  Drums and Space are both very decent and the latter really seems to go places.  \n\nThe rest of the show however is pretty bad.  It's All Too Much and Eternity are remarkably bad. The Other One is completely castrated and Visions of Johanna through the end of the show I was simply unable to listen to any of these songs all the way through.  \n\nGlad this wasn't the first Dead show I ever heard.",

This show kicked ass.  Not all the time,  but when Jerry belted out \"you can tell by the way she smiled\" It went thru my soul and I have not figured out where my soul is.
