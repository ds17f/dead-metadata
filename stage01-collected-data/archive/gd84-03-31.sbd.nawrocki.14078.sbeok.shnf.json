Minglewood - I'm always hesitant to call any song the \"best\" version because a lot of that subjective rating depends on my mood, so I usally call a song in a show a \"top 5\" or \"top 10.\" This, however, is undoubtedly the best I've heard.\n2.) He's Gone - trippy ending that left me with chills down my spine.\n3.) Scarlet>Fire, especially the Fire\n\nOf course, there are its downsides, like Jerry's voice, which stratocaster once described in a post about 1984 as \"fozzee the bear pudding throat.\"\n\nOverall a very creative show. It felt as if they were really channeling something cosmic. It may not be a top 10 for the year, and it's not even a 5 star show. It does prove, however, that there was a lot of good stuff in 1984 and it set the stage for a very nice 4/1/84 show at the same location.",

Thetaer, as well as Marin Civic?  I'd love to hear a comparison.  I saw the Greek '86 shows but never made it to the BCT.  Touch came soon and they could not play the sweet small places after that.\n\nThis is one of my all-time Scarlet > Fires and I have many in my nearly 2000 hrs. of live Dead.  They did many early that year - this one, Hampton 4/13, Philly 4/20 (I agree with SUNPYG - and I love Zappa - this is a monster version), Providence 4/26.  That said I totally agree with BigBoyPeete, I get tired of seeing reviews just base don a year also. \"Well it's 84, so blah blah blah....\"  And half thos epeople never even saw the Dead at all, let alone in that year.  They're just going by tapes and/or what someone else said.  This was a real solid year overall, I saw about 14 shows that year, and was a great lead-in to the phenomenal year that was '85 for the 20th anniversary.  As for '84, aside form the spring shpws I mentioned earlier, get this whole run, Eugene, Red Rocks, Merriweather, Greeks, Richmond, Alpine, Syracuse for a killer Shakedown, ditto New year's, that is an all-time Shakedown.

But I listened the whole show through, and I'm sorry but I just have to disagree with the majority. Unfortunately, the band's performance is great, just marred by sound production issues. I really just have to place the blame for this musical failure solely on Brent Mydland and Dan Healy, or whoever approved of these guys.\n\nBrent, you should Never have taken anything except a regular old grand piano. Or if you did, you should have made it sound like one.\n\nDan Healy, you should have stayed the hell away from any mixers or audio effects boards. Maybe you can adjust things a little, but do not mess with the effects while the boys are playing!\n\nFor a great example of the mess these two guys can make together, try listening to the Dupree's here (cringe-worthy abuse of the band's sound). It makes the band sound like a creepy carnival organ.  Or, especially, the tragic end of Scarlet-Fire. Jerry pulls out some amazing riffs, Phil is bouncing all over the place and Bobby's guitar is screeching in time, but then WTF? Dan Healy abruptly cranks up a huge reverb effect on Jerry. Ok...this could sound good..if they had not made it so abrupt--then WTF? about a minute later, it's completely switched off just as abruptly! \n\nNeedless to say, this kind of sound abuse really kills the rockin' mood.\n\nAnyway if you can tolerate the fake sound effects and still enjoy the performance, get this, otherwise keep your ears behind the april 1979 line in the sand.",

Or if you did, you should have made it sound like one.\n\nDan Healy, you should have stayed the hell away from any mixers or audio effects boards. Maybe you can adjust things a little, but do not mess with the effects while the boys are playing!\nend quote\n\nyou are a moron ....first off Brent played Hammond and some type of Moog-ish stuff in this time period....they wanted to change their sound when they got Brent...they weren't looking for a copy of Keith \n\nand secondly ...when you hear a board you ARE NOT hearing a \"mix\" the recording actually comes before most of the adjustments ...if you want to hear what this show actually sounded like ...listen to an AUD. source \n\nI'm sure if Brent were alive he would most interested in your opinion of his equipment choices .\n\nand its a shame The Dead didn't have your application ...perhaps you could have stolen Healy's job ....apparently you are more skilled in the ways of sound management than their crew \n\nIt's always nice to meet a true DeadHead",

The Scarlet is good, the transition jam is funky and interesting, but it's the FIRE that really grabs you. Brent is just all over the first third, rippling and punching and filling with all kinds of calypso-themed riffs, just infusing this version with island rhythms....then Jerry breaks into the fore after the 2nd verse and rages this sucker right into a picture-perfect return coda. It's gold, and falls into my top 3 FIREs of all time.\n\nOverall, this show has a very groovy feel...it's less speeded-out than a lot of its early-80's bretheren (e.g. check out the behind-the-backbeat groove on \"Women R Smarter\")...Brent and Bobby goof around with the cadence and tempo and it's clear they're having a blast.\n\nAlso, Garcia's vocals in this show, while '84 raw to be sure, actually hold together, and the effect is more Tom Waits-ish than the sad frog-in-a-blender pinchiness that accompanies most every post-'83 performance. he shines especially on the aforementioned FIRE and ALABAMA and again on an inspired HE'S GONE.\n\nThe SPACE is \"Allah\"-tinged which makes it more interesting than most and they finish up w/a fine T-STONES/NFA combo.\n\nThis is very close to a 5-star show (a bit of sloppiness in some of the first set prevents me from going the full 5) but the sound quality of the board is A-1 and pretty to hear.\n\nyou can't go wrong. I call this one a hidden gem despite the fair # of reviews here...I just never had it on my radar....now it's very much in the rotation.",

      "review_text": "A little overhyped but enjoyable Marin County Veteran's Aud is a gem of a place to see the Dead if you like venues that are shaped like a spaceship and hold less than 2,000 Northern California freaks.  Personally, that's my kind of venue. Saw JGB there in 1987 and it was terrific. \n\nThis show starts out pretty energetically and the sound is pristine, although Jerry tends to be a little further back in the mix than I like.  With all due respect to those that are ready to canonize this show, I am not in agreement. It is a pretty average show for the period. I am not knocking it, their average is great but it is still average. I have always liked the term \"workman\" to describe a night where they showed up, played their hearts out but for whatever reason, it was just a routine night of playing music. This is a smidge better than that but not by a lot.  \n\nI'll give it four stars because it is worth a listen but it's not making my list of favorite shows. To those that love it - rock on! That's why there's chocolate and vanilla ice cream. ",
