Very high energy with solid first set and post drums. This was one of my best sounding tapes back in those ancient times, even better as a SHN.

Just the parking lot of the shopping mall was like a show itself!  Must've been almost a thousand people there.  Blow away was hotter than almost anything.  First set, made the tempo of the show as a whole, and after Blow Away, and Loose Lucy, you knew the 2nd was going to rock!  Again, West Trenton Crew made it there for that. This is the best show I ever saw, and unfortunately, last one with Brett, and he rocked that day, and didn't look unhappy at all. Wheel still sends shivers up my back, and tears down my cheeks, cause the beauty of that show was unreplaceable, and beyond words... Simply passionate energy.  Jerry and Brett ruled that show, and Phil was in a good mood too.  All so tight.  Do enjoy!",

Magic....Csn played a great set with Brent looking on in the wings...I can remember it all like it happened tonight...Csn, then Grateful Dead....WOW!~ even thoough I do not care for the Buffalo bills...Rich Staduim will always hold a very special place in my heart..seeing as the two greatest days of my life were spent outside and inside this stadium....also my last Brent show......I'll never know what may have happened if he had lived longer...but maybe, just maybe, Jerry would of held on longer. it has always been my feeling that when Brent Died...he took Jerry with him....anyways...thank you both for the memories...and archive you ROCK!!",

A bunch of us tried to coax Jerry into jumping on the pedal steel that some other tool was playing at the time. He just laughed and gave us a nod.

Went from Syracuse late morning with my sister's old boyfriend and a couple of his friends. 16 years old and really never been out of the suburbs and with the freaks on such a large scale. Took 6 hits, lost my ride, and instead of freaking out just enjoyed the day. As a solo flyer made my way all the way to the front during set 1 then all the way at the top for the start of set 2. You guessed it, back in the front row for post space. Crazy. Never in my life have I experienced such an event and it changed my life forever and opened up so many worlds. Remember beautiful weather, Crosby on stage during Half step, the crazy energy through that start of the second set ( Nobody seems to mention that crazy midi on Women!), the pulsing through my body of Brent's keys and Jer's guitar flurry on Gimme' some lovin'. All too much. Of course until my next show 9/20/90. Then I became the 'responsible' one guiding my friend through his first show. THANK YOU to that sweet women and two guys that gave me a wonderful ride home out of there way. Never saw a more glorius sunrise than thatmorning, the sky was all pink and orange. Had to sit on bench on a nature path in my development and let it soak in for awhile. Hell, 29 shows and 15 years later it still is. So Many Roads indeed. Bless you boys.",

The high time is real pretty; Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s voice is just in the right place on this night. If the rest of the band had been able to keep up with brent on the let it grow something truly special could have happened. All the same, despite some timing issues and miscues the let it grow still rocks out pretty hard, just not tightly.\n\nThe sugar mags is a nice opener but the segue into scarlet is what makes this band timeless. A short sugar is one thing but a short scarlet, and then > man smart. Who knows? As a fan of ship of fools only out of context I usually snooze button this tune while listening to a show, and I don\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t think this is a particularly lively version but the placement after an odd-ball beginning to the set is good. They opened with the set with 3 set openers back to back to back, skipped two regular song progressions and jammed out the least likely choice. Ship of Fools just fits here. The first notes of truckin are nice to hear, by 15 seconds it seems like nothing else would have fit right here. Guess the theme? The song selection in this set is awesome!

      "review_text": "Dosin  up to Buffalo Buffalo holds a very near and dear place for me (in regards to Dead Shows).  Between 85 and 93 I saw 106 shows and though this was not the best of em (very close though), it was the most fun.  One of my best friends yards bordered the camping (right by the 7/11).   His parents always went away for the weekend of the Dead.  Our other buddy's Dad owns the Miller distributorship in Buffalo so we had kegs of beer, a pig on a spit and probaly the largest illegal drug market not 20 feet from the yard.  So nice when touring to have a stop where you can clean up, sleep well and re-charge.  Another bonus is their friends worked security (all heads too) and they had a bag of goodies for us when we went in (some of us heads didn't hide our stash very well and they had to confiscate stuff that was flagrant).   \n\nWe've got a really big show for you here though.  Long and fun first set.  Highlights abound.  Very solid throughout with the 1/2 Step (Phil is all over it like white on rice and it is the only one of the summer), High Time and Let It Grow finishing Win, Place and Show to me.  Blow Away just finishes outside of the money, though not by much. The whole field was game though.\n\nSecond Set starts with a short but hot Sugar Mag into, what's this??  Scarlet.  Whoooaaaa!!!! Nice, but short too into a fun Women Smarter (it was alot of fun).  Ship of Fools gets slows down the pace just a bit and explores the innerworld the way Jerry's tunes always doo.  It is a very good Ship.  Truckin' is way above average (the Buffalo line shakes the house) with a great Jam after it.  The Jam definetely has an TOO feel to it and it is hot.  \n\nDrums is really good, with manic voices being heard everywhere.  They come back into a sweet little Jam that leads us into a beautiful and tasty Wheel is not to be missed.  Brent and Phil lead the way into a Gimme Some Lovin that is just alot of fun.   Wharf Rat is very soulful, but isn't the homerun that it can be.   Around and Around is upbeat and always a solid choice, just not stellar but it does lead us into a fun Sunshine Daydream that gives us closure to one of the better (IMHO best) summer shows of 1990.\n\nBrokedown, what can you say about it.  It's my favorite encore and one of my favorite Dead tunes.  Just so sweet and earnest, and this one is no exception.\n\nOver all this is a 5 star example of why summer of 1990 was special muscially.  \n\nFare Thee Well I love you more than words can tell",

I think I was in that guys back yard by the stadium - had to be - we'll we are getting ready to hunker down for the night blankets out and the whole nine yards ready to crawl in when the rains came, the sky opened up around midnight and we made our getaway.

I believe we were all trying to give the guys our soaring emotions for showing us such a high time.\n\nWarmeed up by Bobby's Bucket, everything was kikkin' in nice when Jerry let loose his warning that he was feeling good with the latter half of Halfstep. We were literally Blown Away by Brent ( What a Rendition!!!)\n\nMame Tried and Mexicali Seemed almost perfect tunes, for The Perfect day... I still remember the Jaw-dropping amazed feeling we all shared as the first notes of Lucy sprang forth... Who was telling who? was Jerry Thanking us or were we all thanking Him for the REAL GOOD TIME???\nWE all shouted and screamed  for and with Bob that it was All Over Now. And Jerry Calmed us with another jaw dropping surprize.... and we ALL knew WE were Living The Good life that day!!!\n\n\nDownload this cause  There's Nothing Like A Dead Show!!!!!

Great scene - at least as far as I recall - outside the show.\n\nFirst set:\nBucket - I am of the opinion that this song was great when it was looser and more jammed out in '83 - '85. Good version - but wished Bob had chosen another.\nHalf-step - just fantastic. Jerry - little did we know - was having (one of) the best years of his post-coma crash. He delivers and then some on this.\n\nBlow Away - always liked Brent. Never cared for his lead songs...but this was very well done.\n\nBob's cowboy songs - Cumberland>River would have been better.\n\nLoose Lucy - Again, Garcia just digging into it. Real Good time, indeed.\n\nLet it Grow - Bob delivers here - probaby his strongest song of the set.\n\nSet 2:\nWhen the boys were tuning - I turned to my friend and said: \" I here Sugar Magnolia - but that can't be...\" It was and we loved it. Very cool - I agree with everyone...the transition into Scarlet may be one of the more seemless threads the band has ever sowed.\n\nHere is where I think the show COULD have been a top 20 all time (ok, maybe top 30). Bag Women are Smarter for either Fire or Eyes, or JAM here. Who knows what would have happened. Love the Women - but not at this point in the show. Oh, well.\n\nShip - many find this a downer. I am more of a Comes a Time fan. But still found Jerry (once again) on top and he opens the door for one of the best Truckin's in 5 years. Jam is beyond description.\n\nPost Space is really great. Esp Wheel,and the SSDD Sandwhich ending.\n\nReally - no complaints. Last time for me. And it was a great way to go . Thanks to the Band and the Good Lord for keeping Jer around an extra 9 years.",
