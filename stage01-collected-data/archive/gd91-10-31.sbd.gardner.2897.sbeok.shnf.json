First set   \nwas awesome. I was very close to the stage- on Phil side in the stands at the Coliseum.\nWords cannot describe what an experience this show was. The parking lot scene was outta control with the freaky costumes. Near impossible to score a ticket if you didn't already have one.\nOf all my shows I have the fondest memories of this one. I can still see the opening set and the band on stage in my mind.\nTragic as Bill's death was, I believe his death really brought out what the Dead were really all about. The first show of this run was sweet too. Very unexpected surprise to see Santana come out and jam on Iko.",

The mood in the building that night was VERY different...everyone knew it was the end of era with Bill's passing.  After the show I pulled into a gas station and standing there at the next pump was Kesey.  I said \"unbelievable rap there Kesey\" and he was soo high he just looked at me with his pupils the size of pie-plates and this quivering smile on his face.  He was blazing.\n\nDownload this show, turn down the lights and turn up the volume.",

My impression has always been that this was Kesey's eulogy to BG.  He does get quite emotional about his old freind, especially when he recounts BG reaching out to Kesey when he lost his son.\n\nHave a close listen.  When I heard this I remembered the only New Year's show I have been to when one of my best freinds ran into Kesey and another ran into BG.  This memory suddenly became very serendipitous to me.  I remember being brought to tears by this.  Kesey is so damned grand-eloquent.\n\nAlso, it is not a single guitar but the entire band jamming low behind him.\n\nKesey remarks, \"This is what this shit is all about!\"  Yes it is, indeed.",

The music is simply glorious.  It almost brought tears to my eyes.  Each song or group of songs is like an epic symphonic production.  The overall sound of the band is HUGE, but you can still hear each instrument separately. The first set contains some OLD songs, but they are given a fantastic treatment.  Jerry's scratchy voice gives them a world-weary touch.  \"Loser\" sounds like advice from someone who has really been through the mill. Help>Franklin and Scarlet>Fire are wonderful. Bob's Rooster and Grow are equally good. A very nice surprise appearance from Phil on Tom Thumb.  The second set including the long Dark Star/Space segment is very appropriate for Halloween night - some weird and scary stuff inside!

I can not do justice as so many have written about this show. \nWhat I can remember distictly is that during Scarlet>Fire I was on the floor and it was really hot (I was influenced my magic as well) and at one point the costumes were all too much and then I heard the sound of Jerry's first few licks of the Scarlet intro and things were soooo weird; if the person who was the witch with the broom stick and mask please identify yourself!-and remove your image from my cerebral cortex...seriously weird..I was not in costume. So unfortunate about BG but such great music here. The HSFranks in set one is not shab job either...slipknot will shred you a new a-hole! Crank it up! Someone was a big Chubaka and was dancing his ass off! I was like, 'okay, big ass chubaka is into the slipknot...make note to self...'chubaka dances like the hulk on acid. Great! Oh and he is dancing closer and closer to me...how cool!....that was the weird thing about this show; the costumes were so odd to be around.\nThe dark star is over the top pure jazzified psychidelic dead. The licks are sparse yet plentyful and, as Kesey once said about Garcia's licks, 'they slithered like snakes in and out of loosely stacked chords\". \n\nThe 'let it grow' in set one also deserves mention as does the werewolves encore. This whole show is kind quality and better than the other one also posted here. \n\nWhat a great memory...then those days in the park on 11/3 were such a blast...",

When he was done he up it back in and sent me on my way a different person.\n      as for the rest of the show. it gave me the typical holy shit feeling. like a freight train just ran me over, The second set had my brain cooking. I started coming down during not fade away. or so i thought. when werewolves started, jerry's vocals were the only thing keeping me on the ground. the sounds of the guitar licks were coming through in rays.\n\nif you're a deadhead and havent listened to this show well then.

The sadness and shock of Bill Graham's death was written on their faces.  At times that grief was channeled into a kind of dark intensity; at other times they seemed to be sleepwalking through the set.  Kesey's poem was terrifying in its intensity.  But the most powerful moment for me was the first notes of \"Fire on the Mountain\".  Given that Graham's helecopter crashed and burned on the side of a Sonoma hill, the song was disturbing.  But more disturbing was being close enough to the stage to see Jerry crying while he was singing the song.  It saddens me just writing this.",

It was more than just harmony; more like suggestive highlights.\n\nPlease, if anyone can suggest a better show from the 91 tour, let me know.

What others aren't reporting however is that this was also the week of the terrible fires in the Oakland Hills that had killed something like 23 people, including the kid brother of a woman I worked with, a young cop trying to get people out. So as we made our way through the crowd there at the front of the Coliseum all the flags were at half staff and for a moment, it was unclear what tragedy was being recognized. In the same vein, Fire on the Mountain clearly went both ways as well. But it was of course Kesey, appearing out of nowhere in top hat and tails, that forever burnt the show in the minds of all who were there. We were on the seats, but close and maybe a third of the way up on the \"Jerry side,\" from which Kesey spoke, close enough that I got a decent whiplash as he spat \"Mr. Death!\"  But it was trauma that all but dissolved in Phil's amazing contribution to the Drums etc. that followed.
