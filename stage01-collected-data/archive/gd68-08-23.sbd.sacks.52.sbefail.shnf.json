Look at the set list, and yeah, this is the kind of 1968 freak out you could dream of (Gator's mystical percussion and Jer's tender solo)  These are our holy relics.

      "review_text": "8/29/68 The filler to this show, labeled August 29th, 1968, is clearly mis-dated. The Saint Stephen (or what's left of it) is the most obvious clue to the mystery date. One the 8/23 show, St. Stephen has the William Tell bridge segueing into the Eleven. On \"8/29,\" the Stephen has the \"Can you answer/Yes I can/But what would be the answer to the answer man?\" line, then a jam on the theme behind those lyrics, segueing into Cryptical. The funny thing is, the 6/14/68 Stephen had a very similar end jam attached to it, dating this St. Stephen (and the rest of the show) several months earlier than 8/29. \n\nIn fact, it may be possible that this show occured    before 6/14. It's also especially unlikely that this show could have been recorded at a tiny club such as the Matrix, since the SBD suggests a far bigger venue. My best guess would be one of the Carousel Ballroom shows 5/30-6/1/68 or 6/7-6/9/68 or maybe even Shrine Exhibition Hall 5/17/68.",

Cryptic and Other One ebb and flow with energy providing alternating relief and excitement. And a beautiful Jerry lead in to Dark Star with that nice medium tempo and aside from a few vocal lines in the middle, all Jerry with great support from the band. Solid vocals on St. Steph, real tight. Eleven, again well balanced high energy and relief, mostly HIGH energy. Death Mercy starts very gentle with nice Jerry vocal and volume picks up in middle and end. Alligator pretty unique, havin' fun on the short. Not sure how well Feedback fits, but trippy.

Anyway, it's the same as the St Stephen> That's It For The Other one here listed as 8.29.68. Deadbase gives the first St Stephen as 5.24.68 so, assuming that St Stephen was first in setlists from May, and knowing that the filler is from the Carousel, it must be from either the end of May/beginning of June run or early June run at the Carousel.\n\nThe St Stephen is pretty tentative so it must be an early one (and the ending, as opposed to a William Tell Bridge) is a dead giveaway.\n\n(Deep breath) - sound right to you?

      "review_text": "Two shows: second is outstanding The beginning of this recording is from a \u201cshow\u201d called \u201c5/0/68\u201d here at Archive. It is definitely not from 8/23, with a very early St. Stephen.\u2014definitely not from August. (This \u201cshow\u201d is possibly a studio run-through for Anthem of the Sun.) It\u2019s good stuff, but not as exciting as the second show, the actual 8/23 material. A lot Caution in this first show is missing, unfortunately.\n\nStarting with the second Cryptical, we have a really outstanding show, part of an amazing run of 8/21, 8/22, 8/23, and 8/24 (released as \u201cTwo From the Vault\u201d \u2013 I agree that none of this 8/23 material is on Two From the Vault. The CD may use other songs from this show that aren\u2019t here).  The Cryptical reprise settles down to an almost introspective quiet section with understated organ, bass, and Jerry interplay. They holding back for several minutes before launching into the next extended jam, which simply ends. (No New Potato here, but there is a good one the previous night, 8/22/68.)\n\nThe Live Dead-era material is the highlight of these four shows. With this run of shows, they really got Dark Star right \u2013 this week began the golden age of Dark Stars. In this one, Jerry places every note where it should be, and Phil acts as Jerry\u2019s copilot. In contrast to the Anthem of the Sun material in this show, Dark Star is an introspective journey, as the best Dark Stars are, ebbying and flowing, rising and falling. Yet, it has musical form, and remains melodic. Comparabile to the 20th-century classical composers Nielson or Sebalius.\n\nWe get a classic St. Stephan, which explodes after the vocals just before The Eleven, then settles into the 3-3-3-2-metered (11/4 time) jam. Superb, The Eleven is exciting stuff, and it rocks. The transition into Death Don\u2019t Have No Mercy subtly begins at about 8 minutes with a key change. It\u2019s still jamming along in 11/4 at a fast pace, but is now in the minor key of Death. After a few minutes there\u2019s the gradual slowing in to Death Don\u2019t Have No Mercy. Unfortunately, there is a painful gap in the recording during the transition. (This transition is complete in the 8/21 show.)\n\nDeath Don\u2019t Have No Mercy is another great performance. Jerry\u2019s vocal and guitar transmit passion and anguish, as does the best of the blues.\n\nAlligator starts out bouncy, and we finally get to hear Pigpen, who is up to the task. After drums the Alligator reprise is exciting, electric, and inspired. Again, Jerry and Phil going to town. \n\nThe tracks are mislabeled here: Caution actually starts 16 minutes into Track 16, first the intro, then Pigpen goin\u2019 down to see the gypsy woman one fine day, yes he did. All you got have is just a little touch of mojo hand\u2026 It\u2019s wild and psychedelic, evolving into feedback. \n\nTrack 17 here is three minutes of feedback, or  space\u2014they\u2019re playing feedback like instruments in a musical composition, and a slow, quiet one at that. They touchdown for the landing, and we're back on earth.",

      "review_text": "One of '68s Best This whole run of 8/21-24 is just mind-blowing stuff. It's been said before but Fall '68 (starting here) thru April '69 has got to be one of the most consistently excellent and exciting periods of the band's history.\n\nThe Other One/Cryptical is fully formed by these shows and I think this could be my favorite of the four. Just sheer balls during TOO, Cryptical is gorgeously jammed out, rising to a wonderful peak and then quietly gliding to a halt. \n\nListening to this Dark Star again, man this is just great stuff. My new favorite of '68 - Jerry's range of tone, color and emotion is just mesmerizing. '68 Dark Stars may be seen by some as more \"one dimensional\" but not me. This is as good as it gets.\n\nThe Eleven - damn, the night after is great, but this trumps it easily. The speed and intensity of this version is unbelievable. Just when you think they're running out of gas, it picks up a full head of steam during the transition to Death Don't. That cut is a total bummer though.\n\nAnd Alligator>Caution - well, all I can say is there's a reason they included as a the Anthem bonus track; this is one of the best versions they ever did.\n\nThe only negative I could muster here (and this is nothing against the show itself) is the tracking is really poor. The beginning of St. Steven is at the end of Dark Star and Drums>Gator>Caution are all one track; kind of annoying.",

      "review_text": "Sleepy Alligator It was circa 1994 when my boy Pete's Dank rolled into town like a runaway freight train with this dirty nugg he had brought with him from Madtown.  We were all searching for the sound in those days and the score was a crispy lo-gen SBD.  When Pete unearthed this gem we could not believe our ears or our minds.  Break out the Maxell XLII-S.  The bus came by and our next stop was late summer '68 on the West Coast for an ivy league education in the Psychedelic Blues from Professor Pigpen.  Can you pass the acid test?  Let's just say I graduated magna cum laude and was ready to pursue a master's degree.\n\nThe meat is the Alligator > Drumz > Alligator > Caution.  Pig calls for his whiskey as the boys tear down the Fillmore, gas the Avalon and build a Shrine to mind-bending expansiveness.  A young Phillip Chapman Lesh unleashes his mighty bass as the Rhythm Devils pound away setting you off on a rocket ship to a higher existence.  Then Pig takes over and provides a history lesson in the blues involving a gypsy woman who schools him on the aspect that all one really needs is just a touch...of mojo hand.  The feedback is positive as you are left on a new potato caboose of graceful instuments where your love has become a toothless crone.\n\nFive stars on this one and thanks to Pete for dropping this nugg upon us.",
