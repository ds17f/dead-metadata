Fun to hear the banter before Dark Star that \"we once put this out as a single, an obscure single\" when they still talked on  stage.  Given how Deadheads dance, couldn't Dark Star be considered a \"dance track\"?",

      "review_text": "top 5! Sadly, there is so little from 1968 to pick from. A year which was, no doubt, packed with great performances - now lost to the cosmic ether. Or perhaps, people on another planet are receiving them along with our old 1960's TV broadcasts?? Food for thought.\n     I've had this show on tape for years, and now on CD. And although there's been some new good 1968 shows available lately, this show still remains one of my favorites. The Dead seem to often play their best under pressure, or when they share the stage - both of which are the case here. Historical note: this Miami Pop festival was partly produced by one Michael Lang, who would go on to create Woodstock a year later.\n     The sound quality is excellent throughout, again perhaps due to the festival SBD situation. The Lovelight is shorter than some, but it gets the job done. Dark Star is also very good, already beginning to sound like 1969. Garcia explores many colors and themes in only 10 minutes.\n     But it's the Eleven Jam where things really get rolling and tumbling with some really focused interplay between Phil, Jerry and the drums. Then The Other One - wow, Jerry just blasts at you right out of the Drums like a fire engine with siren at full tilt!! They saved Other One until last for a reason, and it's obvious they're giving it all they've got. Then they bring you back to earth with a beautiful, well-jammed Cryptical.\n     The only thing wrong with this show is it's too short! But a classic you need for your 1968 collection. Crank it up.\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

Listen to The Eleven from this night and from 1968-10-12, and you'll notice a more even crisp sound from the gig a few months ago.  I can only give this show an average of 3 stars quality, and the set list is not unique in-of-itself.  I think the Fillmore West show on 10-12 of the same year is better.",

      "review_text": "Grateful Dead at Gulf Stream In Dec 1968 at the Gulf Stream Race Park, site of the first Miami Pop Festival, I was introduced to the Grateful Dead. I had heard their first album several months earlier but I was completely unprepared for what I experienced that day. The festival had two stages, one in the middle of the race track for the famous bands and the other in the meadow for the less known bands. As I remember it being close to 100 degrees we were sitting in the shade of the meadows wathching James Cotton and awaiting a new band I had just heard called Sweetwater. After Sweetwater we were going to head back to the main stage to see Frank Zappa & the Mothers but I remember someone saying the Zappa was delayed so we stayed in the meadow to keep out of the extream heat. What happened next had a profound effect on the rest of my life, the Grateful Dead were announced to be the next band. As I mentioned I had heard the Dead's first album and loved the bluesy style of Good Morning Little Schoolgirl (as compared with Ten Years After more electric style)and the energetic garage band sound of New Minglewood so we stayed to hear them live. I was so BLOWN AWAY by this band that I could hardly believe my ears. Although the set's of the bands on the meadow stage were timed the crowd urged the Dead on and their set became the discussion of the day, (along with Zappa's set of Uncle Meat). Those of you who are listening to this set realize that they were playing in 100 degree heat (even in the shade) while being rushed by the concert promoters to finish their set so the next band could be set up for and the schedule maintained. It was a great show, a real eye opener for me, and a preview of the electric concert the next year at the Mickasookie Indian Reservation.",

      "review_text": "Miami Pop Festival #2 Just read over Alco's interesting remembrances from this show. A few details puzzle me: I haven't been able to find any corroboration that Frank Zappa was scheduled to play at either Miami Pop Festival--the one held the previous May or this one. Also, 100 degree heat? The highest recorded temperature in Miami during December was 87 degrees in 1902, and the news clippings from the December festival mention the weather as being \"balmy\". I'm not doubting your sincerity but I think maybe some memories are being conflated. Did you go to both festivals? From what I understand, the first festival had brutal heat the first day, and the second day was cancelled because of heavy rain. Or maybe your body temperature was artificially inflated because of, um, certain medications that you might've taken?:)\n\nEither way, your memory of the Dead set seems to be corroborated by this recording, which--despite it's flaws--indicates that it was indeed an incendiary show in all aspects. Now if only we could get a recording of that Frank Zappa hallucination you had afterward.....",

The smaller May festival was a two-day event, the second day of which rained out, produced by Michael Lang, and at which Frank Zappa did play. It was called the Pop & Underground Festival. The larger December festival was a three-day event produced by another team of people with no connection to Lang, featuring over thirty acts, and with weather balmy enough that many people wore short-sleeved shirts and some wore shorts. It was called the Miami Pop Festival. There has been a lot of confusion about the two events.",

I thought the Dead's set was just the right length, and loved that they played some music off their then-current second LP, \"Anthem of the Sun.\"  One guy next to me complained that their music was just too far out, but I loved them.  BTW, I didn't think the heat was extreme at all, although admittedly I was from the South (Mississippi by way of New Orleans).  Mid-80's during the days, and in the mid-70's at nite, which seems pretty perfect to me. Great festival -- well-organized, lots of great groups, excellent sound, mellow crowd, and the police presence was just fine.  I didn't think they were heavy-handed at all.  You knew they were there, but I saw no hassles of any kind by anyone, and I attended all three days, too.",
