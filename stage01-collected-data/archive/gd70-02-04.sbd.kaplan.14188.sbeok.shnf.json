In this modern age of all digital and no hiss etc., I still find myself drawn to these analog heirlooms, warts and all. I sure hope Chet Helms makes it into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.",

      "review_text": "Playing with tele <br />This was an invite-only show as part of a mini-festival that was put on by some hippies at KQED and Ralph Gleason, and videotaped for an NET special (PBS didn't exist yet). So, unlike most events here, instead of being promoted by Chet Helms the club was rented. After promotions company \"The Family Dog\" lost the Carousel, they found a ballroom, the Ocean Beach Pavilion, and used it as a venue for a rock club (Ocean Beach is at the western end of Golden Gate Park but this was actually a few block up, at the end of Balboa St). The venue was called \"Family Dog On the Great Highway\" (though the official release used \"At\"). There was a podium on each end for bands to set up, so NET would be able to film several bands [3 of the 4] without long waits.\n\nThis was the first night in home territory after busted down in New Orleans - must have felt like circling the wagons. For just a short while this was like a home venue - they played here 17 times in just 8 months. But the next time they played the name had changed to \"660 Great Highway\". It was eventually purchased for open space and today it's a vacant lot.\n\nNET at the time had scattered participation and it was up to local affiliates to decide whether to broadcast the show  later that year [or for most, probably not]. Back then, in many locales you had to switch your antenna to the UHF band (the 3 networks were on VHF band). On the vid, some missing footage is filled with slowed down B-roll, but at least it's not the usual early '70s rapid zooms, jerking camera, negative image or swirling background (usually anything but the actual person playing). The vid has just three songs from the Dead's set and does not use the same great audio source as the GDP release. For this format, the songs were tight and short [save Black Peter] and the playing restrained. On the plus side, this sounds different than other Feb '70 gigs and the quality of the official release is incredible - though none of the songs stand out against other Feb '70 versions. At the end is  a jam with Kaukonen, Garcia, Santana, Casady, and Santana's rhythm section. It's exactly the mess it sounds like on paper, though a couple brief moments are okay (it sounds like most free-form Santana from the era, but unpracticed).\n\nThe Set. There was probably a CR&S opener, as Pig would not have opened with <i>Hard to Handle</i>. But given the other sets by Santana, Airplane and the jam, that's probably all that's missing. <i>Black Peter</i> is wonderfully recorded (on the official). Jer gives one of his top vox deliveries, but otherwise it's very straight. The rest is solid but not remarkable, except a really good <i>China>Rider</i>, and a <i>Midnight Hour</i> that bogs down. The <i>Stephen>Not Fade>Stephen</i> is much better on the 8th.\n\nOverall = C+ / 3 stars\n\nSOURCES: Most SBD sources have buzzing underneath, and some are missing Black Peter, M&MU and/or the Multi Jam. The lack of separation makes some sources sound like processed mono. The kaplan_14188 is the fullest (other than the official). The miller_12130 is missing the first three songs. The GDP release is <b>Download Series: Family Dog at the Great Highway</b> but the non-GDP DVD is \"A Night at the Family Dog (a Ralph J. Gleason Rock Classic)\". The footage is on archive and usually up on YouTube, and is poorly lit [exacerbated by the use of early-tech videotape] .",
