The previous version of that song was at the Knick and Brent had a great rap that was well received and eventually made it to the live album.  But at this show, when Brent yells out a \"hold it\" to start his rap, Jerry totally cuts him off and starts Terrapin.  Blow Away was only played twice more and each without an ending rap.  I don't know if this added to Brent feeling like he wasn't an equal in the band. He did have a lot more songs in the setlists during his last year and they all were great.  He did a great Easy To Love You in the first set of this show.",

I was 22 years old and a senior at Whittier College and I don't recall  who got the tickets, but when I heard there was some extras available I knew it was a wonderful opportunity to finally see the dead.\n\nMy self and I'm remembering about 6 others. Split sown the middle guys and girls, packed up into a late model American Station Wagon and headed South to Carsom. We had already shared a couple of joints and were prepped with good and drinks on a super hot day ready for fun.  The weed was already in  full effect when we reached the gate leading to a giant flat green piece of land with the stage in the center.  To my left upon entrance we were fortunately greeted by a shaman white figure in white garb who offered us small white tabs of paper with a helicopter graphic on it. OH BOY! FREE ACID!!! We agreed to accept this generous offer on the condition we would all stay together and hold hands and not lose sight of eac hother. Miraculously we followed this principal and felt secure as the acid took effect.  My favorite moment of the show was their version of the weight.  I noticed by this time of the show that my face was sore from the permanent smile on my face that was imprinted by the all powerful sun behind the stage, but with some relief by the water cannons on each sides of the stage cooling us down with water and creating beautiful rainbows as the shudders of ecstasy filled my body as the whole crowd tried to sing along with the band \"AND ...AND...AND...YOU PUT THE THE LOAD (put the load) RIGHT ON ME!!!\" and a unified yelp and whoosh of sighs and screams and whoops for the effort to hit those melodic highs took their emotional toll. I looked around. Grandparents and babies in tie-dye's together and I knew there was no place I wanted to be then that very moment.",

      "review_text": "Same review Day 2 I was only 19 years old when I went to this my first and only dead show. I was also able to go both days, but I consider it to be one show all together. I am thankful that I was able to make it to see a live show. About a year prior to going when I was 18, dead fever had hit my small little town in Inland SoCal. A lot of us were loving the sixties stuff, and I crossed paths and made friends with a true deadhead that had lived in San Franciso, had seen many shows, and his parents were friends with Timothy Leary. He was actually like no one I had met, or have ever met since, and when I read about how special and unique Neal Cassady was I think of my friend. He was for me, like Cassady was to the band. I listened to every tape that I could get my hands on of the dead. Even before I went to a live show I fell in love with the music, and thought it was magical, timeless, and transcendent. It felt like even if I was listening to a song for the first time, I was like, \"Oh yeah, everbody knows this song! I love this song!\" but I had never heard it before. That is about as good as I can describe it in words. I had no idea that the dead were even in town the day that I went to this show. I had just got off work. My Cassady had already rambled on, but I made friends with another head that I worked with. We both worked the same shift(graveyard), and we were going to get in our cars and go home and go to sleep which was the routine at the time. Before we got to our cars a couple of his freinds that I kind of knew a little bit pulled up and asked him and I if we wanted to go the show, and they had extra tickets for us. Next thing I know were on our way the show. The rest was like a vivid dream. I could write a small book about it from the time we got there to the time we left, but to sum it up I was extremely satisfied with the band, the fans, and the whole thing. All my expectations were met if not exceeded. I smelled, touched, tasted, heard, and saw things that I never had the pleasure of experiencing before. They played all the songs that I really wanted to hear them play live, and the stuff I did not know at the time was just as good. The only thing that I was not happy about at the time, was my own performance, so to speak. I was not at my best, and going through a very depressing and frustrating time back in my regular day to day mud life. I was trying really hard to reach higher and be free of my junk, but I just could not quite get the gold ring. I wish I would have been 100 percent on but it just did not go down that way, everything else though was top notch. I did not know that Terrence Mckenna, and Timothy Leary were there, but now that I do it makes it all the more special to me that I was there too. I have been recently resting, reflecting, and taking a trip down memory lane. That is why I am here writing this review, and It makes me happy and excited about the future and dizzy with possibilities.",

I was not prepared for the heat and the high to be so intense. I went with a group from P.V. High all good friends. I think they were worried about me the entire time. None the less they made sure I didn't get too far gone. I was never \"that GUY\". We had a great time and after the show drove to Torrance Beach and went for a cool down. I only tripped a couple of times after that. I just decided to give it up I still have awesome flashbacks...when I hear one of the tunes played that day....it takes me back to that day. And I smile....ahhh youth.",

When some 20 somethings shooting beer from a keg in the back of their pick up got the flyer they turned to my pal and I and asked, What does blatant mean? I responded, \"That's like when you run up to a mounted police officer and throw a full beer bottle at his head.\" They nodded, and put a blanket over the keg. It was a tad warm.",

Garcia hip the crew in attendance. \n\nIf you find these shows 'mellow' it's because they were in the afternoon outside.\n\n@Famous KC Amos - So Sad, I knew Brian McCartie as well - great key board player. He passed on september 1990 in the mountains - great person, I loved his energy. ",

      "review_text": "Last time seeing Brent While the day before had the set list, it was so sloppy, that this one stands the test of time much better.  This show is more in line with the hi caliber, east coast swing the month before.  We were pretty close on Brent's side both days, and everyone was sweating their asses off.  We dubbed it the slime dance.  But it was fun and nice dancing barefoot on the grass.\n\nYep, it was hot, but nowhere near 108....heads would have been dropping like Tommies going over the top at the Somme if it were.   Back out in the parking lot, the dust just caked you.  I remember the pool back at our hotel had about an inch of dirt settled in the bottom of the pool.\n\nWhen Brent sang \"Gonna be along, long crazy afternoon,\"  Bobby broke into a laugh/grin and stepped away from the mike.  He recovered quickly, but it was an amusing moment.  And during Blow away, I just couldn't believe the talent Brent possessed.  To this day , I can't understand why some heads have a bit of a distain for him.  I get it, some/most of his original songs were weak, but he was the best keyboardist the Dead ever had by a country mile, and added such a depth, especially during solos and jams, that Keith, Vince, Bruce, Tom could never touch.  And the on-stage rapport he build with Jerry was amazing to see, esp after Jerry moved from stage right to stage left back in the early '80's to be closer to him.\n\nThis show is 3.5 stars, but I'll round up for nostalgia's sake.",
