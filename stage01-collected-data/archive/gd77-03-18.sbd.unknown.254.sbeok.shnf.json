This archive is a candy store and I'm a little kid with a sweet tooth. The sound here is soooo good. Sugaree is IMHO the best ever, bar none. The sound is so rich, the band just plugs along like locomotive bound for glory (arriving at it several times). Thanks Archive. Give this sugaree a good hard listen, it is the high point of music since the dawn of man (and woman). Keith's piano on the second solo is the recipe for goosebumps. The monstrous build up and immediate collapse at the end of the second solo is exhausting. Wow, just listen to it and and marvel and smile.",

It's also good Terrapin.\n\nThe Not Fade Away starts out with nice bounce similar to efforts of a few previous years, but with the addition of '77 guitar style. It then builds into something else, with Phil doing a brief Caution riff a la 1969. (An unfortunate patch here, but we're lucky that section isn't missing altogether.)

Its hard for me to think anything before the 90's has any but fantastic guitar playing (even if its hard to make out). I try and look at some other aspects of the show as a basis for comparison. The vocals on this show are clear and melodious. I like Donna...sue me!:)...and here she is really great. No wailing to hurt the ears and she really puts some musical muscle into the vibe. The NFA isn't the best cult version... but I agree that around the Caution riff something quite good is going on in Jerry's head. Its one of the more diverse jam outs I have heard and the harmony interplay really highlights the younger voices working the mics. \n\nI would go listen to 6-28-76 if you haven't already.

Sugaree is a definite contender although I still love the Dicks Picks 3 version the best.  Great 1/2 step, but compared to the 5/8/77 Boston version everything else is second best.

After being introduced to the two February show that kicked the year off (and if you haven't yet heard them then you must do so immedietly) I discovered this Winterland stand, and in particular this show.\n\n  I have listened to this over two evenings and there are noteworthy versions of so many different songs.  So as not to just repeat what has already been stated, I will try to point out some of the distinctive moments that help to make this such a breathtaking show.  The band, individually and as a unit, is ablaze the entire show.  Note the way they repeatedly move from playing LOUD to playing ultra quiet within the same song.  Jerry experiments with new approaches in virtually every song.  Half step sounds totally new and different.  Nothing is rushed.  Towards the end of Sugaree the band enters a wild Jam as Keith takes his solo.  Check out the Drums/Piano/Bass interaction that occurs.  Extraordinary.  Minglewood is unrestrained garage band rock and roll.\nThe stretch of songs in the second set, beginning with Terrapin and continuing through the Uncle John's encore is bedazzling.  This is a band with many faces and many moods.  Not Fade Away is the center piece in many ways.  If you like Cornell then give this a listen as a worthy counterpoint.  They move through different chapters, from the way back groove that starts the song to the Caution jam that climaxes with a Viola Lee like crescendo, to the beautifully quiet ending that reveals the 1st notes of Stephen like a sunrise on the beach!  This is a deeply moving contribution to the universe.  Jerry is so amped during Around that I had to turn the volume down.  I can picture the mayhem that must have been the floor of  Winterland as they drop it into over drive at the end.  This show easily takes its place alongside the other storied shows from 1977 and any other year for that matter!",

After comparing over the past 4 months, and with 36 years following the band, I must say the Sugaree, Peggy-O, and FOTM from this concert are my personal faves.  The unique rendition of Terrapin is in the top five as well.\n\nSomehow, the band was just in perfect form for this show, delivering with the powerful gentility that makes the Grateful Dead so unique among all bands.  Phil's performance the entire night, but especially on Fire and Sugaree is simply extraordinary.  Why was Phil so focused and more active than usual that night?  We will likely never know, but his usual playing \"lead\" bass about 50% of the time was around 90% of the time on Mar 18th, 1977.\n\nPersonally, I think that Phil's outstanding work during this show was the catylist that got the whole band \"hitting at 120%\", and added that little extra something that makes the songs from this show so highly rated by so many.\n\nNo Dead collection can be complete without this show!\n\nStay in touch!",

However I was at the Swing 1977-2-26(Sat) and there most definitely not did they play 'Scarlet Begonias' > 'Fire on the Mountain'! Therefore this again most definitely was indeed the debut of 'Fire on the Mountain' live as we know it i.e. not counting as it was previously known 'Happiness is drumming'. Which as such, was performed by Mickey's Diga Rhythm Band which for those who don't know included Garcia & Zakir Hussain on tabla! \n      Now as far as \"penis\" controversy I'm undecided? I never noticed it before reading your comments but I must admit; whatever he is singing it isn't normal! I would refer you'll to the sometimes known as the \"Rap\" version in the studio version with Mickey Hart singing or rapping all of Hunter's lyrics with Steve Miller playing guitar! It might have been released on one of the collection albums like \"So Many Roads\" or another I'm not sure about that?\n     Despite that silliness, I'm certainly in agreement with those such as Arukamon & doug_the_dude and some others as well, who really know what they're talking about; yet it's not about our egos, it's about truth! Yes these versions of 1/2 Step, Sugaree are quite nice but I hate to say are not the best I've the best (indeed the one at the afore mentioned Swing is pretty good or Ventura '83 but my faqvorite is -1979-12-28(Fri) which has many totally mind blowing tune renditions) as well as that of 'Fernario' etc.. or even one of my Bob favorites 'It's All over Now' was much better in October '78 when I taped for my first time at Winterland! On the other hand indeed, 'Not Fade Away' is pretty darn hot yet even that I can think of several that are even more outrageous like U.C.S.B. my freshman year 1978-6-4(Sun) with the Hell's Angel's motorcycle for one is pretty rousing! However 'St. Stephen' here is indeed one of my favorite's although the only one I saw (therefore a tad biased) at U.C.L.A. the night before Winterland's closing has a unique jam where Garcia goes through the scale on the jam the opposite way he normally does! But here 'Around & Around' is totally out there! \n      In any case for the instrumental At a Siding part of Terrapin Station this show still deserves a 5 To bad I couldn't have gone!\n      Augy,\n      San Diego",

I have a CD from the 80's that gives the timing of the individual parts of this piece. What they played in other concerts was almost always the first *three* parts \u2014 'Lady with a Fan', 'Terrapin Station', and 'Terrapin'.\n\nWhat they played in this concert, and which is labeled here 'Alhambra' is a barely recognizable 'Terrapin Transit', followed by 'At a Siding' up to just before where the lyrics start on the album. Then, what is labeled as 'Drums' includes a jam at the start which is the beginning of 'Terrapin Flyer' on the studio album.",
