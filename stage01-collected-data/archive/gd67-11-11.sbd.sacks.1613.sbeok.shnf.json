They were so far ahead of others and had such a varied repetroire. Just listen to the licks and imagine a young Greg,and especially, Duane Allman(living in LA at the time) listening to this...GET it. I play in a band and as the youngest member at almost 48 ..I still can't believe how many experienced musicians and aficianados still don't get it.

And yes that's Pigpen on keyboards, Tom Constanten didn't join until November of 1968. Going back to these old shows reminds me how integral Pig's organ originally was to the Dead sound. The boys play with an energy and quickness they ocasionally matched but never surpassed in subsequent years. Another great show from this era is 03/18/67 at the Winterland.",

I like this New Potato, which has some great jamming. Death Don't  Have No Mercy is also hot.\n\nThere's no Born Cross-eyed because they hadn't started playing it yet. The first performance was 1/17/68, according to Deadbase (which also says they only performed it 4 times.)\n\nA little audio funkiness at the beginning of Lovelight, but it doesn't diminish the show.",

I was on a bikeride, about 7 miles and I was riding along a cliff. At one point, during the Cryptical Envelopment Jam, I was riding along and I could see the Pacific Ocean and all of my town below. It was an amazing feeling.\nI love the lead guitar solo in Lovelight, the organ and guitar interplay in Death Don't Have No Mercy, the harmonica in Schoolgirl, the early lyrics in The Other One, and the rare glockenspiel contributed by Mickey Hart in New Potato Caboose. Although the performances are all five star, the sound gets a little muddier after Schoolgirl.",
