      "review_text": "One of the best of the 1968 I\u2019ve listened to almost all of the \u201968 shows hear at Archive, as well as those that the Dead released. This one is as good as the February/March shows, and a few from August. One of the rare features it that not only is the \u201cLive Dead\u201d set list top notch, but the Anthem of the Sun material is also excellent. This show compares well to many \u201969 shows as well.\n\nThis tape starts with an exceptional Schoolgirl, already in progress. The jamming and Pig\u2019s vocals are fresh and exciting. In the second half, Jerry lays back and Phil has an extended solo, a real treat for Phil fans.\n\nThe jamming in Lovelight is similarly hot in spots. It doesn\u2019t quite gel like some of the \u201969 shows, but it is a good Lovelight none-the-less.\n\nThe show gets serious with Dark Star is one of best in the golden age of Dark Stars. Moody and lyrical, it flows hear and there, but is a well-crafted composition. Nothing compares to it after 1970.\n\nNext is a Live-Dead-style St. Stephen (in which Jerry cooks) and The Eleven. St. Stephen is perfect, and the Eleven rips--as good as any in 1969. Jerry and Phil duel it out in the first part, then Jerry takes off. Then something unusual happens towards the end: Caution. In this period, The Eleven sometimes transitions into Death Don\u2019t have no mercy. The Eleven into Caution was not common, but it works well here, an interesting transition from Live-Dead-style back into Anthem of the Sun material. The transition is completely seemless. \n\nPipen\u2019s organ starts off Caution, then he begins his rap with a call-and-response. Things get decidedly more pychedelic. The Caution jam kicks in, wild, electric, exciting, but tight and musical. Just dynamite. Things calm down a bit, then revs back up to a short climax, then a transition into feedback.\n\nUnlike the space of later years (which often signaled time for a bathroom break), this feedback is a compelling group composition that holds your attention. In the end, it transitions smoothly into the 60-cycle hum of the PA.\n\nThis show is worthy of many repeat listens.",

The Eleven, has the only proper cut I listened to, they always have those lyrics before the jam as part of St.Stephen, but as part of The Eleven they just add so much to jam.  A nice build up right after St. Stephen ends.  I hate the ratings system. Half the people who listen to the dead listen to a ton of stuff in the 90's and 80's and so a ton of those shows are rated better.  Which is just anyone's opinion really... usually cause they were at the show.  I would give shows 5's just for having a amazing one song in there.  Like 10-29-78, not truly amazing, but the Sug Mag just has some the best drums of any version I have listened to.  I gave it a 5 just for that but...",

If we being, rushing alongside the songs they play chronologically, we will feel the bass within us as it moves alongside the grooves in Schoolgirl. This is only a small movement- the dynamics are graceful and beauteous and alive and powerful and intrinsic! A force is at work within each song, each musician surely possessing that force. I can feel something within this music no experience can give. But to arrive at the wonderment Dark Star produces in ethereal lands transcending the stage, you too will surely notice a glimpse of this. Intrinsic power and transcendental grace! And how it moves onward throughout the Eleven and Caution, something so strong and scary that comes alive in full fluid movements! Unlike anything!... A complete amount of harmonious force and energy is conveyed here. One of their most brilliant moments in '68 (though it transcends brilliance). It goes onward in a fully achieved transcendental dance and moves in some way that I lack words to describe. Just listen",

The levels are WAY uneven in Schoolgirl. Phil is way at the top and vocals are too low. Vocals are unfortunately too low for most of this recording. Lucky for us this is more of an instrumental performance. Once Dark Star starts at least the instrument levels are corrected. These are shorter performances of each of these songs than what they would develop into very shortly.

Jerry and Phil had talked about firing both of them.\n\nApparently the Dead didn't think this show was up to snuff, and consequently didn't play the Greek theatre for another 13 years. Personally I think it's one of the best from 68. It's stunning actually and Pigpen is ON. So's the rest of the band.

I think this was a conscious decision to mix him out (until the euorpe 72, 2 tracks he's in the mix and the multitracks he's there.

The night before in Vegas was the first for Tom Constanten. Because he was stationed there, he didn't play this show, not appearing again until 11/25 in OH (we do have the next show, in Chico - in between were Mickey & the Hartbeats shows). Instead, Pigpen was back. After missing shows when his girlfriend was in critical care and due to the firing incident, he plays here with enthusiasm. This date was the \"All Cal Rock Festival\" - the type of booking which again gave them an occasion to play the Greek. Usually they played down the hill on campus, at the Harmon Gym or Pauley Ballroom (which they next played at UC, for summer solstice '70). It would be 13yrs until an opportunity to play the Greek again (also in the afternoon). Given the set length, the Dead were probably not the headliners. Short, but what's here is the best of fall '68.\n\n<i>Good Morning Schoolgirl</i> is good, and mostly owned by Phil, though he goes on independent study in places. The beginning is clipped - the first 7secs on the official release are from 8/24. <i>Lovelight</i> is similar to any from the period, but <i>Dark Star</i> is a structured delight (again missing the very beginning - the first 9secs on the OFF are from 8/24). <i>Saint Stephen</i> is extraordinary into <i>The Eleven</i>. They had been woodshedding these as they worked to add TC, and now they are red. <i>Caution</i> is one of the tightest and most entertaining versions.\n\nOverall = 5 stars\n\nHighlights:\nDark Star through Caution are aces\n\nSOURCES: The miller_9071 is the SBD upgrade; essentially the same on <b>30 Trips</b> (you may want to swap their channels for accuracy).

He has cited Jack Casady as a major influence early on, and that heavy style is heavily apparent here. Lovelight rolls along nicely. Dark Star is immediately identifiable as a \u201868 version, with Pigpen\u2019s descending organ line and the quiet percussion providing soft framework as the Gibsons purr along briskly at varying volumes and directions. It\u2019s a spooky, cavernous, and vampirish Dark Star, with none of the looseness, huge shifts in tempo, or sweeping barrel roll maneuvers of many \u201869-\u201970 versions. One of the shortest St. Stephens in history segues into what I\u2019d call the show\u2019s highlight: a ferocious The Eleven. Caution is half frenzied rock & roll, half celestially tripped out feedback, the perfect cherry on top of this old school California cookout. It\u2019s only about an hour long, but takes you on a real adventure in those half a dozen songs. MVP of the night goes to Phil Lesh!",
