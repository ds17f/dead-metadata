Head over to etree.org and check out the information there about lossless compression and download MKW or another file converter.  It takes about 5 seconds to convert this file from SHN to WAV for use in any MP3 player or PC jukebox, whatever, and even the most software illiterate person (myself is a good example) can easily figure out how to use it. This file is definitely worth the five minutes of extra effort you might have to take to obtain the software needed to convert it to WAV.",

This is Deadbase only WITH the music!  It took me about 15 minutes - with some help from a friend - to figure how how to convert SHN files to WAVE, etc.  It is easy - once you know how - and best of all FREE!  Anyway, good luck man...  All I can say is that the minimal amount of effort required will be repaid ten fold, TRUST ME... I do know what you mean as most shows are available in mp3, but you can convert to mp3 yourself if you visit here :\n\nhttp://www.etree.org/mkw.html\n\nGood Luck and Happy Listening!  Oh, and I should add that I meant no offense in my comments.  I re-read them after I posted this and it could sound like I was being an A--hole and that was not my intent.  I hope this info helps...",

Or whether they'd rather be run over by a steamroller on a hot day with an empty stomach or a cold day with a full stomach?  If so this is your download.  This is a real fun listen, you'll enjoy it.  Some poignant conversation surrounding Garcia's then recent brush with death and its impact on the band.  I'd love to see some more uploads along this vein...lots of fun!
