Don't get me wrong; this is a fine sounding version of an amazing show and would easily rate 5 stars if complete.\n\nThis omission is much more substantial than the tape flip mentioned in the notes.  Is a file missing, perhaps?  If anyone can provide a complete version of this show it would be a valuable addition to the archive.\n\nTo archive.org:  you guys are awesome! Keep up the good work.",

Jerry, Brent, Phil, the Devils are just on fire, and of course there is Bobby with that 82 voice that I love. Ripping solos by Jerry, Brent, and even Bobby on the slide. Phil is booming all over the place. Into Sugaree. Oh man a thick groove. Jerry sounds like an angel. Again Jerry shreds all the solos. This is a real head banging version. Into Rooster. This is a delicious Rooster. Incredible intro with Phil adding some grate bass. Again Bobby brings it vocally. Jerry takes a big turn, followed by a grate solo by Bobby. What makes this one of my favorite Roosters is Brent singing, \"Hey Little Red Rooster well you aint shit to me.\" His voice just sounds so raw and dirty its awesome. Then he rips it up on the B3. They come to the first stop and go into a groovy Jed. Very nice. Im not the biggest fan of Cassidy, cuz imo it can sometimes suck the life out of a set, but this is a grate version. Nice and tight and the Jerry and the Boys are just unconscious on the jam. Cassidy could have been a second set song, if they had just turned the corner on the jam. HEAVY Loser. Jerry rips a phat one and heartfelt vocals. Followed by the best Far From Me Ive heard. Brent's voice is perfect on this one. Jerry has some nice runs on this one. Ethereal Looks Like Rain. Emotional heartfelt singing by Bobby. Searing solo by Jerry. The coda is awesome. Into a funky bouncy China Cat. Jerry is again on fire with some very slick runs. Into a ripping Rider. Wow!!\n\nIMHO the second set is a huge let down from the first set, but maybe they just blew their load on the first set. No complaints from me. I love those tight 82 shows. The Boys are in fine form for this smoker. Get the first set if you wanna hear some smoking Dead. Im gonna make believe the second set doesnt exist and give this one five stars for the first set.  \n\nMandatory Listening (First Set)",

This version of \"Crazy Fingers\" is the best played of the 1982 versions.....I'm not going to go through every song but by the time they get to \"Sugar Magnolia\", Phil is dropping bombs left and right and the band is in high gear.\n.....I don't know, I think it's pretty amazing music.",

The first set songs at the end of the set which once occupied the b-side (remember XL II-s) and had garcia solos that were dead on perfect one song after the other.  The fact that they were some of my favorite song solos for him to play made it all the better.  I'm talking about his solos on Far from me, then Loser, then Looks, then Rider.  Front to back, one of the best first sets of the year and top twenty of the decade.  The second set features my favorite sailor (for those of us who love this song) and one of the most furious solos garcia ever took part in-- at the end of saint.  This one is my favorite show from one of my favorite years and one that should be had by anyone who likes the 80s.",

It sounds muddy in all kinds of places but it's a very good sounding recording I think, it holds up and more, a thick bottom end. All sources of this show have the same after effect from what iv'e heard. It could have been the mix that day,the acustics or maybe the master tape is lost and a flawed and very good 2nd gen recording has been floating around all these years. Playin jam is alot of fun. but I like the lst set much better.3.5 for sound 4 for playing and 5 for many of the song versions. I think Frost 82 is due for a clean-up and major release on cd. How bout it guys. 9/9/82? I know fans talk about that show as much as any,at least for the 80's allright.",

This set has such an eerie feeling to it, but maybe its just the tape?  Don't think so.  Jerry is extremely lucid, especially on the Playin' Jam/Crazy Fingers.  I love the way Jerry leads the band through the Playin' Jam, you can hear Bob and Brent trying to keep up with his melodies and having trouble.  Phil has no trouble on this night.  Wish I had a time machine for this one.",

Personally I liked the first show a little better because of song selection, but the execution of this show is impeccable, no warts here. I know there is a more complete copy of this show out there. I was there, from Boulder, Co., with my buddy Mike Gardner who had a cast on his leg and we smuggled the mics in his cast and used the crutches for mic stands. I have, over the years lost my copy and lost touch with Mike. (If you're out there, Mike, upload both these shows please, and look me up in SLC, Ut., Frank)",

Unfortunately \"Space\" is missing but, other than that this show is on Fire ! In no way does the band go through the motions on this night. Upon listening you can hear how each member is pushing the other to higher and higher levels. Satisfaction is a great reflection of this. This is a prime example of what made the Grateful Dead so good. So if you don't have it get it enjoy it and tell your friends ! On a side not not that it even matters what I think but, I have never given a show  5 stars before.",

I think I must boldly proclaim that this is one of the best recordings commercial, or not, that I have ever heard. The Grateful Dead come roaring out of the starting gate and keep it up all day. Now, don't get me wrong, his may not be a dazzling overall show, performance wise, but it sounds so good you don't care. Many have said the previous day was a better show by virtue of song selection, but I may disagree. First set is very well done, but the second set is simply jaw-dropping. The Playing>Fingers>Sailor>Saint>Touch>Drumz>Wheel is absolutely stellar. Now, I am not a big Touch head, mind ya, but this one will stunt your growth and even the NFA, which is one of my least favorites due to its beat annoying me, is a torch carrier which keeps the remaining portion of set 2 volcanic. Of course, due to fact that I stopped going I never heard them perform Crazy Fingers or Satisfaction live, but this recording makes up for  times missed.",

I discovered this when I tuned up my guitar to play along with the amazing Cassidy jam, only to find out that I was not in tune with the recording! I wondered if the boys were tuning to some standard other than 440 Hz, so I checked a different version (https://archive.org/details/gd1982-10-10.sonyecm220T.keshavan.miller.93733.sbeok.flac24). Lo and behold, I was perfectly in tune with that one. Note also that the song lengths are greater in the second version I tried (e.g. Little Red Rooster is a full minute longer) confirming the speed issue. Accordingly, the first version sounds a little like helium was added to the list of inhalants. Recording still gets four stars!",

Opened eyes during lost sailor and noticed I was making a long tall dust cloud and was quite isolated.  Felt awkward for a moment and then noticed kind smiles.  Found a grassy spot and continued to dance.  I never felt so much a part of music in my life.  Still think this was a magical show.  I'm not a Bobby guy, but his songs were so great this day: Cassidy, LL Rain, LS>St Circ, Throwing Stones, NFA... all of them.  Cassidy, Tennessee Jed, LS>St Circ, Throwing Stones, Far from Me and Baby Blue rank #1 all-time version in Headyversion voting and LL Rain is #2 all time.  Satisfaction is 3rd (behind the encore version that probably, over 100 degrees, put Jerry in a coma).  Rumor is Bobby just had a break-up.  The sound there was incredible, even from outside, where I was the day before.  Phil's bass sounds amazing and Jerry is fluid as a watery jaguar.  This is one of the great shows.  Try the Rango matrix (Seaman's) too, because his AUD tape blends great w the SBD and the crowd vibe is great.  This show is an example of why Phil talks so fondly of the 80s.  His playing is worth a close listen throughout.",
