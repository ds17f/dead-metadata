But these shows just confirmed my fears.  Until post-space, this one was going down the tubes fast.  Jerry was somewhere else altogether.  But in Days Between, he snaps out of it, and delivers, for me, the last glimpse of his true greatness.  His solo here is fairly gut-wrenching, especially taken in the context of the times.  After Days, lights out.\n\nThen bringing back Mud.   I thought that one had been put to bed for good a la Dayjob in the Brent era.

In summary, it's not at all essential to download this show, but you should definitely download \"Days Between.\"  (You may wish to also download the very good \"Black Muddy River\" and \"New Speedway\"-- both were unexpected treats).  Lastly, this was my final Dead show, and it wasn't a bad one to end on.  Bruce sat in that night, there were some good moments, and I thought the band played better than I'd seen the previous weekend at Giants Stadium.  Fare thee well, Jerry.",

Anyhow, this show was my second to last show, my friend and I had tixs for the rest of the summer tour but we decided to trade them for some stuff and wound up vending the rest of the tour.   There were some shakey moments of almost every gd show I have seen, of course this year there seemed to be a lot more, however, I still have yet to see a band that puts forth the love like the gd did (a band that comes close but who are not on this website is GM).  Regardless, this show wasn't the worst nor was it best...some moments came to fruition and some moments really disappointed.  \n\nFor some reason the highlight, for many including my friend, of the show was Garcia jamming with Dylan however, if I remember correctly:  Roster Saint NSB and Days were all pretty solid as was Jack Straw.  Promised had a nice finish but no great shakes for everything...\nI would probably put this show at a 2.5 but I think 3 covers it...not a failure but not above average.",

I have tended to avoid 95 shows in general, as I was present at the blossoming of much of the bad juju that was going around the last couple of tours and didn't like it at all.\n\nBut I loved RFK shows in general, and just listened to most of this one kind of by accident at work.\n\nIt is true that this is not Jerry of '77, the young lion roaring.  But it is a very passable old lion reminding us that he was once formidable, and learned many things on that road that are worth listening to.\n\nBruce pushes him nicely (although I heard someone claim once that Bruce stole Jerry's soul, and I wish I could refute that more easily than I can) throughout (Promised Land, Iko stand out on that stretch), and the Days Between bears great witness to what Steve Silberman wrote of the song: that it is \"the most uncompromisingly adult lyric Hunter ever wrote.\"\n\nThe recording is maybe a little  hot (FYI: I am listening to the online stream), with some bumps and pops, but conveys the intimacy and volume compassion with which RFK would reverberate with a good concert pretty well.  And I love any show at which Phil is THIS LOUD.\n\nRIP Jer. We miss you.",

I owned for many years a crappy audience tape of this show and yet the Days Between would still make my hair stand on end; perhaps it was the deliberate manner in which Jer teased out a huge jam, perhaps it was the rest of the boys providing a sympathetic backdrop for him to do so.  Whatever the case may be, this Days absolutely stands the test of time and is worth it regardless of the rest of the show.  This is the sort of thing one plays for friends who gave up on the Dead after '89 when one wants to prove them \"wrong...\" The '95 Dead will never compare to '69,  '73, '77, '85, etc.  However, this is an absolute monster version of this song and should be treated as such.",

And god know that the Jerry was so lame at most of these shows that the band should have been handing out refunds.\n\nBut listen to them charge through New Speedway Boogie with Hornsby.  Many times on this tour as I have said before on this archive, something would happen and Jerry would suddenly \"wake up\" and play a string of glittering notes or sometimes just get down so deep you would wonder \"Where the hell did that come from?\"\n\nLots of talk about the \"Days\" here but this \"New Speedway Boogie\" is probably my favorite version of the song with the exception of the night they revived it in February of '91.  I saw them play it a few times in the 90's and it was never as good as this. They seemed to just run through it most times.\n\nHere Jerry suddenly seems to get down. Hornsby catches the moment.  The band realizes that Jerry is suddenly there and let's give 'er. Check out the jam after the second verse and you'll hear why I would have walked away from this smoldering ember of a gig smiling.\n\nGod bless the Grateful goddamn Dead!\n\nThree stars for the sound (one of the few AUD's of the 92-95 period I like) and three for NSB and Days.",

Even Promised Land [a song I heard way too many times] was decent.  And Jerry's playing has been good for '95.  More importantly, his singing is solid for a guy whose voice was shot from years of smoking cigs and drugs.  Jack Straw was pretty damn good.  Actually remember dancing to it back by the sound board and thinking that maybe he'd gotten things in check after the last show I'd seen [first night in Jersey.  Nuff said].  Anyway, rest of set is decent with So Many Roads being a highlight for me.  Truth be told, of all the '95 shows I saw and/or have listened to, this is pretty much the only first set where I wasn't asking \"where's Jerry\".  Nothing searing, but pretty leads in which you can feel and hear the pain and fatigue of all those years of life on the road giving his all for us dead heads.  Moved closer to the front for the second set which is just starting now with what I consider a fairly energetic, albeit \"standard\", version of Iko Iko. Never liked Vince's vocals [tolerated his playing b/c Hornsby sitting in on many of the post-Brent shows], and usually preferred Samba over Way to go Home.  But this version of WTGH is actually listenable.  Probably b/c Jerry can be heard playing behind the vocals. But once again, band in sync.  Only thing missing is a searing jam....  And that is pretty much how the rest of the set went- -other than Days Between and New Speedway Boogie.   I remembered standing in RFK thinking the lead on Days Between was one of the most haunting, yet beautiful, leads I'd ever heard.  Even more haunting than some of the killer Stellas of prior decades- -perhaps because Jerry was projecting his own pain rather than having to channel the regrets, loses, and sorrows of others.  And New Speedway Boogie was always good to hear.  Great lyrics, and Jerry seemed to enjoying singing it.\n\nLong story longer and even more tedious....  Almost 18 years ago my buddy and I trained back to where his car was parked, then drove to his house in Potomac wondering why we didn't get to hear any \"dead jams\" and musing about how old and tired and smacked out Jerry looked.   As I sit here today listening once again, it actually sounds good.  Not vintage Dead.  But good pace.  Decent energy.  And if Bobby hadn't jumped in with the vocal on Saint of Circumstance, it had some potential to get to that next level.\n\nWhatever the case, very listenable.  Solid for summer 1995.  I am reversing my original assessment, i.e. I now think Jerry's overall playing was better the next night.  But at the end of the day, no regrets about attending either show.  Only regret?  That Jerry never had the chance to get clean, lose some weight, and get back on the road as a healthy man.  Don't wish this for me [sure,I'd give a lung for one more show], but for Jerry.  He gave his heart, body, and soul to the fans.  He deserved some time to live for Jerry.",

The only real high point was Bruce, with the occassional Bobby input.  This may have been the lamest show that I saw over 22 years of active show going.",

We had spent most of the day under the bridge by the river listening to the drum circles and then the encore was Black Muddy River.  Anytime I hear BMR it brings tears to my eyes.",

Hands down, no debate, chilling on a hot summer night. New Speedway->TWBS I remember well. Final FOTD. The music was amazing, I just don't understand where the criticism comes from. Did you see the same show as me?? The Althea was great and the Jack Straw opener, Yes! I've seen worse shows in the 80's This one, IMHO, goes down in history. ",

The grateful dead was turning a corner, from playing rock and roll to playing more soulful and spiritual. Alot of people mistook this for lazy playing or seeing a \"bad concert\". I'm glad of seeing many shows in the 90's and being there for the experience. Peace and love all the way.",

Is it summer '74? Is it spring '77 or '90? Is it the Warfield/Radio City in fall '80?\n\nDuh.\n\nBut it's happy Jerry, sounding and playing darn well given what was going on with him healthwise \u2013\u2013 Bruce and Dylan were catalysts for him and the entire band, I think. The interplay between Vince and Bruce and Phil throughout is top notch.\n\nI'll never understand comments like those from @Faretheewell. God bless ya, mate, you didn't like it. Go pittle on someone else's lawn, maybe. No way you can listen to songs like Jack, Althea, Rooster, Promised Land (tho the end of this recording gets off track \u2013\u2013 so, do yourself a favor and crank another copy of this sparkling hot version), New Speedway, and Days Between and then objectively and call this show \"pathetic\". How silly.\n\nDead ahead, always!",
