      "review_text": "Next Nite Magic As was the case for the Dead for most of 1994, if you didn't like the mood/music of one night, just wait till the next... Sure enough, this was a solid show right through and through... Although short and not extremely jammed... there are some moments in this show were hope really shown through.   The sound quality was good and the song selection, although normal, was solid.  Really good renditions of FLAS, Stagger, and Broken Arrow set up the first set for a very good Eternity and, somewhat surprise, Bertha closer.  The Second set's China>Rider duo was solid enough and a good verision of Saint and He's gone (complete with vocal jam at end) were also highlights (not to mention that they sandwich a pretty good version of WTGH).  The obvious peak song was a stunning rendition of Stella Blue, Jerry sung his heart out on this one and the cresendo solo put a definative exclaimation point on this verison.  Like clock work, Bobby reminded the hippies that it was saturday night and then we all were disapointed with the selection of IFTL to close... Oh well, can't have em all... Sound quality of the download is very good as well... Thanks again Archive.org!!!",

Vince is all over it ..He sounds like PigPen from a 66 Viola Lee with that Carnival-like Keyboard Rifting...and he also provides some tight backups on one of those LL refrains.  5 stars for Vince being on.  Only one other show where I heard (and saw) him being as ON as he is in LL...that show was umm, Boston Garden, 10-3-94.  But this show here is Vince's Best Played show of all time...Anyone got any contenders?",

The Stella is one of the very rare magical moments of the Vinnie era (some others--Standing and Slipknot- Eugene '93, Mothers day Shorline first set- '91, Visions- Utah '95)  The solo in this Phoenix Stella is truly breathtaking.\n\nHealy got fired, as far as I know, for being an 'enabler.'  Not the subtle (Here's a hundred dollars) kind either.\nDstone5553@aol.com",

He now crossed the line probably after warning and that obviously affected the rest of the band's live show performance and its fans. If I remember correctly Dan didn't like Bobby and it became a bigger problem someone had to go and it wasn't going to be Bobby.",

I was not disappointed! My life was changed forever by this music. I was very lucky to have seen Jerry on a good night at this point. From Stranger on my jaw was on the floor, I had never heard anything like this! Imagine hearing this drumz>space having no idea it was coming! Beautiful. Thank you Archive.",

      "review_text": "Healy and Cutler In Phil's book he says that Healy really pissed off Weir when he would mess with his vocals during tunes like The Other One. As well, I have heard that Healy had developed a pretty bad drinking problem. I don't know for sure 'bout that part, but yes it is pretty clear that Healy and Weir did not get along.\n\nI know I read somewhere that 3-16-94 was Cutlers first show as soundman, but I can't find where I read that info now that I look for it, so I could easily be persuaded that this was Cutler's first show with a little proof. \n\nGreat sounding show here. Better than average performance IMHO. Stella Blue marks the beginning of the Big Stella Blue refrain/solo end segment that was to accompany most Stella's throughout 94.",

      "review_text": "Good tight and rocking show Though pretty light on the jams and fairly short, this show has a lot of energy and solid playing. Jerry and Vince especially. Jerry has that characteristic acoustic Lightning Bolt sound going and he's dancing, dipping and darting. Check out China Cat, it's a real barn burner of a version. And Vince plays some really nice organ (Loose Lucy rocks) and e piano and keeps the weirder synth tones under control. Everybody's focused and engaged for this one which makes for a good listen especially when the sound is as clear as it is for this show. Nice playing by all the lads though Bobby's midi strumming on Saturday Night isn't to my taste. I like a more natural guitar sound. My only real complaint is that there's very little of Phil to be heard. He's playing his ass off too but you have to make an effort to hear him as he's too low in the mix. All in all though it's a good show from late in the game and well worth checking out.",

      "review_text": "Fun Show and Great Nude Drum Circle in \"campground\" For 1994, this was a really good show. Enjoyed a little mescalito and boogied with my mates. We all drove from Boulder and enjoyed the run. The \"campground\" was a massive concrete parking lot surrounded by chain-link. After this show we walked a few miles down to a Denny's to get some food. 1:00am and the place was full of locals. We sat next to a family of five whose average weight had to be close to 300 pounds and they were eating their dinner (1:00am!!)and massive desserts. Walked back to the campground and enjoyed a nude drum circle that had formed right next to my vehicle. Good times!",
