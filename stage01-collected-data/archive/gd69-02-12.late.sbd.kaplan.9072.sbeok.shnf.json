      "review_text": "What pace! The opening three songs (DS, St., 11) really offer everthing there is to get from a typical (which means GREAT!) '69 show.  To me, the essence of this show is in the 11.  This version just totally smokes.  The speed of the song is very reminiscent of a Caution or Viola Lee jam in that is starts out a bit slower then just goes faster and faster until you cannot believe how fast they are playing.  There are two ENORMOUS peaks in this version as well.  The first is just past the 7:00 minute mark.  JG is just on freaking fire.  His playing is so fast you can barely comprehend what he is playing (and I'm not sure he could if you could stop and ask him).  After this catharsis, there is a moment to catch your breath, but then we hit the 11:00 minute mark and, as if to prove you weren't imagining what you had heard earlier, they again stoke the fires as high as they will go.  This is truly one of \"the\" versions of the 11 in my opinion (along with 2/27/69 and 3/15/69).  The rest of the show, while still fantastic, seems a bit tired after the pace and energy unleashed during the Star->St.->11 sequence.  This a great companion to the Fillmore East 2/11/69 discs released a few years ago.  These discs prove just what the dead could do to blend speed, dexterity, emotion, and exploration into one of the most powerful \"hours\" of your life.  This one is not to be missed!! (Some slight oversaturation on the sound in places should not cause you any concern, its still sounds fantastic.)",

Then when a guitar player hits a note with the volume knob down and then rolls it up, it makes a very violin/cello sound. The combination of this with Weir and Phil gets us to what we hear.",
