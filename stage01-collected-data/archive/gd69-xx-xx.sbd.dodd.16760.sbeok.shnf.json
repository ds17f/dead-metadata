Which is still one of my top 5 if not my all-time favorite St. Stephen - perfection pure and simple.\n\nHell, these tracks may even warm up some that aren't too particular about the album; and if you dig the LP, this stuff is quite tasty for a take-out... it delivers the goods...  with so much live Dead available, it's ok to hear the band working out in the studio. \n\nAxo!",

Could check that out easily.  It'd be nice to know when they cut these tracks.  When I hear this stuff I see red velvet curtains, big candleabras, colored glass, dusty mirrors, storm clouds, and a dark figure wearing a cape at the edge of a cliff.",

The musical result was real fuzzy\" Also, this is what happens when they brought nitrous tanks into the studio,\"Stoned, stoned ...and truly lost themselves in the mix...the descent into total lunacy intitiated by mixing while inhaling nitrous majestically confused everything\"(pp.301 & 303) But it's without question the source of their greatest material. We are the beneficiaries of these psychonauts willing to explore the nether reaches of outer space always risking the possibility of never finding their way back and joining Major Tom in eternal weightless drift.",

The album was disastrously remixed in September 1971, and to my knowledge the original mix has never been commercially released. The differences between the original and remix are NOT subtle, and the original is much more rambunctious.\n\nWhat do people think of the ethicality of making available burns of the original mix free of charge to individuals who certify that they have a commercial copy of the remix? I have a VG copy of the album and a Linn LP12 turntable, Lyra Helikon cartridge, and M Audio Audiophile USB soundcard. I have made a very nice 24-bit/44.1kHz transfer that I could render at 16-bits for CD-player listening.\n\nI don't want to irk the Dead, who couldn't be more gracious, but since the original mix hasn't been sold for almost 35 years now, I can't see the harm in making it available in a friendly, low-key way. \n\nIf Live Music Archive would have reservations about this, it could be handled by FTP or mail. I'm a bit evangelical about the original mix, so I wouldn't mind a little trouble and expense in doing this. Let me know.",

There as no title on the LP, just a weird hand-drawn cover, he said. Because of this, I thought I would never find another copy of this to replace my worn out tape.... but here it is! WOW! Now, if someone could let me know where I can get a copy that I can download, not just a streaming copy.\n\n*edit*\n\nFirst, I would love a copy of the original Aoxomoxoa mix! :D\n\nSecond... I might get booted for this, but here goes.\n\nWant to download this?

The date given is just wrong though. By end of 69 the album in its finished commercial form had already been released. 1968 is probably meant and that might be a guestimate.",

DDB if always fun & you can hear Jerry having fun with it here....many of the tracks very basic & raw and what's wrong with that? \n\nIf you're into history & rarities & not set against studio stuff, definitely check this out.",

Other bonuses are Clementine Jam and Nobody's Spoonful Jam all from the same day. On a side note, the version that pounds in my head all the time was recorded 8/24/68 at the Shrine and is on Two from the Vault. Just incredible and the DeadLists guy didn't rank it(either doesn't own Two from or somehow ignored it even with the ultra-crisp remastering) but I believe it was answered that he never heard Two From because the version from 8/23/68 at the Shrine is among his \"Top 11 Elevens\". It's almost the same except the SBD off Two From the Vault is extreme High Quality and completely blows you away.",

      "review_text": "Brilliance This version of St. Stephen into The Eleven blow the official releases out of the water!  The use of what seem like bagpipes is genius!  They are a perfect thought for knowing that Stephen is going to progress to the William Tell bit which is performed in a traditional rhythm that would call for bagpipes let alone it definitely really sparked up the Eleven which, as some users here have pointed out, has some high octane electricity running through it.  Another useer has pointed out the telephone ring.  Brilliant move on the Dead's part!  That part alone should have never been cut from the official release it brings so much more coherency to this middle section of the song.  Really, when the phone rings and gets answered the telephone voice gives reason to the vocal effects, which again, are used the same way in the other songs on the album like rosemary and what's become of the baby.  When one thinks of this, if St. Stephen is the first track and the audience hears and acknowledges the telephone effect for the vocals then hears this again on rosemary and lets pretend the last track on WBOTB? (i know on the release its cosmic charlie but what if CC wasn't the last and we switched to WBOTB) there comes the realization of the album's coherency as one entity giving reason to the use of certain psychedelic effects.  Plus, the hammer hits on St. Stephen really provide a sharpness to the beat to balance and contrast with the slurring meandering of the bagpipes, which I'm sure they would have improved upon in practice for the final cuts.  I would have loved to have heard a final Aoxomoxoa where these versions of Stephen>11>Barbed Wire and the rest would have made it on.  Even the untitled instrumental is pretty awesome given that it would have really fit immediately after That Rag.  I always thought the original mixing of this album was better than the remix but now I love these takes way more than even those!  I wish they would have kept these for the final because the band was definitely onto something that in my opinion would have made Earthquake Country one of the biggest and best psychedelic albums of all time alongside or over taking Dark Side.  Not to say that Aoxomoxoa isn't one of the best but simply put...better than what we all know it today.  If these cuts would have made it on I would love to hear what people would think the track listing order should have been.  Lastly, on Mountains of the Moon, the non overdubbed guitar and vocals, if you crank up the volume there is that harpsichord playing faintly in the background at the beginning of the song where it would normally come in on the final release version.",

When I downloaded this version several years ago I had to fix \"What's Become of the Baby\" because I recall a serious flaw in it -- it gets set back about 1:30 near the middle -- listen closely and you'll notice that Jerry's repeating himself. I don't know if this is because two different versions were stitched together badly or what, but my repaired version only runs 7 minutes and 20 seconds, compared with 8 minutes and 40-some here.  Let's face it, this is damn funny if nobody's commented on this or even noticed it yet.",

      "review_text": ". . . but where is the child that plays with the sunshines ? This is truly mind altering stuff !! My brain still oozes out of my ears each time listening to this chewy, sticky goodness. Were they ever better at their psychedelic prime? I think not ! Their creative zenith! There would be other stellar moments for sure, but none with such laser focus, quantum speed, and numberless quantity ! 1969 was arguably, their most productive year. \n\n I agree with Mr. Sun below, the way this album was truly meant to be heard, before all the redubs and heavy-handed mixing etc. I mean, the telephone during Stephen ? Just fricking monster ! Every version here blows away the album IMO. Theres like a watery quality about China that when looking up in a dream light wind, one can see the Aurora Borealis in the midnight sun. Rosemary, Charley, Mountains ? Epic! The moment in track 10 @ 4:01 when someone exclaims 'ahhshit' as though a mistake ? It's perfect ! A beautiful moment in time, captured forever for us all to enjoy. Everything they wanted to say encapsulated  in one neat package ! This is my church regularly ~\n\n Happy  2013",
