High points in set one are Bob going crazy with the slide guitar on Little Red Rooster and Brent burning it up on All Over Now. The second set is extremely good, with Brent on organ for Scarlet>Fire and Phil dropping bombs left and right, especially at the close of Truckin' and in Morning Dew. The only real drawback to this show is that Jerry's guitar is mixed a little low in the first set. The energy and explosiveness of the show, however, make up for any shortcomings. This second set, while not flawless, will most likely end up in your top 10 for the Brent years. Get it now!",

And just when you think it can't continue, he takes a pause and lets rip again for a long, long time. This solo is one of the most impeccable bits of playing I've ever heard. This goes into a great transition into a thumping Phil intro to a classis period Fire on the Mountain.  The whole 2nd set its incredible.",

      "review_text": "A History Lesson Why this is one of the greatest shows ever.  Following a story I wrote in 1982 about that show, written for Deadheads and non-Deadheads.  A small segment was printed in the book \"Skelaton Key\".\n\nGlen\nglengoldstein@mindspring.com\n\n\n\"Bay Gulls!\"\n\n\"Boulder B-a-a-a-y gulls.\"\n\nIt was Lenny.  Of course.  Moaning about bagels.  In a chipped-rock and gravel parking lot outside of Austin, Texas.  Wearing a skirt.\n\nLenny had been at the Grateful Dead concert two nights ago at the Red Rocks Amphitheater outside of Boulder, Colorado along with Mark, Peter Lemonjello, me, and 10,000 other crazed bozos. \n\nBut only a few of those had decided to take the long drive down to Texas -- 900 miles -- to see just one Dead show near Austin before the band swung straight back north for a show the following day in Oklahoma City, on lead guitarist Jerry Garcia's birthday.  The Grateful Dead play a completely different rock show every night, and a lot of folks look for clues, like Jerry's birthday, to help them pick which shows will be the hot ones.  \n\nI went to Texas because Mark had called this one.  Most concert tickets nowadays come from big computerized ticket companies -- Ticketron or Teletron -- and all the tickets look alike; printed on computer paper by machines in shopping malls across the country.  A ticket to the baseball game looks no different than a ticket to the Rolling Stones.  But Mark had gotten a look at the special mail-order tickets for the Austin show (actually Manor Downs, Texas) and they sparkled.  No really; the tickets were impregnated with little specks of silver sparkle, probably to make them harder to counterfeit, but Mark saw it as an omen.\n\n\"Look, over the years we've gone through hundreds of different theories on how to pick the hot shows,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 Mark said.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Saturdays.  Favorite concert halls.  Cities where they played a hot show last year.  Outdoor shows.  We're never right.  I'm averaging only one out of every 15 shows that I pick being the amazing performance that makes my jaw drop; that makes me scratch my head for weeks afterwards saying, 'What was that!'  \n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Maybe the quintessential statement on Dead shows came from this guy I saw talking to an usher in Chicago.  He said, 'I've seen the Grateful Dead 53 times.  And 52 times they've let me down.  But once they were GREAT!'  So I don\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t know.  But there are just two things I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m sure of: the Dead never play the really big show two nights in a row, and they always blow the big ones.  Woodstock -- a disaster for the Dead.  New Year\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s last year -- ditto, ditto.  I figure that they'll screw up Jerry's birthday in Oklahoma City big time, but they'll be so excited the day before his birthday in Texas that they'll peak too soon and cook.  You have to trust me on this one.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\n\nHow could you argue with logic like that?  I got in the car.  It was the easiest 900 miles I ever drove...because Mark did the driving himself in an all-night frenzy.  I went to sleep, I woke up in the back seat of my Corolla, I was in Texas.  At a Dunkin' Donuts, where Peter Lemonjello was exchanging testy words with some locals over the length of his hair (yes, even today, in the early '80s.)  Peter's not a fighter, and neither were the rest of us, so we hustled him back into the car and continued on.\n\nI don't know how Lenny got down to Texas, with the bag full of bagels from a Boulder bakery he was trying to sell in the parking lot.  Lenny lived in a convoluted world of cars where he stored his backpack during each night's concert and friends of friends houses or cheap motel rooms where he crashed after the show.  In the morning there would be roundabout negotiations over who could fit in which beat up van or VW for a ride to that night's concert while a dozen Deadheads lay around rolling joints and watching re-runs of The Love Boat and the motel manager kept calling to say that it was past check-out time.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Oh yeah.  We were just leaving.  Or something.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2  Click.\n\nBut there was Lenny, in Texas, looking exceptionally world-weary and wise for a 22-year old.  Matted hair.  Lots of necklaces of hand-strung beads, each with a too-long story behind it.  A vest.  A poncho too.  Innumerable bells and sashes.  No shoes.  (\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2I lost them after the Penn State show.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2  How could anyone lose their shoes?)  And the skirt.  Not a feminine skirt particularly; more like an African tribesman might wear.  An African tribesman who spent a lot of time in Berkeley, anyway.\n\nOr Santa Cruz, for that matter.  Lenny was definitely on the circuit then.  There was an unofficial, unnamed circuit of cool places to hang out.  Boulder; Santa Cruz; Eugene, Oregon; Ann Arbor; Yellow Springs, Ohio (Antioch College ); Boston...You could hitchhike from one to the other and always find a place to crash.  Then you went home to Long Island and asked your parents for more money before hitting the road again.\n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Lenny!

His eyes were a little glassy and focused on some distant land, but in a kind way his look said, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ve seen things that are so incredibly beautiful and full of magic.  If only I could tell you all about them but, well, you know how it is...

Maybe you should get off the tour; I mean for awhile, anyway.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\n\nLenny\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s problems were serious, no doubt, and getting off the tour probably was a good idea.  But there I was -- unemployed, dropped out of my second college and trying desperately to select a third one, living at home with my divorced father in the Jersey suburbs, completely miserable with my life -- and I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m telling Lenny how he should be living his life!  \n\nFor all of Lenny\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s problems, when you got down to it Lenny was dancing barefoot in the sunshine everyday, seeing the country, hanging out with kind, loving, people (including many wonderful women) and seeing what at that time I considered to be the finest popular musicians of our day, and I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m going to tell him how to live his life!  Which one of us was crazier!  Lenny was \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ruining\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 his life, but having a stupendous time doing it.  I was trying harder than ever to act like a responsible adult, and I was not happy.\n\nLenny saw some people he knew from some show and I snuck off.  I met up with Mark and Peter Lemonjello and we walked back to my car to get ready for the show.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d lost so much stuff over the years at Dead shows that I learned to strip down to the bare essentials before I went in: car keys, a 10 dollar bill for emergencies, and one piece of photo I.D. (in case they found me wandering through the Mojave with a silly grin on my face).  As I emptied all the other crap and lint out of my pockets, I found the liquid bottle.\n\nAt least I thought; no, I knew it was a liquid bottle.  LSD comes in several forms -- little squares of paper blotter acid, microdots that look like the miniature fluoride \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2tooth pills\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 I took as a kid... but the feature flavor on tour this summer was colorless, odorless, liquid; served up and sold from little plastic eyedrop bottles for $3 a drop, or two drops for $5.  (\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Two for five,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 people mumbled as they wandered through the crowd, discreetly selling doses, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Two for five.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2)  \n\nI\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d found the liquid bottle on the ground after the Red Rocks show.  Now I held it up to the fading sunlight.  Empty?  Or just one or two drops left?  Hard to tell.  I gave it a jiggle and looked again.  There didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t seem to be anything left.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d heard that if you rinsed an \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2empty\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 liquid bottle out with water and drank the water, there would be one good dose left in the bottle. \n\nMark handed me a Mickey Malt, a beer best known for coming in a squat green bottle with a wide mouth the size of a half dollar.  I snapped the liquid bottle in two, dropped both pieces right into my Mickey Malt, and gave it all a swirl.  I drank it as we walked toward the show.\n\nOn the way we passed a car, neatly parked on the shoulder of the road between all the other cars, in a huge ball of flame.  We heard the fire engines coming from down the highway, weaving their way slowly through crowds of concert goers.  Some people watched the car burn, but most just shrugged and walked by.  In this crew you learned to expect a lot of weird stuff, and a burning car didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t seem that unusual compared to a lot of the other adventures these folks had been on recently.  \n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Whoa.  Can you imagine coming out of the show, so high, and finding your car melted into the ground?\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 said Mark.  I thought to myself that there are only a few really interesting stories that start off, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Once we were so high...\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 but having your car turn into a puddle while you were at a Dead show was probably right up there.\n\nWe kept walking.  I didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t feel any effects from the liquid LSD.  Maybe the bottle had been empty after all.\n\nManor Downs was as I had remembered it from a year ago; a horse racing track, with the concert held on the soft grass of the infield.  A few hard-core Deadheads in tie-dye shirts and drawstring pants, me in my traditional shorts and lightweight backpacking shirt.  Many swillfully drunk locals with white T-shirts and Harley or Budweiser belt buckles.  Most concert sites won\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t even sell cups of beer anymore; Manor Downs sells full cases of canned Red White & Blue beer to the crowd.  I walked around with a big smile and shuffled through the grass.  It was still warm out and the air smelled sweet.  What a nice change from the usual hockey rinks and college auditoriums where most of the shows take place.  I took off my shoes so I could feel the cool cool grass.  \n\nMark had called this one.  It was the show.  Every note glided into place, rolling in like a warm breeze.  Phil, the bass player, stepped way out in front and pushed the band along.  The bass is usually lost in the cavernous girders of the big halls, where Phil looks bored; spending the show with his back to the crowd, peering over the top of his wire-rim glasses, twiddling the knobs on his equipment, and talking to the oscilloscope he\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s had installed in his rack of gear.  I think Phil realized that this show was one of the few opportunities all year for us to be able to hear him clearly.  \n\nI stood there with my mouth hanging open, and was nudged by a local Texan.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2When Phil\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s in the driver\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s seat...ya got nothin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 t\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 worry about,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 he said solemnly.  I nodded.  Phil dug in deeper, and I heard a loud crackle followed by a buzz as the sound system peaked-out from the overload .  The sound crew writhed around on the stage floor with their little flashlights, re-plugging equipment and flipping circuit breakers as quick as they could.  Phil didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t let up.  The crew looked wide-eyed and frantic.  I smacked my forehead with my palm.\n\nI realized that I was high.  Very high.  The liquid bottle rinse had worked, finally.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d given up on it after the first hour passed without feeling anything.  Now, somewhere in the back of my mind, I was really glad that I was in the familiar environment of a Dead show, where I had tripped so many times before, because in any other setting I probably would have been too high to deal.  At a Dead show, no matter how high you are, you can be pretty sure that someone near you is even higher.  A good place to be when you\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2re floating free.\n\nThe Dead\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s second set is for the most part one big improvisational jam that flows in and out and around their standard songs.  Jerry eased the band through its jam toward the Dead\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s only big commercial hit, Truckin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2.  \n\nI was disappointed.  They had tried the song just two nights earlier at Red Rocks, and it had been a disaster -- they were out of tune and they missed the big crescendo that comes after the guitar solo.  With a repertoire as vast as the Dead\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s it seemed awful soon to be trying the same tune again.\n\nThe band started to launch into Truckin', but Jerry didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t seem to like the way it was being done, so he pulled back, like an old man carefully playing a trout with a wispy fly fishing pole.  They played through the bars of the jam and came around again.  But again it wasn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t what Jerry had in mind, and again he steered everyone off.  This all with no verbal communication between the band members, just a lot of raised eyebrows and smiles.  Jerry seemed to say to rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2No, youngster, not quite.

After the embarrassment of botching this old chestnut so badly just two nights earlier, Jerry was revisiting the scene of the crime as a reminder to himself on his birthday (it\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s past midnight!  It\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s birthday now!) that he still had it; a 42-year old rocker, hammering each individual note in its place without hesitation.  The rest of the band worked to keep up.  He was unrelenting.  As the crescendo built I involuntarily took a small step backward and braced myself on my rear foot.  Jerry stopped on a dime, lifted his guitar neck just a bit higher, and sent the peak crashing down on us in a searing bolt.  My whole body lit up.  And without missing a beat he came around again, and hit the same crescendo for a second time, just to make sure.  Jerry was all smiles.  How could the same band that had played the same song so poorly just two nights earlier pull this off?  \n\nI wandered back to the car, barefoot.  I had lost my shoes at the show.  Well not lost; I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d tied them to a railing and someone had stolen them.  Somewhere in Texas someone is daring to run around the redneck bars in a pair of bright purple Converse high-tops.\n\nI ran into Lenny as I was walking along.\n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2So.

Nice to see them again, but...\n\nI made my way back to the car.  Folks had obviously availed themselves earlier of the fireworks stands that were set up near the show, and the parking lot was now ablaze with rockets being launched horizontally.  Five fast fireballs from a roman candle shot past my ankles as I hunted for my car.\n\nPeter Lemonjello and Mark and I leaned against the cool metal car doors.  We all knew what had happened, and that it was indescribable, but we ranted and raved about it anyway.\n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2It was the show!\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 Mark said.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2It was the best show!

Not much talking really: \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Yup.

We stood around in silence, just watching the bugs slowly glide by our eyes under the lights at the pumps.\n\nWe decided to call our friends back in Boulder and tell them not to bother driving to Oklahoma City.  We knew the band was probably going to be awful tomorrow night, on \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s birthday\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2.  Mark was right twice; this was the night, and they never play the big show two nights in a row.  \n\nBesides, it was all in the math: the Dead had played late tonight for the first time in ages, and it was now 1:30 a.m.  The band was probably going to go back to the hotel, snort coke until dawn to celebrate Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s birthday and surviving to rock in their old age and stuff, and then try in vain to sleep.  You know that feeling after you do too much coke, where your head feels much too heavy for your neck... but there\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s nowhere else to put it?  Yeah.  The show in Oklahoma was scheduled for 2 p.m.  The band would never be able to pull themselves together in time.  A disaster just waiting to happen when the sun came up.\n\nMark came back from the phone.  Our friends had already left the house for Oklahoma City.  It was like those old horror movies -- we tried to save our loved ones in Boulder, but it was too late, they couldn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t be stopped, and now they were doomed.\n\nDriving all night with a head full of LSD isn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t as dangerous as it sounds.  Now I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m not recommending that everyone dose just before they get behind the wheel, but I will say that by the time the concert ends the peak has come and gone.  (Unless you\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2re a big gambler like my old friend Glenn Hirsch, who would still be popping 12 hours worth of LSD tabs in his mouth three-quarters of the way through the show.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m going to dose until I get it right,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 Glenn told me once.)  \n\nANYWAY... by the time you start driving after the show what you\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2re left with is an inability to sleep (perfect for all-night driving) and an absurd attention to detail.  LSD makes every moment seem to last an hour, and there\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s not a whole lot that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s going to escape your attention.  You can watch a car passing you and notice everything from the design of its headlights in your rear-view mirror as it approaches to the name of the car dealer on the trunk lid as it pulls ahead.  Of course, the important part is to remember to watch the road too, instead of concentrating intently on the fact that on the car speeding next to you all of the door rivets are in perfectly parallel lines.\n\nAll this is fine, as long as the tape player cranks and there are friends to jabber with.  But once the car falls silent, a young feller like me with a head full of acid can get awfully introspective.  And that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s when I forget that my thoughts are being temporarily piloted by a very powerful drug.\n\nAnd it was coincidentally LSD that I started to think about.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d had a really great time tripping at the show.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d caught just the right amount of acid for the one really hot show of the tour.  \n\nI guess.  \n\nI\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ve always said that there\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s no such thing as a correct dose of acid; if things are going good, you always wish you\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d done a little bit more.

Thinking back, I realized that at the start of the second set, I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d been just a little too high.  My thoughts were racing so fast that the band was halfway into the opening tune before I realized that they\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d started playing again.  (Or course, with an outdoor show there was no dimming of the house lights to clue me in.)  I just remembered staring at the beautiful stars and walking through the cool summer night air and suddenly thinking, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2I hear something.  Scarlet Begonias, one of my favorite songs!

And had a great time of it too, but I would have \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2missed\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 the show.\n\nLike I said, there must have been a pretty potent dose left in that liquid bottle I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d dropped in my Mickey Malt.  But what made me so damn sure that it was a liquid LSD bottle?  Of course it was; there\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s only one thing in the whole world that comes in that type of dropper.

Was I going to spend the rest of my life like that, sucking down anything that fell in my path?  Despite all the old folk tales, they\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ve never really found anything wrong with LSD -- no, not chromosome damage, and only those who are already mentally unstable tend to jump out of windows or try to stop speeding trains with their hands.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2The number one rule for taking LSD:\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 Mark always said, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Maintain a firm grasp of the obvious.

And anything that powerful must be doing something to my system.  I wanted to make sure that I had enough brain cells left, just in case I ever wanted to be able to go to the corner for a newspaper.  Was I going to be a loser for life?  Like Jerry sang in Wharf Rat, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2I know that the life...

Everyone else in the car was jolted from their hallucinations.  \n\nI pulled into a rest area on the highway.  It had to be 4 a.m., and we were about 100 miles from Manor Downs, but the parking lot was filled with Deadheads, dancing, listening to tape players, playing Frisbee.  I got out of the car and tried to walk naturally toward the bathroom.  A tired looking trucker was coming down the sidewalk toward me.  What did he make of this carnival, sprung up in the middle of the night on I-35?  If he noticed, he pretended not to, and shuffled off toward the cab of his truck.\n\nWhen I came out I saw that while some folks were going to party all night, a few had started laying out sleeping bags right on the asphalt, or even setting up tents on the small grassy median strips.  I tried to sleep, enjoyed the show of swirling stars overhead, and worried about what was going to become of me.\n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\n\nIn the morning we were pulling in to Oklahoma City when we saw one of the Dead\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s trucks barrel by us.

The band probably took a plane, but somehow I thought the Kwipment Krew would be there already.

The show was being pushed back to 4 p.m.  Yeah right!  The band was probably still crashed out at the Austin Hilton.  \n\nAt 5 p.m. -- three hours late -- the band took the stage on the verge of death.  Jerry looked fresh from the intensive care ward; pale white and nervous, hiding behind his usual dark glasses and black T-shirt.  Phil wasn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t even wearing his wire rim glasses; maybe he couldn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t bear to watch the upcoming tragedy except as a bad blur.  He came on stage with his hair soaking wet, rubbing it with a towel, and looking at us with bewilderment; wondering how we had all gotten into the living room just outside his shower.  Bill the drummer was taking deep breaths from an oxygen mask he held to his face.  No, really!  OK, maybe it was nitrous oxide, not oxygen, but if so, that didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t make me feel any better.\n\nWe walked right to the front and wrapped our fingers around the chain link fence.  (What an amateur crowd!  If you tried that in Rochester, you\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d be smothered to death!)  Jerry was carefully stepping his way through the bands easiest first-set songs.  We elbowed each other and guessed most of the songs -- Hmm, what can they play next that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s not too loud, has only a few chords, and they know by heart from playing for years.  Yup.\n\nMeantime the locals next to us on the fence were going berserk.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Jerry!  JERRY!  LOOK!

One of those one-pan cakes that comes in a box of mix with its own little aluminum foil pan.  Scary.  He must have been able to hear them, but he pretended not to notice.\n\nIt got worse.  In between songs, the entire crowd sang, \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Happy Birthday,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 to Jerry.

Just re-re-tuned his guitar, then leaned over the top of his amp where lines of magic white powder were waiting for his nose.\n\nIntermission came not a moment too soon.  We walked around and wished it were all over.  Like watching a cheesy horror film, it loses its attraction fast, and you sort of know how it\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s going to end.\n\n\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2Watch,\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 I said.  \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2They\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2ll open the second set with the world\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s lamest Iko Iko, since it\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s sort of a special song, but it\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s really easy to play, and everyone who drove out from Boulder will think that they saw something great.\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\n\nYup.\n\nBut I shouldn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t sound so disappointed.

Anyway, I have always thought that this is one of the finest Scarlet/Fires I have ever heard. The famous 5-7-77 is of course on everyone's list, but the way Brent punches the keys at the Fire intro still gives me chills. You can hear them hesitate, hesitate, not yet, and Wham. Phil thunks in, and Brent...yeah! And then the Dew. My tape has the end cut just at the end, which has killed me(especially seeing there is room left on the tape), and to have this in its entirety makes my day.

It always reminds me of how much difference he made to this band. Man I would have loved to see him and Pig together. I still like this shows Little Red Rooster the best.

We never could find the 1st set. It didn't matter. My tape was probaby the 92nd generation, and I had many other bootlegs where the sound quality was much, much better, but I didn't care. The 2nd set is incredible. My favorite set of all time. Scarlet->Fire->Estimate->Eyes. Wow. Wow. Wow. I played it to death for years. Probably played it at least once a day for a year or two. When it got to end of side A, I wouldn't listen to drums or space or Uncle Johns. I would wait impatiently for my tape to rewind so I could listen to S->F->E->E again. Now I find this soundboard issue, and my world has been rocked. I hear things I never heard before on that old tape: I can actually hear Brent shine through...and while I love Phil, there are no longer those parts where he hits those certain notes and drowns out everybody else for 1-2 seconds because of the taper mics. This is a true gem.",

Yeah, I like objective reviews of the music, but my god, I think it's incredibly awesome to have experiences like that right next to the shows.  Yeah it took me half an hour to read, but it was awesome and really showed one peron's experience, with the expectations, the actual show, and post show feelings.  I wish we had alot more long reviews like that.  I felt like I was there, and considering that one and a half at the time, this is all I've got.\n\nGreat review dude.",

      "review_text": "Don't know why this is a good show Can't rate this one high.  First, not a great soundboard, there is little base and it's very hard to hear Weir when he's not aforementioned in the music (a.k.a. Little Red Rooster).\n\nMore importantly, the first set and Scarlet > Fire is uninspired and boring.  Brown Eyed Women and Deal are flubbed songs, and I don't like the quick acting lyrical work in Little Red Rooster.  And Weir's slide guitar covers about 6 different notes the entire time, and he just trills over them for about a minute.  It's so obvious when a solo is Garcia or Weir.\n\nScarlet Fire just humms along after the lyrics and Jerry simply plucks notes here and there.  Fire is on the slower side of things and not all that interesting.  I've have about 40 Scarlet/Fires and this one ranks near the very bottom.\n\nEyes is uplifting, but age and drugs are really affecting Jerry at this point.  He is missing guitar notes and he can't play every note with the same intensity and volume.  A due criticism for every concert after about this period of time.\n\nThis one is not worth the download IMO and I'm looking for other good concerts from 1981, that are or superior quality and music.",

      "review_text": "Roll them Laughing Bones This is one of those shows that:\n\n(a) stands out despite being sandwiched into an incredible about two and a half week run for the band (and an equally intense and ON year)\n\n(b) never fails to make me smile, make the hairs on my arms and neck stand up many times over\n\n(c) will always have the power to bring me out of a bad day/place and deliver me to a musical nirvana.  Sincerely.\n\n(d) will be a top choice when I turn others onto the Dead\n\nWhy?  Well, the show has a lot of things I love about the Dead, in varying degrees.  The earnest and declarative Candyman really shows the band's softer, folkish-bluesy side.  The Bird Song is floaty, yet steady, interstellar and yet down to earth.  All Over Now ROCKS!  Ramble, Brown Eyed and Music Never all have massive appeal and hit on that \"Greatest Band in the Land\" kind of Americana vibe...the thing that caught my attention first with the Dead.\n\nSet II, well, just listen if you aren't already a fan.  Excepting a few audio blips in the recording itself, this is a Dead tour-de-force and features one of my fave Scarlet-Fires and Dews, as well.  Simply delightful set.  And despite being mixed in with the brilliance of 8-3, 8-7, 8-8 and Red Rocks run prior, it still stands out.  Not better, just stands out.  (Btw, from this year, it is hard to find a truly bad show...maybe a few \"not so greats\" but this is an amazingly consistent and kick-a$$ year!)\n\nEnjoy!",

      "review_text": "High grade show It was always a pretty safe bet that if the tape of the 1st set circulated, you know that it is a pretty darn good ahow.  I will always know this show as being one of my first ever 1st set tapes.  I found out quickly why it was circulating on its own.  Great 1st set with solid song selections and overall execution, And it doesn't stop there as the 2nd set is even better.\n\nThe S>F here lives up to the hype. Listen to the first solo in Fire. It almost sounds like another guitar player picks up in the solo immediately after the first phrasing. That shows to me how well Jerry changed his effect, and it is al\u00e1o tangible proof of how ON he was this night.  The rest of the band follows suit and is ON as well!  Brent's playing and harmonies are fantastic.  I like his sound choices in 81/82 in particular. Phil is dominate throughout and leads the band, Bobby rolls and adds a lot and then the drummers are great as they were all of '82. Listen in to Don't Ease, as I am sure you will be able to picture Jerry's smile by the sounds of his singing.\n\nThis is a 4.5 star show listed here as a 4.",
