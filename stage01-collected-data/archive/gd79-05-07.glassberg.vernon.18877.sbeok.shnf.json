      "review_text": "A solid show from top to bottom Evidently, this show comes highly recommended so I'm looking forward to listening to a stream of a noticeably higher quality than the previous two shows. \n\n1st Set: Well, the crowd is certainly pumped to see their heroes... They're clapping too fast for this perky \"Ease.\" Keeping it loose and easy to glide our feet is an \"Uncle.\" \"River's\" got a longer intro than usual keeping us tensely anticipating their vocal intro to the song. This pumps the crowd up into a nice frenzy... Mydland's solo displays an effort to be creative, but is too thoughtful to match the energy put up during these opening tunes. \"Candyman\" is fine. Again this recording does not allow for Jerry's vocal projection to stand out as something beautiful, or it may just be J' voice. \"LLR\" is standard but not overwhelmingly pretty that I'm begging the Lord to shed some tears. Yea yea yea,  smart to tell this KY crowd that you'd rather be nowhere else but TN. For an older \"Minglewood\" this one is enjoyably sloshy. \"Peggy\" is serious and thoughtful. Things get pumped back up with a \"Passenger.\" Ummm..was that really the set closer?!  Nahhhh...we needed a 'Deal' to close a very fine set off properly.\n\n2nd Set: Whoooo!!  Shake me down! Of course there's more clapping, silly... This version is dance-happy... Oh my, I don't think I've ever heard of a show where \"Jack\" followed a \"Shakedown\" Good version with a unified buildup, everyone's clapping along... Ahhhh.. now pour the soul-refreshing \"Estimated\" down my throat... Brent's playing an odd synth that sounds like a cheesy late 70s church organ... it does interefere with my enjoyment; tho, the band's having a good time playing. \"Eyes\" emerges from a hard-working \"Estimated jam... it's speedy tho tight... \"Drums\" is a very generous length tonight, tho \"Space\" is not particularly otherworldy. Quickly, we get on a more linear path, marching towards our \"NFA\" destination. At first it's rather standard, but at 8:00 the instruments develop this clanging distortion that makes this version sound more punkish than the norm. \"Black\" is a nice stand-out cause of the slow-burning rocking outro...the rest is  comfortable groove. It segues well into an immediately picking up the pace \"Around.\" It's loud and raucous, everything an ideal Berry closer should be. It's hot, hot hot, but feels rushed and shorter than it ideally should be. \n\n\"US\" does its job righteously ending this above-average 3 1/2 star show.",

I caled some friends, and the next thing I knew, I was assigned to get 10 tickets.  Although only 4 were allowed per person, I was lucky to find some friends on the line to get me a couple more.\nMaybe it was the high of being @ my first show, maybe it was the beautiful spring night, maybe it was the roses.  But, it was a magical evening, and I can verify that this show is a really hot one now that I've gotten the chance to hear it more than 26 years! after the scene of the crime.",

      "review_text": "TO BE RELEASED !!!!!!!! Barry Glassberg, once again, did a phenomenal job recording this show...in front of the soundboard where the acoustics, ambiance, and exquisitely bold details excel without excessive echo. I walked out of this show amazed after hearing not one of my favorite songs, Eyes of the World, performed with such vitality, skill, and urgency, you must know the Boys were hitting on all 25 cylinders, for this is the quintessential version! All of my old criticism about EOTW being too: simple, corny, hokey, boring, ponderous, repetitive, and long winded went by the wayside this special night.  Accordingly, Phil Lesh and Friends, during the summer '02 tour in N.J., also did it in an upbeat double speed rhumba style too. The Grateful Dead were obviously revitalized by the following: their trip to Egypt in 9/78, both Keith and Donna Godcheaux leaving the band [addition by way of subtraction], and the multi-colored keyboards of all types which generated old, new, fresh, and modern sounds, energy, and the on-key vital vocal harmonies of Brent Mydland. Garcia's voice also recovered from a rough Fall & Winter of '78. Gone are the overly sweet, feminine, slow, and careful down lullaby vibes of the '76 reunion tour. Lesh was starting to sing more often and became more extroverted again. Weir's Lost Sailor was a compelling mystical trip, which took off in'79 as well. The evolution of the double drumming and their ever expanding world wide drum set up metamorphisized into...a complex beast.  John Cipollina's under rated and overlooked eye popping spine tingling biting guitar leads on Not Fade Away are also unparalled. The space-feedback was also reborn, as illustated by the group mindset. You must be both careful and prudent with your gas pedal while driving with this tape on. This show is the perfect antidote for any depression. A renaissance or new peak was consistent from ALL members regarding: cohesiveness, common goals, effort, energy, enthusiasm, intensity, being upbeat,and everyone supporting eachother, which lasted approximately 2 years. Please see Jack Straw, Staggerlee, and China Cat Sunlower-Jam-I know you Rider in Binghampton, N.Y. 5/9/79 and the entire 2nd set of Cape Cod, MA. 10/27/79. The aforementioned shows easily blow away the overrated Cornell, N.Y. 5/6/77 show and must must must f*ckin' be released by GDP. Speaking of John Cipollina, his former Quicksilver band mate Nicky Hopkins must get his due too. The mysteriously omitted masterpiece, Let's Spend The Night Together-Jam-Edward The Mad Shirtgrinder by the Jerry Garcia/ Nicky Hopkins Band in the Fall of '75, all of which is very conspicuous in its absence from each and every one of the Jerry Garcia solo releases. Nicky Hopkins was the most underrated electrifying piano player I have ever seen. He was a mad man, who both recorded and went on tour with The: Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks, Jeff Beck, Steve Miller, Quicksilver, Jefferson Airplane, etc. Thanks, Steve L. Brejensky, ESQ.    ***  P.S. Go see the N.Y. Beatle's cover band, The Fab Faux, who do every song the Beatle's never did live with all of the appropriate instruments for all of the songs. Love with Arthur Lee many personnas is free and revialized. The Jefferson Starship, joined by ex-Quicksilver member David Freiberg, Country Joe McDonald, and Tom Constanten is still amazing, as if the overly ''Slick'' '78-'88 big hair greasy hearted Reagan era was an aberration that never existed. Like grandma used to say:...I should live so...\"  ENJOY!!!",

      "review_text": "Incredible recording Lafayette College is my alma matter, so this show has always held a certain amount of curiousity to me.  I attended in the late 80s, and the \"best\" act I can remember to ever play on campus while I was there was the Bangles, in late '88.  So this show must have been a real treat.  I can remember perusing an old yearbook as a freshman and seeing a writeup about this show, with pictures, etc.  It always surprised me that the stuffy administration at Lafayette would ever go along with hosting a concert like this.\n\nAnyway, I tried for some time to track down a copy of this show, and it just didn't seem to be in too many collections.  Thanks to LAMA, I was finally able to download a copy here.\n\nKirby Fieldhouse is not a \"tiny\" gym, as one poster noted below.  It was designed to host indoor track & field events, so it's a pretty big building.  (Graduation ceremonies have been held there on rainy days, so again, it isn't small).  I'd guess with the floor opened up, you could fit 3,000 in there.  So while definitely not the biggest venue the Dead played, there's plenty of room to really air out the sound. \n\nThis recording has perfect ambiance, with a fantastic mix.  It sounds like the taper was in just the right place to capture a really clear mix, with just the right balance of crowd for us to hear the energy at this show.  Brent's vocals are a bit low in the mix, and it's a bit hard to hear him at times.  \"Passenger\" really stands out to me on this recording -- the band was really cooking for this one.  \n\nAs others have noted, this is well worth your time and bandwidth to download.  Without a question, the best concert Lafayette College ever hosted!",

      "review_text": "I Never Knew It Was This Good!!! I was a sophomore at Lafayette College when I attended this, my first, Dead show. I had been getting very familiar with their music for the previous 2 years, but this was (at the time)a little bit of a disappointment to me. The problem was I was way in back, too chicken/paranoid to work my way to the front, and the acoustics of the hall weren't very good. Plus I was disappointed that Keith and Donna weren't with them any more. It was General Admission and a madhouse when they finally opened the doors. I think the big metal doors got ripped off their hinges in fact! The last time Lafayette got anyone of this magnitude, I'm sure! Anyway, hearing it now at this quality of a recording is unbelieveable! I had no idea that it was such a great show......and I was there! (No comment on the state of consciousness at the time!)This is a real treat for me. I especially like to note Jerry's kind of jazzy solo on Candyman. This is wonderful!",

They kinda go through the motions. But then the second set comes out and sends the rocket ship off to mars. A fine Estimated paves the way for a killer Eyes - see the other reviews. The Not Fade Away with John Cipollina is a top 10 for sure. Long and jammed out, the kind of jam that will take you up to the 13th heaven.

The band was so tight and they played there asses off all night! I remember \"Shakedown\" and \"Eyes\" being exceptional!  Everything was perfect including the crowd. I lost the people that drove me and being so high I figured I was really screwed being in the middle of PA with no car. No cell phones back then either.

It got me hooked, and I'd end up at close to 80 ea Dead Shows as well as another almost 80 Jerry shows.  This was ten minutes from my house, and for sure got me off running, as Radio City, tours, New Years and more followed.\nFlash forward and I'm still at it, 6 dead and co shows this summer. It's not the same, it's different.  Phish is around and that's the closest feel for me as touring with the dead was.

His delicate (Roland?) keys in Peggy-O leave an open space that Phil and Jerry can interweave around creating the warm warp and woof that was the early-Brent-era sound.\n\nJerry's and Phil's new Irwin guitars, the Meyer sound system upgrade, Bobby's open chops on the pearl-inlay Ibanez, the rock solid Rhythm Devils, and the introduction of Brent birth a new sound and new life for the Dead. It's all audible in the Peggy-O, and it's sweet as can be.\n\nI love this era and am jealous of all attendees.
