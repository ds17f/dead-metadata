This show is a knockout considering the sloppiness of 1995. The last of what made The Dead what they were.",

Maybe he knew it was his last?  At least, he played as if it was.  In fact, for 95, Jerry's pretty good.  He has more energy here than you hear on a lot of 95 stuff.  This gets 4 stars for the awesome Dew and overall quality of recording.  Oh, and Jerry *almost* makes it through U.S. Blues without blowing all the words, so you know it ain't too bad.  I would say U.S. Blues and Bertha are two songs that I always say, \"Why even play it if you're going to blow the words EVERY time?\"",

This is NOT a good show at all. Below average '95 show with Jerry on poor form all night. Don't get me wrong, I am usually the most forgiving listener when '95 shows are concerned but this is probably one of the worst I have heard, to the point it brought me down. The recording is good sound quality indeed for an AUD, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired, even for this late date. Approach with caution!  \n\nPlease people, rate these shows on how the recordings sound, rather than on how good a time you had at them. Otherwise you get folks like me wasting half a day downloading something they didn't really want to hear.",

It was very strange to just see him stand there\nwith his back to the crowd, noodling for that period of time. People were puzzled by his presence. It was like turning the lights on in the fun house. I think the band dug Albany alot and these last 2 were definately proof of it. 6/21, My last show, wonderful but, shaky sets, flubbed Scarlet verses and all... goes to show, you don't ever know... this night will live in my heart forever. \n\nRevision - 7/11 - Imercator,\npoor you... 1/2 a day downloading, I feel for you\nbrother.  This is an AMAZING way to get shows for free and quality issues or not, everyone in the scene never imagined a vehicle like this ten years ago. When we all dealt with cassettes, bad gens, waiting for trades, cut songs, $25 Dick's Picks, blah blah...  A long download on  .50 cent cdrs, + for free, you're not out too much.\nEnjoy the music, forgive the hassle. The Dead  are the Dead, good or bad. Your .02 and mine. Peace....",

In 1999 I purchased two sets of Dick's Picks and was immediately hooked.  As of this time, I only have 12 live performances in the rack, so I am unable to give a definitive review.  However, as has been noted, the sound quality of the .shn files is exceptionally good; flat through the range, muscular low end, highs sail through.  \n\nI have really enjoyed listening to this show...Best performance of 'Row Jimmy' that I have encountered thus far.  Is that Phil singing 'Broken Arrow'?  Also, who was playing keyboards for The Dead at this time?  I know Keith Godcheaux has assumed the role, as well as Brent Mydland and Bruce Hornsby...\n\nAll the best,\nJustin",

I was there with my wife and a couple of my friends close enought to the stage to see what was going on. Jerry had problems with his equipment all night, and he sounded terrible.  He threw his guitar at the end of the first set.  The reason he was standing at the equipment stack was because he was reading the riot act to the tech.  I distinctly remember looking at my wife and saying \"something is really wrong here.  He doesn't look like he's going to make it\".  Botton line: he was pissed and performance showed.  Everyone has bad days.\n\nThe next night things were back to normal They rocked and looked like they'd go forever.  Skip this one and DL the 22nd.",

Later during the break, the woman next to me inquired if I thought they might open the set with Scarlet->Fire.  Knowing the setlists of the past few shows I responded that it was very likely.  After the band broke into Scarlet she embraced me and danced off into the crowd.  \n\nThe highlight of the show is, of course, the stellar final Morning Dew.

I always had these experiences where I saw shows, felt/saw/heard things, and upon hearing the tapes(tapes?!?) those certain things were often times just sensory hallucinations!I thought i heard them do things, say different lyrics, or play lines that I just completely missed. Thats why I've loved collecting shows that I saw, I learned a new perspective. When I was at this show, that same thing kinda happened-I was enjoying myself at this show in my hometown,3rd section back on phil's side.Morning dew comes along, blows my socks off all the way through, then at the end, I thought I heard jerry say \"....I guess it does matter anyway...\" I got so teary and emotional that I didn't stay for the encore- considering that this was a tough time for me,the scene, and what I saw as a hard time for Jerry,I wanted nothing to taint that moment. I left, went home and sat on the couch with some friends and knew that was my last show- i just felt some curtain came down.So, when I first heard this show, right after jerry died,i realized that he did play the shit out of this one, and he did say what I heard, I just had the best feeling, like the curtain opened again.Thanks to archive for bringing this stuff to us-this site is the best cure for a bad day!",

      "review_text": "Drippin' @ the Knick It's funny to me how critical deadheads can be.  The reviews of this show seem to span the full spectrum.    In my case, the Knick was probably the smallest venue I ever saw the dead play in, so immediately there was an intimacy that simply didn't exist @ huge stadiums.  Both nights @ the Knick were a real pleasure for me.  In this case it must be noted (as many have) the morning dew.  As Jerry ripped into it, the acid was flowing at full strength, goose bumps shot up all over my body and the entire venue kind of morphed into this magical space.  My girlfriend and I had moved up some rows due to some weird dudes that decided to stand in our row right in front of us, too much acid made it hard for us speak to ask them to scoot, so we scooted... As morning dew was carrying us up into the stratosphere, a lovely young lady next to us passed over a loaded glass pipe of some piney biscuits, which after ignited  emitted the most immense orange fractal light distortions.  With one, two and three deep exhalations, my eyes began to water, the acid took a deep rush to my head space and jerry's sweet sweet sounds lifted & carried me off.  For all the intensely critical heads, you might remember one or two times in your life having a similar experience @ a show...?  So loosen up.. the dead never meant for their music to be so clearly defined, right from wrong etc... \nSadly, I only started seeing shows in '92.  I wasn't at the Capital Theater in '78.  But I can say, there were moments where they did that thing, that magical thing, and this is one of them - with or without the acid & piney biscuits!",

      "review_text": "reviewing dead shows I always sort of thought the 5 star rating system here (as it applies to Dead shows) \"should\" be about rating the sound quality of the recording only. Let me explain why I cannot accept it any other way. I used to feel the way \"some\" do with regard to whether I thought a GD show was great, or not, but NEVER did any of them suck. I toured from 4/15/83 to this, my last GD show in 95', and I can tell you EVERY show had great memories beyond whether the band was on their game, or off. In hindsight I wish EVERYONE who loves this music would have been able to see the GD live, and in person. I guarantee someone who was too young at the time would walk through fire to relive what some of us took for granted back then. More than one review of this show leans towards the band being \"off\". Of course I've (most all of us) always felt most Grateful Dead songs are about much more than words, and music... They encompass emotion. We all know Jerry was struggling at times, and that it sometimes dragged the rest of the boys down with him in these later years, but all was NOT lost on these occasions. Take people comparing the same song from two different shows, and \"deciding\" which ONE was \"better\", that is ARGUABLY MISSING THE POINT. Sure a 90' soundboard will probably find itself in my car stereo more often than a 95' audience recording, to be sure. That said, sometimes Jerry's struggles led to some of the most heartfelt interpretations by Jerry, and the boys of these songs we all know, and love that I have EVER heard. I think in Jerry's later years some of the \"more mellow\" songs he sang were EMOTIONALLY CHARGED because his vocals were a testament to the struggles he faced offstage that sadly lent a musical credibility unmatched before, or since. If you attended a Dead show and thought it was a bad experience simply because Jerry did not have the vocals you expected from your \"In The Dark\" CD, then you weren't there for the right reason. Thank God that it's possible to relive the MOST emotionally \"charged\" version of Morning Dew I have EVER heard in my entire life, and for that alone this show gets my 5 stars.",

I'd like to focus on on the fact that 1995 had some really mindblowing moments. Incredible versions of Visions of Johanna .... Aiko Aiko at the Spectrum .... The breakout of Unbroken Chain at the Spectrum .... So Many Roads from that last show and many many more. Add to that list this Morning Dew. This solid version goes to the next level 3/4 thru the song and makes it (in my opinion) one of the best Morning Dews ever performed. I put it right up there with the Dew at the Cow Palace on New Years of 76. Garcia hits it hard and doesnt stop. The crowd is in a state of total disbelief at the return of one of the greatest guitarist on the planet.
