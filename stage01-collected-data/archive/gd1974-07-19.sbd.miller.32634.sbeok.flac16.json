You keep delivering solid shows that are mixed, recorded and performed with exceptional quality. You make it look easy, how do you do it?\n\nFor the best in GRATEFUL DEAD shows I recommend clicking on Charlie Miller's name and collecting all his GRATEFUL DEAD shows, he has impeccable taste. \n\nFor easy streaming and downloading users of Windows XP should be viewing this page with RealPlayer. \n\nI recommend adding this show to your 1974 GRATEFUL DEAD collection.\n\n\"One More Saturday Night\" is an audience quality recording.\n\nEat, Drink, Be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nThanks for the Love.\n\nPS: Finding the best GRATEFUL DEAD Show is like mining for gold...when you find a great show, you get the fever, and keep looking for more...there is a system to use, start at the begining and use a spreadsheet to keep track of the year, month and day. That'll keep you organized.\n\nIt's a long journey that starts with the first step. A journey that should be traveled on your own. You should not be deprived the magnificent musical scenery from 1966 to 1974 and beyond.  It is spectacular and breathtaking. \n\nSome people are like me and say that the BEST GRATEFUL DEAD shows were with Pigpen, and they were,; it's a fact. April 71 at the Fillmore East and West contain some of the most incredible live perfomances ever recorded. \n\nThe \"sound\" of the GRATEFUL DEAD changed dramatically after 1971, some liked it, some didn't and others didn't care.\n\nBut GRATEFUL DEAD shows are like beautiful days. There are many of them and then there are days with glorious sunrises and sunsets.  Those shows are best discovered.\n\nThe joy of finding a show you like is intangible and belongs in that realm. Only you can decide for yourself which shows you like and why. 1974 is filled with many wonderful shows, so listen to them all and then decide. \n\nThey are out there, like Gold Nuggets waiting to be plucked from the quartz. Go Mining brothers and sistes...seek and yee shall find...Thar's Gold in them thar archives!!!! Stake your Claim!",

The sound of the WRS post jam into Spanish Jam(spinach jam, anyone?) was and still knocking my precious brain around to places I still can't get without listening to dead...Hearing Jerry get off using a new distortion pedal in his hitherto clean amp-driven sound is ridiculously crazy...And 5 stars!! to offset the downer review from the anti-74 human...everybody loves what they love, just let it be if you don't agree, ok? there's enough negativity on this planet already, without fighting over what year the dead were best...THERE NEVER WILL BE!

I've already commented elsewhere but I have to say it again: this is the most amazing playing by Jerry I've heard, this is as good as it gets... probably the greatest rendition of Jack Straw ever, and possibly Jerry at his greatest ever as well...\n\nI don't like the mix and the other band members appear to be dumbfounded (just like me) by what Jerry is doing - still this is magic.... from the soundcheck jam to OMSN it's just amazing.\n\nSomeone mentioned the distortion (fuzz?) jerry is using: it is indeed amazing but it's not the first time we hear him using a fuzz-pedal... my memory is fuzzy (\"one big smoky haze\") but I remember an amazing China Doll where he uses the fuzz pedal... about 45 days prior to this show. From that show on he keeps \"experimenting\" with the fuzz-pedal, although this show is where it really shines... (check out the second part of Begonias to get an idea what I'm talking about)",

I won't argue the merits of why (notice I didn't say \"best\", I just said \"my favorite\"). During the post-1972 Keith and Donna years, my favorite parts of the shows were the space jams. The Playin' and Let it Grow>Spanish Jam>Eyes during this concert are great examples of why I liked this aspect of their sound best during these years. If you love '74 or '77 best, then by all means enjoy the great sounding shows from those years on the archive. Let's all be glad that there's a website that we can access that has shows for every dead-head's tastes on it.",

      "review_text": "uh...damn Wow. This show is famouus for 2 reasons: (1) the WRS > Let it Grow > Spanish Jam > Eyes (2) The superb mix. However, I just discovered the 30 minute Playin and I must say that it rivals even 6/16/74. I've always had this show on CD and it never got much play...until one late night I decided to listen to this Charlie Miller source with headphones on. All I can say is HOLY SHIT. The SBD I've had for years of this show- the sound quality is wonderful- but THIS source is magical. I've also been more of a 72' and 77' guy. The 74' sound has always sounded sterile and thin to me. The way the Wall of Sound seperated/isolated each instrument and vocals has never been to aesthetically pleasing to my ears. ALL of that changed once I listened to this source. Furthermore, nearly every song in the first set, along with Roses and He's Gone, has a truly unique feel to it that sets it apart from other 74' shows...or ANY shows for that matter. If you already dig the 74' stuff and have not listened to this show yet- or recently- DO SO NOW! \n\nAnd oh yeah- try it with headphones on...the big ear muff headphones...not those slim, jogging, ear plug head phones. Put it on WRS and PREPARE TO BE AMAZED. UH...DAMN, indeed! Peace, Seth Stine",

We read the announcement in the Pink Section of the SF Chronicle, and Knowing my mercurial nature they suggested a road trip from the East Bay to Fresno. I almost took 'em up for it. \n\nAlas, I crapped out because I had to work. My friends upbraided me, they said, \"Work? Who's got time for work?\" They didn't go, either.\n\nYou have perhaps read numerous ravening comments in GD lore concerning this show?\n\nLemme tell ya, they are all true. And this particular version is exceptionally representative. \n\nHere explendent in all their verdant glory: Lots of classic early versions of early 70's originals. \n\nShould note that the way this concert version features a mixture of Soundboard recordings and Audience recordings -- the two do truly meld uncannily. The transitions are so gentle to the ear that if exfolliates an entirely new aspect of the band essentially exhibiting the nature of the band recorded functionally echoed by two disparate sources. ANAMOLOUS CONVERGENCE !!\n\nPITB is absolutely perfect in tone and intent.\n\nMaybe the best, nee,' cohesive, \"Phil & Ned\" Feedback Symphony ever.\n\nThe entire second set is a dream.\n\nHave to give this show a 10 out of 5 stars. \n\nNun The Less.\n\n(p.s. it's still gonna be a five star rating)",

Like, did anyone used to have that \"environments\" LP where side 2 was a \"love-in\"? This is a little like that, except that it records a 1974 audience's realtime reaction to some sounds that were state-of-the-art avant garde both in terms of technology and ambition.

Bobby playing loose and lively with Keith pounding away on the electric piano, I love that funky sound he gets!, Billy snapping away on the snare and Jerry just nailing it to the wall as he was so apt to do in the mid-70s.

I can't help thinking a bear is going to get the drop on me or something.\nOh, Donna and Bobby singing on B.I.O.D.T.L with the rest of the band (Phil and Jerry) in there as well. Donna gives a sweet thank you!\nThis is getting a five and I am only up to 'Row Jimmy' I would be hard pressed to decide between 73 and 74. It would be tough.\nPhil just thundering and Keith very distinct as well. Absolutely no complaints about the drums. Billy much love!!! Jerry with that guitar.\nI hope my batteries are up for this. I built a huge fire. Wow Row Jimmy just went into a giant wind tunnel. Oh, back Thankfully!\n\"That's the way , it's been in town\nEver since they tore the jukebox down\"\nMe and Bobby-Great tune, Weir kills this\nPhil is dropping bombs on this, Holy Cats!\nGarcia likes to shadow Weir with the vocals here!\nLike the way Bob sings, \"Coal mines of Kentucky\"\nGarcia right there with the backing vocals...\nSurprised they never brought this one back?\n\nScarlet Begonias- Another plus for 74 are these stand alone Begonia's. Donna great here as well.\nThe Rhythm section gets so busy on this tune.\nThe jam just goes...\nJust looked up and the moon is headed towards it's peak probably by the end of the week I believe.\nA few planets up there as well, did you ever notice that planets kinda wobble around in the sky. I thought I was tripping when I made that observation back in the days but they still wander around.\nEl Paso- For my money the band is so on they will crush whatever they play. Always interesting to find where Jerry is going to jump in and sing on this tune. Dang Phil!!!\nThis was one of the first dead tunes I memorized!\n\nTennessee Jed-This tune fell out of favor with me in the later years. I am not really sure exactly why? Just never seemed to come close to these versions. Dig Weir singing here and there with Jerry!  Donna laying down some down low harmony.\nAnd ever song is in the Phil Zone.\n\nSo i got these 100 foot trees on the side of my property. they are called Australian Pines which is technically misleading because they have zero sap and are a HARD WOOD. They burn really swell.\nOnly problem is mostly don't need a fire in Florida 10 months out of the year.\nPLAYING!\nAnyway, I learned how to use a chainsaw and I have been cutting all of the junior trees. These things grow 12-20 feet a year, When they hit 100 feet they start getting thicker. The ones on the side of my house are 50 years old and mighty thick. You can't just whack a 100 foot tree, you have to get up high and bring it down bit by bit. When they fall they make the ground shake.\nI don't want yall thinking i am anti-tree. these things have been declared an invasive species and are not allowed to be planted in the State of Florida. They die in extreme cold so you won't see them in frost and snow regions. Funny thing is they also sucker underground so they throw down root lines and then spring up new shoots down the root line. They do have pine needles which is why they are called pines but the needles are deadly to other plants and trees once they take over a patch of ground they dominate and almost nothing else will grow anywhere near them. They are actually very beautiful and except when the dew point is extremely high (May-thru-September) it can be up to 10 degrees cooler in an Australian Pine Forest.\nSo I am keeping two stands which keeps me in firewood but clearing away the trees by  the house which would easily have crushed the house in a bad storm.(which we just had a twister in the county last week)\nWriting this during P.I.T.B. Phil leading the charge. Great to here him and Bill so dominate while Jerry just exploring the outer limits.\nBill almost has a drum solo going here.\nTruthfully, this is some Jam inside the Playin.\nCould it be some folks just are not listening to the music? I find this all consuming!!!\nA strange thing has happened to my fire when i started this at 4:30pm the wind was pretty strong so I went through a ton of wood in no time. I dig these huge trenches fill them with wood and then flood the channel outside the barrier.\nWell about 8pm the wind just died which is good because high wind and fire is more like work then relaxation. Anyway about 9;30pm i got the headphones and started this show. Since then i have been able to kick back and just completely enjoy the flames.\nSheeze they rode that jam into the Reprise like a knife thru butter,,, Wow, they are blazing!\nTemperature is also starting to drop. The next decision I have to make is do I go with Seastones?\nNegative on that. I could listen to the tapers talk perhaps. Nah this sounds like people clapping for a trained seal. Auggh...\nI vaguely remember PRIMUS doing something like PORK SODA? anyway I guess I am now in the one star zone for this stuff. hey, it had to be better than waiting in line for the bathroom. \nHey, i actually am 10 minutes in so 3 more minutes couldn't hurt.\nB.E Woman will be so kind after this!!!\nI actually spent about an hour dosing the fire. i have to go back out again cause i don't want this sparking up tonight.What is wrong with the B.E. Woman??? Sounds fine to me??? This tune i loved every single time i heard it. just a classic. Even liked the way Phil arranged it for Furthur.\nI know Furthur closed Set One with this.\nI did not know the Grateful Dead ever opened a Second Set with this.\nPhil is Everywhere.\n \"Delilah Jones, went to meet her God, and the old man never was the same again\"\nI was surprised that Me and My Uncle had been played so many times over the years.\nIt is easily one of their better tragedy songs.\nIn the later years they would double up on the cowboy tunes. i guess it made for less starts and stops.\nOh, I have been hearing THE ROSES a lot on the California 1978 tour. Jerry's voice in so much better shape here in 74. (It blows my mind how many ballads Jerry had to choose from)\nIn the 80s this tune got pretty scarce and when played usually was a sign of a good set list in progress. (Donna very sweet here)\nJack Straw- One might argue that this tune actually improved over the years. \nIn the sense that the vocals switching between Bobby and Jerry became so intense not too many songs where they trade off like that. in fact the only ones i can think of where covers like 'the Weight' and a few others i am blanking on right now.\nHe's Gone- Oh so pretty to hear Jerry sing this. Strange how this tune could mean almost nothing to me except dancin my butt off but other times it got real personal at the loss of friends and family or something heavy in the Dead universe.\nAfter My Grandmother passed i cried like a baby at a show and i couldn't even stand hearing this after Brent die.\nI am amazed they could keep this energy level going. They haven't even got to the heart of the jams yet. If you loved the Dead's music these were such good years to listen to shows.\nBilly throws in that little marching step as they go into the harmonies. Sometimes when I am at church I get this vibe and i just love it.\nThe connection to Christian gospel is very strong.\nI know the Dead were not exactly Sunday School material but they had so much soul. \nAnyway, I know they are going to go somewhere with this He's Gone but since I didn't pay a ton of attention to the set list i will just be enjoying the ride.\nI really would like to have some way to distinguish between my rating since i mostly rate everything between 4 and 5.\nI guess I will just say this is an over the top 5.\nThey really nailed that He's Gone. o.k. now I remember U.S. Blues!!! Again another thing to favor 74' 'U.S. Blues' is a major improvement over 'Wave the Flag.'\nif they would have just  given U.S. Blues some variety in set list placement. it is almost like the riff in U.S. Blues now sounds like in my head-----THE SHOW IS OVER , GRAB YOUR THINGS, GET TO THE PARKING LOT, SELL SOME STUFF, GET TO THE NEXT CITY/// Anyway just flashing back a little\nglad they went for the Weather Report Suite. Always thought they missed out not playing this from start to finish. But Let It Grow was killer as a 1st set closer. (Again Furthur would play both the entire SUITE as well as Let It Grow.)\nAlways felt they should connect this tune up with Here Comes Sunshine but only two shows that i know of where that went down. one i believe was in Boston . i forget where was the 2nd H.C.S>W.R.S and i am too lazy to investigate it now. 'Same old friends the wind and rain\"\nLet it Grow is the strongest part of the Suite so I can see why that took priority.\nListen to the thunder shout I Am , I AM\nwho shall I tell them has sent me?\n\"I AM\"\n\nAlso just going to say it right here. i don't know why the hatred of Donna got started . She is freakin one of the band in my book . Always was and always will be.\nWeir did his share of screaming on those rock and roll numbers. The line is 'if a man among you has no sin upon his hand, let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band.\n\nThis Let it grow has a crazy jam with who else but Phil again!!! i didn't look at the time but they are treating this like they did the 1st set P.I.T.B namely as a point of departure.\nJerry space jam,,, Wow, this is great!\nIf there is any redeeming value to SEASTONES it might be that the band seems so loose and out there. especially Phil. that atonal stuff is a real trip. This jam is basically the same idea as SEASTONES with the added benefit of Garcia headed out to the Stratosphere. Is it Spanish jam?\n i just recently listened to a show late 60's with a Spanish Jam to close the First Set. \n(It was the TDIH a couple of days ago for January)\nYou know the chords are not far from White Rabbit.\nJeff Mattson likes to pull out the White Rabbit.\nHow cool would that be Spanish Jam >White Rabbit.\nHeck Phil could really crush a White Rabbit!!!\nOh, how cool right into EYES. It is good to hear a different approach into EYES and that was a completely different approach.\nProbably EYES in 1973 is the Zenith of any Dead tune. They came close again with this song in 1977 but for my money the breakout year has the most intense versions of this song. And I don't even need all the extended jamming after the main chorus concludes. I just like the song itself.\nI memorized the chorus by going BHT\nand then SES if you understand those kinda lyric markers.\n\"Sometimes we ride on your horses\"\nSAVE A HORSE, RIDE A COWBOY.\nPhil has a real nice groove going.\nEYES>CHINA DOLL-with something like a Harpsichord\nSat Night-Wind Tunnel sound , oh well\nAnother song that when shuffled in the rotation could really be a blast.\nThankful the whole show was not this murky.\nOUTSTANDING SHOW!!! The CHINA DOLL dislodged my face from my HEAD,,,",

I love that kind of difference in a show!

But then you add the WRS>Spanish>Eyes>China Doll with freaky jams and amazing segues, and how is this not a top-notch show?  Bob's a bit low in the mix the first few songs, but he comes through cleanly starting with the excellent Scarlet.  Really, I need 10 stars to review these shows, because if this is a 5, then what's something like the much-ballyhooed 9/18/87?  2?  I find I have to grade on a curve.  The worst 74 is better than anything from 86, for example.  ",

      "review_text": "Fresyes <br />When they played here in '68 [a two-song show, but we don't have it; nor the two '67 shows], it was their first time out of ballrooms/theaters and into an arena. This show was the resumption of the '74 summer tour. The afternoon soundcheck is attached to most SBD sources, and the show is chiefly known for the Weather Report Suite and its long jam into Eyes of the World. The more-solid first set though is what puts the show up with others from the era.\n       \nFirst Set. <i>Bertha</i> is a hot opener, but the OFF/SBDs are a mess, with half the band missing (incl. Bobby's guitar). Use an AUD. <i>Mexicali Blues</i> has great support from both Jer &amp; Keith. <i>Deal</i> comes early and tightly, the momentum swinging through a sweet <i>Beat it on Down the Line</i>-5, but going a bit flat into <i>Row Jimmy</i> and <i>Bobby McGee</i>. The rest is above average, including one of the best-ever versions of <i>El Paso</i>. On the OFF, <i>Playing in the Band</i> has a 22sec cut @12:26.\n\nSecond Set. After Seastones from Phil &amp; Ned, the first half of the set is not as on-beat as the first set, but Bobby is good and Phil lays bombs throughout. Jer makes the bottle/jaw <i>Me and My Uncle</i> extra. Though far from the tightest, <i>Jack Straw</i> takes off after 4mins. Likewise, though <i>He's Gone</i> is not a great one, it's redeemed by a little jam @12:30, and a flubby <i>U.S. Blues</i> by a wild solo. That's all good because the show peak will be landmark. <i>Weather Report</i> is candy and gets even better during <i>Let it Grow</i>. They back right into a corner so they can fight their way out in a process that includes passing through a Spanish Jam. They go so far into the jam that they never get to the final verse (world began/rise and fall) before smudging into Eyes. It's a 27\u00bdmin WRS, with a 21\u00bdmin Let it Grow section (which is twice as long as 9/10).  At 10:17, the OFF has an abrupt and ill-pitched patch, adding 1min1sec from 7/31. The SBD has a cut @4:03 in LiG of 18secs (the MTX is complete). <i>Eyes of the World</i> is kingly, and the extended Phil solo is crazy  sumptuous. There are little places, like after 11mins where Jer &amp; Phil solo together, that freak me the fuck out. <i>China Doll</i> suffices but <i>One More Saturday Night</i> is a little off (the OFF released the SBD version).\n \n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 4\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nBertha \u2013 great on the AUDs (not so much on SBD/OFF)\nMexicali Blues \u2013 it's the support behind Bobby\nDeal \u2013 gifted earlier\nEl Paso \u2013 actually, one of the best ever\nMe &amp; My Uncle \u2013 Jer makes it so much extra\nWeather Report Suite \u2013 gets even better through LiG and ensuing jam\nEyes of the World \u2013 several sumptuous sections\n\nSOURCES: The miller_32634 is the clearest SBD, and it has the soundcheck jam. It's slightly slow in places and a gap in Let it Grow is unpatched. The gans-finney_217 is slightly better for He's Gone through China Doll. The shure_unknown_fix-102766 is the re-pitched AUD for Bertha. <b>Dave's 17</b> has almost the whole show.",
