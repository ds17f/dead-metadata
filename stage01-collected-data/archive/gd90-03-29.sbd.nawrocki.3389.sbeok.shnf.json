The only reason why this isn't mentioned in the same breath as 5/8/77 is Cornell's epic first set as well. this second set is Atomic. Worth every bit of hype this show has gotten over the years. This is \"dead101\" A MUST for anyone who is into this band.\n\nFunny, even if people feel this is overrated(which is fine) to only have 25 reviews for what has to be considered a historic evening is a bit shocking. Then to look at the last gig they played at soldier field which is a sub par performance to say the least and have 200 plus reviews is bizarre. Oh well their loss.",

Blew off lacrosse practice, sold some textbooks to get money for the evening and headed over to the Coliseum. Had been to the opening night show which was Wednesday the 28th! Good show, stayed pretty straight for that one. The same cannot be said for this Thursday night! First off, soo many more people showed up for this night. The lot is packed. Find some doses, and head to the show. I'm getting a drink when I hear the opening notes of Jack Straw.. complete pandamonium! I was about 25 rows out, my mind was awash in color! The lights and the sounds changed my life forever! I really don't remember much of the first set, I was completely out of my mind. I had no idea Branford played during the first set. Promised Land rocked me to my soul!\n\nThe second set was ATOMIC! I love that description! I rember one awkward moment where Jerry kind of bungles a line in Dark Star and Weir got pissed and sat down on a case throughout the remainder of the song. Then he capped the night w/ an intense Throwing Stones>Lovelight! I had some girl blowing on my neck trying to cool me down during Knockin' on Heavens Door. It was a magical night. After the show was over, I very slowly drove to my neighborhood bar that served minors, and all my friends were getting drunk dancing to whatever, Led Zepplin, and they asked how the show was....  All I could do was smile, smile,  smile!",

First I got a credit card but began getting shut out by TicketBastard the first hour or sooner the show went on sale via telephone.  You had to get tickets via GDTS to be assured getting your golden tickets.  I bought any tickets within 100 miles and put off the logistics of getting there until later. Fucking Branford Marsalis playing with the Dead.  Jerry was really happy to have him there, I could tell.  I think they both were a little bit nervous or just not so rehearsed, but it gave a very loose, jamming and exploratory feeling that had been missing and such giant talents playing together were bound to yield some real gems.  Branford's soprano sax always had given me chills and it really inspired Jerry... that midi flute on his guitar was incredible.  Can you say jazz and eyes?  Worlds colliding.  So unusual but so perfect.  I tripped out on the Eyes > Estimated little reversal thing. Then Dark Star.",

It's about the experience - it's about the trip - connoisseurs can rap and slap this, that and the other tech kind a thing - but if finding this show and hearing this show slaps a big old dumb grin on your face - you can't wipe off - then trade for it or blanks and postage a kind friend.  It's about the vibe and to the extent that this database and the beautiful souls that populated it help re-kindle that vibe, that fire, that passion, that insight, that reminder that something greater than the whole can happen and should well - it's a better world for it back in the moment then and now - keep it positive thoughts like ripples on still water - echo out permeating all.\n\nPaul\nAuthor-Journey Home",

There is nothing not to like.  The whole year was fantastic.  Including the Europe run.  Best decision ever was to charge it up and do these tours.\n\nI knew it was going to be good before it began when I introduced myself to the person sitting next to me and told them I was from DC.  She said, \"I know I see you on the train every day.\"  OK.  No surprise b/c all of you real heads know that the GD was the Clearinghouse for all of the leftover coincidences in the universe.\n\nWhen we left this run one show early (to make the trip to GA not so long) we were on the way out of Long Island late-night.  Got to the toll plaza, which was backed up for about 3/4 mile.  We could see one booth was green and had no cars in the lane clear to the booth.  We figured WTF? and sped right up to it with our VA tags on the car.  Just a couple hicks right?  We look up and the sign says, \"exact change $5\"  Next to that, \"Backing out of toll booth illegal in NY\".  A hungry looking cop strutted out from behind the booth, eyeing the freaks and the VA tags.  Starry eyed Tourmasters of the Universe dump half the roll of quarters into the hopper chicka, chicka, chicka chicka.  Later dude.\n\nI don't know if touring with the GD was the last great adventure in America but it sure was the most edifying 10-15 years I can imagine, and I thank everyone who was in every parking lot from here to East Jabib for making it so fun.",

I bought this unit as a training unit to check out the technology and have a good extra hob on hand for times when we strain our kitchen resources. The intent is to eventually equip our kitchen with an induction cooktop for energy efficiency.\n\nThe good news is that the technology works as advertised. It's remarkably quick and has plenty of power despite running off a normal power outlet. The bad news is that on this unit the heating element (if that is the correct terminology) is only about 7 to 8 inches across. It worked fine when we made soups, though we did notice that only the middle boiled or simmered. However, when frying, the limitation of the element size became a problem. We used a lodge 12\" cast iron skillet to fry fish. The center of the pan put a beautiful tan on the panko, but the outside of the pan was relatively cool, requiring that each piece of fish be flipped to four positions before it was properly cooked.\nWe tested the unit by wetting the bottom of a cold pan and watching how it dried. The center bubbled and dried, but the outer bottom was only warm to the touch. I thought perhaps it was defective, but other reviewers have commented on the problem with <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/bestinductionstove/\" rel=\"nofollow\">induction stove</a>.",

OH SHIT THATS BRANFORD!!! i remember whisper/yelling to my friend Kristen, \"Is that Branford?\" she was like \"i dont know honey is it?\"\n\nand then boom. the tastiest little birdsong ever. but that wasnt even then thing ya know? and it wasnt the dark star either. even though those are epic in their own regards.....\n\nto me it was the damn 'Eyes'. it set the whole thing off and put it in stone. Branford was there. \"Hes gonna probably play this whole set. Wow this eyes is good. Holy Shit.\" and it was all the riffing going on between he and jerr. and like this thing branford kept doing, over and over. and from then on i couldnt ever hear eyes without that horn piece. and it was a good thing!\n\njust slaying it, comfortable from the beginning of the song through the whole thing. effortlessly soloing, riffing with jerr, even inspiring him to flick on his futuristic horn midi effect, and it was just really the whole night embodied. you were at a dead show, it was a special guest night. it was the RIGHT guest, and they were slaying it. and further more, the eyes was the epitome of that WHOLE notion and emotion. everyone in sync. feeling it together. great song choices, epic jams, up up and away.\n\none of my fave dead shows of all time.",

(Wake Up to Find Out)\n\n\u201cWhen I agreed to sit in with the Dead in 1990, I didn't know what to expect, aurally or visually,\u201d says Marsalis. \u201cWhat I experienced was what I remembered music to be in my younger years, something that I'd felt was lost long ago. Process over product. No set lists, light shows and costumes required, but music first. It's an experience I will always remember with great fondness.\u201d",

Set two opens with eyes and the rest is history. Everything that follows in great. Not to be missed. \n\nRe: Sound: I dropped in here just for the reviews. There's also a Charlie Miller SBD, but Wake Up to Find Out supersedes them all; it's the official, must-listen recording.",

Did most of this tour and had already seen some great performances leading up to this night.  The set, to me, was strong right from the start like so many others on this tour.  Being a musician and lover of jazz, when Branford was introduced, I just knew we were all in for something very special.  I can't find the words to described the over 2 hours of magical music that followed, but will just say that everything was right in the world for that special time period.  The interplay between Jerry and Branford, particularly in EYES, is the epitome of the music playing the band and the musicians.  Totally magical.  So blessed to have been there for this special night.",

      "review_text": "My last show Wasn't by choice but life just works out that way sometimes. Saw other iterations of the Dead later but, while fun, they weren't the same and just made me miss Jer even more. \n\nThis is by far the best show I ever saw. I didn't get on the bus until the late 80s so that's not saying much. Still, I'd put this show up against any other. It may not come out on top but it definitely won't get embarrassed.\n\nBranford brought the band up to another level. The sound is much more jazzy than usual but I always thought the Dead had a real jazz feel especially during a lot of the extended jams. Yeah this is more like \"smooth jazz\" but I think even Miles and Trane would have really enjoyed the vibe here.\n\nThe whole band sounds great. Phil is up nice and loud in the mix. Brent is in fine voice and his jangly keyboards fit the jazzy sound perfectly. Bobby sounds good without any of the growling or over the top yelling. Billy is perfect as usual. And Mickey's fine. \n\nHonestly, Jer seems the most reserved. He sounds a little tired but sings well enough. He just doesn't burn it up like he could. That's not to say he doesn't play well. He does. The leads are great and his noodling improv is typically wonderful. Just listen to Dark Star. He was probably just trying to make sure everyone got in on the action and Branford felt comfortable. It worked because this is a collective effort that really shines.\n\nThis SDB is the version I have and its pretty damn great. However, the Wake Up To Find Out recording is spectacular. \n\nI feel bad for the Heads who don't listen to any shows after 69 or 73 or 77 or whenever. They're missing out on some of the most gorgeous music the Grateful Dead ever put out in any era.",
