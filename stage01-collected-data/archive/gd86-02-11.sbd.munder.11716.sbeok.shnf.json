      "review_text": "Neville Bros. My favorite show of 86 is spiced up with the presence of the neville brothers\u2026I know you guys are thinking, \u201c86?\u201d Yes, let me tell you friends, even though jerry\u2019s voice is raspy and worn, there are still some sweet moments in the great year of 86\u2019. Forget the New York Mets, you gotta believe in the Dead in this year. Brent is especially notable throughout this show. He brings the funk all over oakland on this february evening. The show starts out with a china > rider, which is not the most exceptionally played, but it really sets the tone for the evening and gets the crowd excited. The segue between china > rider is done recklessly, as if the band can\u2019t wait for the rest of the show to prove a point. Brent does some nice noodling on the keys during these two numbers. The middle of the first set is played nicely, but nothing spectacular. The pace and intensity is still high, because they don\u2019t play any slow numbers like FOTD. (I\u2019m not a big fan of FOTD, sorry). Fast forward to the Bird Song > Music > Might as well. These three songs to end the first set absolutely rocked. The Bird Song really jammed out hard and brent really went to town on the solo\u2019s. I love the sprinkle effects in this song, and they really lay it out deep and thick. The swing into \u201cMusic\u201d was nice and unexpected\u2026.the band is really playing in form right now, maybe they still think it was 85. This is shaping up to be a pretty intense show. The ragged vocals of jerry have different meaning now, as if an older jerry is still giving the same advice. While the best \u201cmight as well \u201c is definitely 10.29.77, this version is cool because of jerry\u2019s voice. The band really backs him up by jamming hard, and everyone gets involved to close out the first set like a band possessed to take the city over. Out of the 4 shows they played on this run at the Kaiser, this one is definitely my favorite, and it\u2019s not even the second set. The Neville Brothers opened for the dead, and they appeared with the band for the start of the second set. The drums started out the second set, and while some people don\u2019t like drums or space, I think it can make or break a show, so I love to listen to it. And it\u2019s mellow at first, but really kicks into Iko Iko. One of the neville bros jumps in to sing on iko iko. This version gets completely Irie at the 4 minute mark. You feel like you could be on a jamaican island listening to peter tosh. Brent lays down the funkadelics, and provides some nice backup vocals. The Eyes is just great placement and both groups are having fun, and it shows in the music. The eyes is not mellow at all, and they don\u2019t settle into a little spacey version here, they still lay on the drips. It sounds like the Neville Bros brought a horn with them, although i can't confirm this. It sounds like they have some freakin congo\u2019s on stage too. It\u2019s really funky. The band is like the buffalo bills offense, a well- oiled machine (haha-not). They go back into the drums segment for a few minutes, and even though it\u2019s not labeled, I think they should have a drums > space segment, because it is spacey, and it provides for a really cool transition into truckin. Truckin has no spectacular jams, but is well played, and stella blue is well done, and jerry slows the band down a little bit as he provides a little meaning for the song. The outtro of stella is a little sloppy but they recoup for a good slip into NFA. The set closer is a typical NFA, but when the boys come out with the NFA encore, it changes direction and is a completely different version of NFA. It\u2019s sweet! They go into bo diddely and GDTRFB to further the encore (a 3 song encore!) and close out a nicely played 86\u2019er! I\u2019ll come back for more! You should too!",

Another example of the continuous evolution that was the Dead: Mandolins to MIDIs and round and around...this one of the days between shows --- the past glory before the end.

      "review_text": "Just about average. A decent China>Rider to open here. Some energy, but overall just average. The minglewood is poorly placed for this show and lacking in intensity from the collective band. The Dupree\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s shows signs of life at the outset. Jerry looses it in the second verse, and has a lot of trouble with the lyrics. The band on the whole is not clicking here, at one point in dupree\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s it literally sounds like they are all ready to throw in the towel on this tune and stop. Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s voice is in pretty much terrible shape. They close the last 25 seconds of Dupree\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s nicely. Average first two verses in Me and my Uncle, and Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s first solo is choppy and fairly standard. The remainder of this uncle isn\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t worth much more..the mexicali rips. And it is 100% due to Bobby picking up the slack. And thankfully he gets brent into it(brent made numerous changes out of time during minglewood and Uncle). It seems that jerry has loosened up a touch by the end of mexicali. Thank god, because being tight on bird song is a recipe for rotten eggs. \u00c3\u00c2\u00af\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\n\nOn the contrary, the bird song is huge. The wave fully forms behind it and sound just gushes out. Tight initial re-entry. Jer stumbles a few times in the first part of TMNS.\nOverall the tmnp is a nice version. They get very spacey for a minute there and make a nice departure before dropping into might as well, which, hurts b/c, by this point Jer can\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t even finish some words. \n\nThe drums>Iko Iko is fantastic. The actual transition isn\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t as smooth as it could be, but that can be forgiven. The drums opener is more like a jam opener then drums, and it finds it\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s way into a very sweet groove. I\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d have liked them to play that out, although, all is forgiven for the following 20 minutes. Personally I think this eyes is incredibly rushed. The Iko was very nice, and more importantly very energetic, but the percussion in the eyes is virtually out of control. Mick and Bill aren\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t playing together at all. Brent and Bob are really the two keeping this eyes from spinning out. \n\nWhile the eyes was really rushed and not all that pleasant, the following drums is stellar. This night a very backwards one. The songs are sub-par, the setlist structure is all over the place, however the free jams are very impressive and cross multiple style/genre lines with each one. \n\nThe space> truckin is nice, but truckin\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 is not, jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s bends are missing their intended notes, and this trend continues into an entirely too fast stella blue. At least through the first solo. The rest of the show is average, except for the Hey Bo Diddley, which is rawkous and well played. \n\nI\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2m honestly not sure why this show has received so many positive reviews. I imagine on the night in question it was a fun show, but listening back, this show is really sub-par by mid-80s standards. \n\nSound 8/10\nPlaying 5 \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00bd /10\nShow 6 /10 \n\nI am giving this a six for the drums>iko. Take that out and I'd give it a 3 \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00bd",

      "review_text": "One of my Favorites of '86...ever? So this is one of those shows that was widely traded in 86, and for obvious reasons!  In fact, it was one of those shows that was widely discussed on the East Coast as we waited with our annual anticipation of the Spring tour.  \"Have you heard the Kaiser shows with the Neville Bros?\"   was something asked again and again in late Feb 86 and early March, and beyond!\n\nThis is one of my favorite shows from a year that is almost, but not, quite what I call a 'peak' year.  For me, the band is still riding high on the wave from '85, which I consider one of those peak years.  That's all up for discussion, but what's not, in my judgment, are these run of shows at the Kaiser, which always seemed to host one great show after another.   \nI'll be featuring these two with the Neville this month on the Dead Zone as we explore this year's theme, 'the Dead and Friends,' which is guiding us throughout 2011.  The idea for this year's theme came from a 'gap' in last year's terrific New York Historical Society exhibit of the UC Santa Cruz GD archives.",
