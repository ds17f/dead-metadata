(Stayin Alive tease - YES!) \nFine versions of Cassidy, BEWomen, and a great MNS (check out Bob and Donna goofing off before the time change.  really fun!)\n\n2nd set is a smoker! \nThis is a typical 1978 blowout.  I think the lead break in Scarlet shakes with intensity, and after the last verse, the floor drops right out. They noodle for a while, real quiet, and build into a very interesting Fire, with some great peaks and valleys.  \n\nMaybe this isn't the pure Jerry-is-a-god show, but you can hear the whole band really clicking and interacting in some interesting ways (I like the interaction between the Bob slide stuff and the Jerry lead during Fire; it adds something a little bluesy and different, and dang spicy, IMO, and the drummers play their tails off to make this show an interesting listen).\n\nThrow in a very subtle and dynamic Terrapin, and a Werewolves Encore (!) with even more tasty slide playing, and you got yourself one heckuva show.  This is not a 5 because of the year: with all the other '78 change-the-world blowout type shows to compare this to, this show is a 4.5; not the very best of the year, but dang good.  Thanks, LMA!!!!!!!!",

This is a new favorite Fire, it just might be superior to 2-5-78. And it is light years beyond 5-8-77. Scarlet is great too, and sweet harmonies by Donna on all songs.\n\nI particularly like how aggressive Bobby is, he seems to be saying, \"fuck rhythym guitar, we'll have 2 lkead guitars\". Jerry gets extremely competitive with him, and by the end of the second Fire jam you will agree that this is a face-stealing moment and wish that Jerry and Bobby communicated musically in more other shows.\n\nCheck out Donna's singing onf Round&Round as well. You won't believe it! I thought it was some other woman, but no, she is really \"on\" on this night. Get this show however you can!",

High energy college crowd equals a strong run up through the end of terrapin... I think good lovin was kinda a let down after a slammin scarlet/fire. Guitar sizzles throughout, but check out between mins 6 & 7 on scarlet... holy burnin heavens-> a very hard rock guitar version.  The end of this show is a let down but the first 3/4 is near perfect. Jerry flubs during FOTD, but the long guitar jam is experimental and yet seems so clear you wonder at the magic. Passenger is straight up classic sounding, and I'd say this is the one of the best versions of Cassidy, exemplifying the way I like it played. Go Bob!

      "review_text": "You Should Be Dancing This show smokes like a sweet pull off a four foot graffix with a two foot extension.  Set One was the first Dead boot I nabbed and I remember every note like it was written in my soul.  \n\nThe opening Promised Land sets the stage for an epic journey through a hot set of Spring '78 Dead.  A majestic Ramble On Rose eases us into set one with Bobby slip slidin' away on his battle axe while Donna provides beautiful backing vocals to Jerry's lead.  Bobby's slide is the perfect compliment to a soaring Garcia solo that makes it clear we are sitting plush with a royal flush.  Note Keith's beautiful piano outro as the song trails off.  \n\nNext up is a truly unique moment in Dead history.  1978 was the peak of the disco era as Saturday Night Fever had premiered just a few months earlier in the winter of 1977.  The Dead were not immune to disco fever and on this night they put the Bee Gees to shame with a Staying Alive intro that leads into a funky fresh Me and My Uncle that may be the best version ever played.  There is another one from the early 70s that comes out of a Dark Star that may rival this one, but that is a debate for another time.  Keith teases us with the Alive theme throughout while the Rhythm Devils keep things hopping.  It is like someone dosed Travolta and his boys at 2001 Odyssey.  Next comes a ridiculous transition into Big River.  Billy and Mickey toy with us, switching rhythms back and forth as the music plays the band.  Bobby is jive talking and Keith takes a fine solo.  At this point it is an all out dance party.  \n\nNext up is Friend of the Devil as Jerry mercilously allows us to catch our breath.  An exquisite intro shows how Bobby was really coming into his own as a rhythm guitarist.  Keith leads off the solos before yielding to Bobby, then Jerry, as the three play off of each other beautifully while being backed up by the Rhythm Devils, not to mention some fine bass work from Phil.  Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee.  First one says she got my child but it don't look like me...no it don't!\n\nA fine Cassidy follows and then comes a oh-so-sweet version of Brown Eyed Women.  Billy and Mickey are on fire, again toying with the rhythm.  The bridge is beautiful with Donna's backing vocals right on point while her husband does some fine work on the keys.\n\nNow get ready for some heat as the boys warm up for Passenger.  Garcia can't wait to get things going and so Bobby leads them right in.  Phil is bombing his ass off.  Bobby and Donna are in perfect sync.  Jerry is punishing his guitar with heat on the slide.  Nasty!  False alarm...the only game in town!  I agree that there is some serious chemisty here between Bobby and Donna.  Jerry shreds his ass off as the heat cranks even higher.\n\nI typically can't stand It Must Have Been The Roses but on this night the boys teach us a valuable lesson in psychedelic country and western.  Brilliant!\n\nNext up is Dance Fever USA.  The Music Never Stops.  I dare you to even try to stay in your seat.  Billy and Mickey will not allow you.  Phil cannot help you either.  There seems to be a beat now, I can feel it in my feet now.  Listen, here it comes again.  Donna shines.  This has to be one of her best nights ever.  I don't know what the hell was going on that night but the trade offs between Bobby and Donna are epic.  Bobby grunts.  Donna replies, \"good god\".  Bobby: \"Cause I need somebody to help me.\"  Donna: \"Really?\"  Tremendous.  Jerry then takes over, reminding us who is really the boss.  Ripping notes, shredding strings.  I think he was trying to destroy his guitar.  I'm surprised he didn't.  The band comes to a huge showstopping close and we are left only to ponder what exactly just occurred in the previous hour plus.  The answer is a rip-roaring, jaw-dropping, dominating set of 1978 Dead that leaves no question as to the power of this band.  Once I got my hands on this tape I was hooked for life.  Six Stars.",

      "review_text": "I was in normal that night - Amazing sunset reaking through dark clouds shining a light on the Illinois farmlands as we drove down to Normal from Chicago after later afternoon rain storm - The room venue lined during the show with Illinois State Troopers in Yogi hats inside of the venue throughout the show but it di not diminish the merriment - Venue was a modest basket ball area with stands on three sides of and an empty dance floor on the hard maple boards.  I have no clue what the sounds were during the space jam but it was unique - and never heard before - some kind of synthesized percussion.  The Dead played the Riviera either a week before or after this show in Uptown Chicago but the setup, decorations and light show at Normal were completely unique and unlike any of the other 20+ shows I saw around the Midwest from 76-79 - the night ended at 3 AM at Taco Loco on Lawrence in the northside of chicago for mexican breakfast - we were all famished and satisfied.",

Starts out w Bobby cowboy tunes and some good slides! Hits hard right away second song in, Ramble on Rose. By the time they get to Music Never Stopped it\u2019s a circus! Best one I\u2019ve ever found! (In my mind!) Must\u2019ve been the Roses is swoon worthy. The Scarlet/Fire is smokes and the Black Peter is painfully good. \nAnd did I mention the Passenger?! \ud83e\udd2a\u2764\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99",
