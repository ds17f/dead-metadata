But, after several lines, Garcia restates the St. Stephen theme, jams brillantly off of it, and then heads back to the next verse.      \n\nThen, back on schedule, the answer to the answer man is: Not Fade Away.  At the 3:30 mark, Garcia sets off on a remarkable journey, leaving a  trail marked by memorable melodic phrases and motifs (e.g. dig his pause for bossa nova-like interlude at 5:19).  At 7:25 he is still pulling melodic phrases from god knows where.  At 8:30 he comes up with yet another one.  At 9:38 he suggests with 3-4 notes that they return to the tune at large.  Out of the wings comes Mr. Pen for a nice vocal duel with Weir:  \nWeir: \"Not Fade Away\" \nPen:  \"Cain't Fade a-WAY!)\n\nAll this while playing outdoors in unseasonable 40 degree weather.  Nothing like the cold to concentrate the mind....",

Though the NFA and St. Stephen are great, a definite highlight is the Good Lovin'. After a rough start (with a pissed-off Pig commenting on a microphone glitch), the drums and jam of this version soar, one of the best jams of the entire year and one of the best Good Lovins ever. This track alone is enough to download this show. \n\nTo the reviewer directly below me, I suggest that you go to 6/8/69 for a definitive Dancin'. If you thought that this Dancin' was a mind-blower, strap in your seat belts for 6/8/69. It has the best Dancin' ever, IMO.",

Casey Jones is stone perfect.\n\nThe version of Dancin' is molten gold with Phil Lesh unleashing some riffs that are so devastatingly perfect that after hearing this version you will imagine those riffs every time you hear the song -- and every other version will somehow seem lacking afterward (kind of like how the 9/18/74 version of To Lay Me Down renders every other electric version irrelevent).\n\nAnd the NFA -- holy crap -- at its peak the Dead sound more like Ash Ra Tempel or Tago Mago-era Can than any American band of the time except perhaps the Stooges or the MC5.\n\nAm I getting my point across here?  This is not an ordinary Dead show.  Even the version of Next Time You See Me is transcendent.\n\nDo not believe the reviewers here who claim the next nite is better: they are wrong.\n\nEND THE WAR NOW\n\n/40 year anniversary of this remarkable performance is approaching.

      "review_text": "Phil and Jerry's Firey Dance and Mourn-ing Dew I've listened to tons of Dead shows and have spent a great deal of time in this incredible archive as well and have been waiting for the opportunity to review my first show. This is my first review in part because this show blows me away. \n\nOne of the qualities, I think we all agree, that makes the Dead so distincitive is Phil's bass playing -- the way Phil himself drives improvisation, by, in many ways, playing his bases as much like a lead guitar (a lead bass?) as a traditional time and rhythm-keeping bass guitar. Equally amazing is Jerry's response to Phil and vice versa -- i.e. the way the two play off each other, drive each other, and fire each other up. In many shows (this one included), the Phil-Jerry interplay alone drives the band into wonderous places on amazing musical and improvisational journeys. This show is neither the only great example of such interplay nor, perhaps, the all-around best show of an amazing year, 1970. But Phil and Jerry are tuned furiously into each other here and the results in \"Dancin'\" and \"Good Lovin'\" are spectacular! I haven't listened to 6/8/69, but this is the best \"Dancin'\" I've ever heard, and I'm a fan the 69-71 vintage of the song. It is sublime and intense. It gives me chills.\n\nThis show has an intensity and edge that I'd like to think emerge from the cold outdoor University setting that was brimming with tension a few days after Kent State. Great comment from the reviewer who listens to this \"Morning Dew\" through the context of Kent State and the shock waves it sent. It is an intense almost elegaic dew -- maybe not one of the greatest -- but it has a vibe and atmosphere you can drink. Might we call it \"Mourning Dew\"? \n\nOverall the rest of the show is strong 1970 stuff, and the sound for me is fine. Get this one; it's super and has an intensity and perhaps a real historical relevance, considering Kent State, the Peace movement etc....",

I've been listening to this show on an old hissy tape for 15 years, and experiencing it now, with this sound quality, is a moving experience.  What can I say about this \"Dancing\" that hasn't already been said?  Well, I'll try.  Jerry's work on this has a ferocity and grittiness, Phil (as stated much more eloquently below) leads them on this journey with authority and grace.  Bobby's lilting support during the song's mellow middle section is gorgeous, and the drum support is a soundscape in and of itself.  The notes Jerry hits right after Bobby bellows \"C'mon everybody get up and dance around now\" usher in several minutes of pure musical might.  Also of note is the riff Jerry works right before they go back into the verse towards the end.\n     A great China Rider that develops slowly and beautifully into a tight groove follows, and the Morning Dew is as emotional as it gets.  It brings tears to my eyes when Jerry hits that last \"I guess it doesn't matter.....\"\n    Lastly, hilarious stage chatter abounds.  Pigpen's raucous reuqest for a new mike, Bobby lamenting the cold, and Phil's genuine thanks are jewels.  What do you think ever happened to that lost little kid named Frank?",

My local NPR station doesn't play the GDH in order and they used this one about a month ago when it was fund raising time.  They started talking over the jamming in Dancin' in an effort to shake you down for money.  In a stoned stupor at 11:00 on a Sunday night, I promised them $100 if they'd shut up so I could get back to jamming.  I never paid that bill, but it worked anyway.  The next morning I had one of the most pleasant Mondays ever listening to this.  This show is that good.  \n\nThe jam in Dancin' is otherworldly.  As a previous reviewer noted, it will supercede any other version as the new definitive.  China Cat is blistering.  Next Time You See Me has great dual lead vocals with Pigpen and Jerry.  Great Morning Dew.  Just a great, great, great show, which was a FREE show to boot.  Wow!",

He prolly got contact high and was mesmorized by what he heard.....his easily impressionable young mind was changed forever.....he dropped out (from the 3rd grade), tuned in, became a dead-head and went out on the road..... he is still following bobby and phil across the U.S. to this day.",

My favorite DANCIN,,, lots of intensity from the National Guard shootings on College Campuses to a very chilly day in the beginning of May in New England.\nThis was always in my box of 10 tapes up in the front seat.

At the time i was already a fan, and saw them and the JGB play the Boston area multiple times, but had no idea they had been right there on the student center steps. What a dynamite show. Jerry crushes every note, without ever overplaying.  The band is tight and I\u2019ve never heard better from this era.  I like to think the new kids at Bexley get this stream, and it echos in Kresge Plaza each and every May 6th afternoon.  ",
