We had a great time during the day going down the water slide and hangin' in the lot. this was back when the lot scene was mellow and very cool just to hang. This was before the onslaught of nitrous too. There was however plenty of good 'L' to be had and many pertook (sp?). We got into the place during daylight. The place was like a mini Alpine with about 1/3 the lawn...not too big, not too small. \n    The 1st set was great. I remember a steamboat going past on the river which was just behind the stage. Hence the name River Bend. The Let it Grow was insane.\n    This was the 25th anniversay tour so they had the killer backdrop of the skeliton w/a gun (i think??. they had also broken out 'Cryptical' 3 shows earlier at the Greeks and then skipped it at Alpine. So there was a buzz in the air! We got the whole thing: Cryptical>drumz>space>comes a time> the other one>cryptical!!!! I was in ecstacy! Comes a time was rare for me back then too. I recall boogying my ass off & making friends with an usher who was having a great 'ol time watching us psychodelic dancers> This night the boyz were into their 'play it soft, play it psychodelic' mode and the drumz>space was creepy & scary!!\n    To me this show is a trip back to a more innocent time when all that mattered was getting to the next show!

He's Gone is THE version of this song- somewhat upbeat with great vocals- and that funky feedback type stuff at the end of the song that sounds so good.\n\nThe Cryptical/Other One is EPIC EPIC!.  Last third of Space has a nice little \"Other One\" tease that magically transforms into Comes A Time, again one of the best versions ever.  Short Other One followed by the Crptical follow-up, closed off by a not bad Wharf Rat.  Bobby brings it all back home with around and Good Lovin! \n\nCan't find anything to complain about here!",

I know a lot of people have reviewed this show but this one is just too good not to throw my two cents in!\n\nThis show, of course, features two of the recent bust-outs in Cryptical and Comes A Time, as well as (in my mind) the archetype Aiko as well as a scorchin' Samson and soul-tingling, deep He's Gone.  But this show shines in places you'd least expect it - check out the Loser (Garica's lead just weeps for that poor bastard) and the, oh my god, Let It Grow.  Garcia is doing his best Al DiMeola during Let It Grow.  Seriously, Garcia's guitar on this one is spectacular.  Jaw-dropping good!  One of the first clues that this is one for the ages is the Minglewood (of all things), which they wring out with all their might.\n\nMan, this is such a good show!  One of the astonishingly good aspects of this night is Bob and Jerry's interplay.  As amazing as Jerry is on this one, Bob is on the top of his game.  His slide work on Samson (which you can really hear on this recording) is incredible.  He's practically co-soloing with Garcia on the He's Gone and then pulls out the best Smokestack I have ever heard.  Plus, the R&R blasts into my favorite post-Pig Pen Good Lovin' ever.  For all the times Bobby's Good Lovin' or Lovelight rappin' left people scratching their head, this one he nails.  This show just drips with energy and I never get tired of listening to it.  \"Push back, push back the night - that's right!\"  \n\nThis was my first show.  I feel like I've seen some good shows in the subsequent 10 years, but this might be my favorite.\n\nBack in the day, I had some great audiences of this night but this is the best recording I've heard!\n  \n\nThis is worth 5 stars.",

      "review_text": "Quality from '85 In general, I know little of '85 and I place considerable weight on the quality of the reproduction.  \n\nRolling the Dead's work and the archive's wonderfully vast material through Audio Research components and Thiel's on the front-end tends to reveal impoverished sources and low-brow mastering.  \n\n(Ever disappointing are those in the community that mistake overindulged tail ends for quality sound.  I wish I had access to these people.  I would consider it charity work to introduce them to the subtlety, balance, and integration of superior reproduction\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2both source and system.  Or, perhaps, a step in the direction of medical work to diagnose damaged or deficient hearing.)  \n\nNonetheless, it strikes me that you don\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t need to know much about \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c285 to know that this night turned out about as best as could be imagined.  What\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s more, it\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s not a final recording that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s ideal by any means, nor, at my guess, is the mastering--too much herky-jerky.  However, that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s not entirely fair given my speculation as to what the source offered.  BUT, you won\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t find the machines or their users short of the capturing magic (unless your system is the corrupting influence).  Makes me long for the days of recyclables and tv screens.  This show captures a glance and with or without a finer sampling of your vice, promises to make it a dance.\n\nIt will reward your attention.",

Got on the bus, hitched up to Cleveland for the next one.   It is '85, and Jerry sings better than most nights that year.  He is playing was pretty on, the band had strong energy all around.  The He\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s Gone,  The Other One (Including 2 Cryptical Envelopment segments), and Good Lovin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 are the high moments from tape.  My personal memories were of everything dissolving during Drums & Space, and Jerry bringing it all back together in that special way only he could during Comes A Time.  Still brings shivers down my back!  I do think the Chula Vista Comes A Time is tastier.\n\nIt\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s a strong show for the time, and Bobby\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2terrorist rap during Good Lovin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 is especially appropriate in these times.  \n\nIMHO, this was not the worst show ever, by a long stetch.  There were better and much worse in the days to come.  I\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2d say the Garcia\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s last few shows before his coma and again before the end make him sound very vibrant and young in this high point of 1985, a manic moment in a bipolar year for the Dead. \n\nI rate it 4 tabs.",

I still am not sure why, though it may have something to do with the Cryptical breakout that year, the soul-filled He's Gones', and the energy levels. To borrow a phrase from someone else, I have an irrational fondness for summer tour 1985. Fun, fun shows...warts and all.",

Them.   But...\n\nWhat a hideously sick and raunchy version of USB this is. Sloppy>mistakes>galore>ignore>brilliance. All that change all that fast. A presence that follows you around and gives you chase to rhythm.\n\nThe P.A. twinges during this show are Mr. Healy using the \"effects\" on vocals which eventually got him fired. I remained cloven-hoofed on this one, for I enjoyed Healy's colorizations on the vocals, yet I know it disturbed a lot of listeners. \n\nHowever, I have not heard many of the shows of the 80's. Maybe Healy's histrionics wore thin fast. I don't know. Sounds like a possibility ~ if you have logged 400 plus shows during this time.\n\nFrankly, 1985 is new territory for old Dead Heads like me.\nAnd frankly, I surely do love what I hear.\n\nI donate $25.00 to this organization on an annual basis.

A standard They Love Each Other is followed by an excellent version of Minglewood that has some remarkable soloing from Garcia.  The other highlight of the first set and possibly the brightest spot of the show is the set closing Let It Grow.  This version is ferocious and possibly in the top five all time.  It simply has to be heard to be believed.\n\nThe second set starts off with a very nice Iko that segues into a scorching Samson.  Again Garcia is o fire and he nearly tears the building down.  This is followed by a soulful rendition and a short but always welcome Smokestack.  The biggest surprise of the event occurs when they bust out Cryptical, only the second time played since '72(the first being busted out on 6-15).  The momentous occasion outweighs the actual performance of the song, which is very short lived before Drums comes along.  The boys hint at Other one but instead go into a very nice version of Comes a Time which is always welcome.  The Other One finally erupts out of Comes A Tie and it is a monster.  This is primal Dead at it's best and sounds as if it could be from '69.  Garcia is playing like a maniac.  This is the highlight of the second set and shouldn't be missed.  The jam flows into a short Cryptical reprise which in turn segues into a soulful Wharf Rat.  Jerry's vocals aren't completely up to task but I've heard much worse.  Three rockin numbers end the show.",

We drove up to Cincinnati from Lexington,Ky, enjoying a beautiful sunny summer afternoon. Riverbend Ampitheater is set up so you can see the boats behind the stage and are looking across the river into Ky. 1st set the weather was perfect...then the storm clouds built up across the river. A torrential rain storm began during the break, with cloud to ground lightning strikes that made us wonder if the Dead would come back out at all. Of course, they did, during the hardest part of the rain for a scare the bejeezus out of you 2nd set. Enough has been said about the songs themselves, but the circumstances surrounding their performance is what stands out to me. I mean, when they sang \"if I had my way, I would tear this whole building down\" in Samson, they meant it! It seemed as if they were egging on the storm, daring it to do its worst...thundering drums echoing the actual thunder.And they wanted more. Smokestack Lightning during lightning...I mean come on!!!! Then Cryptical (REALLY?!?!) I remembered the Drums>Space as a frightening experience. WOW!!! You will be hard pressed to find a better show than this, in my opinion.

Comes A Time and Wharf Rat in and after (or just out of) the Cryptical Envelopment suite is a tasty treat. Second set really never lets up. First set closer, Let It Grow, is featured on the 30 trips definitive live story.",

      "review_text": "Hometown show The first Dead show I attended, had just graduated from high school in Cincinnati and the Dead hadn't played in town for many years leading up to this. Went with a bunch of buddies, got sooo stoned, had some red shades on during the whole show which was a nice effect on everything. I remember they had some big banner up behind the stage (something about 20 years). I didn't yet know their whole catalog so this show was a lot of firsts for me: Other One, Weather Report, Comes a Time, Wharf Rat. A great time, and I'll echo what the earlier reviewer said about the weather, it was intense. Dark and stormy. I saw the Dead maybe 4 other times after this but this one was the most memorable. 1985 was before Touch of Grey introduced a whole different, rowdier? crowd to the scene. I now know it was a relatively special setlist for the 80's, but honestly I'm not a big fan of how they sounded around then- much more into their 60's sound and vibe. Sorry, I'm biased!",

My friend had been listening for a while, and told me about how awesome this show was, with the rain forest sounds in Drums > Space, and convinced me to listen on a night we were drinking heavily, and I was sold!!! This show is still the epitome of the Grateful Dead as far as I'm concerned. ",

      "review_text": "Riverbend Magic 85 For 1985 it's 5 stars. What I recall is that everyone there had a magical evening.  Storms were in the air, it was cooler than normal for summer Cincinnati and there was lightning in the sky behind the band during Let It Grow.  Perfect vibe for that song.  I also recall a tugboat pushing barges upriver going behind the stage during He's Gone.  I saw them 25 times in 1985 from coast to coast and every show I thought it might be the last.  The rumors about Jerry were out to the tour followers and we treated every show with a feeling of dread and an urgency to see as much of it as possible.  Get it while you can.\n",

      "review_text": "Lightning strikes not once but twice <br />Riverbend Music Center was new at the time and in a cool location [in Anderson Township, well SE of the city, overlooking Kentucky], but it's one of those sheds where lawn ticketees are on the outside, peering in through a slot. They had built up goodwill in Cincinnati in the '70s, but at this point hadn't been here in 9 years. They played this venue one more time the following year, then it was back to the Coliseum. In this era Cincinnati still had notoriety for the Who concert <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who_concert_disaster\" rel=\"nofollow\">disaster</a> and for mayor Jerry Springer personally welcoming visiting bands. Peak '85 is late summer&gt;fall, whereas June in general is below average to average. But this show is more of an outlier \u2013 perhaps the tour's most consistent night.\n\nFirst Set. It takes a few to warm up. Jer gets way lost on the verses for <i>Alabama</i>, though it comes together somewhat on the end jam. Though Bobby fares better with <i>Greatest Story, They Love Each Other</i> trainwrecks on the second verse, and Jer has to make up for it by playing like he do. The turnaround is at <i>Minglewood</i> [bluegrass fillies/here in Cincinnati]. Bobby's Slide Practice\u2122 is relatively minor and Jer is getting hot. Most of the verses are snafued on <i>Tennessee</i>, but the solo is nifty. After a solid <i>Brother Esau</i>, Mickey says that Bobby's song had a \"hostage ending\", so Bobby teases the rhythm section on-mic. This is a strong <i>Loser</i> but the <i>Let it Grow</i> is a beauty contest winner; a hyper-melodic version, and perhaps the year's best. On the OFF, noise at the beginning is removed with heavy filtering, and the sustained notes leading to Bobby's \"back in just a little bit\" are edited. \n\t\nSecond Set. <i>Iko Iko</i> is just solid enough to squeak by, including Bobby's misquotes [Dixie boys on the battlefront/Wild Tchoupitoula goin' chomp chomp\t\tchomp/Brother John is gone/wild wild chomp chomp chomp chomp], when he unexpectedly takes a verse. He makes up for it on a plat principal <i>Samson &amp; Delilah</i>. Jer then completely sends it with a brilliant <i>He's Gone</i>, that pairs with <i>Smokestack Lightning</i> like Gouda and a Mendoza Malbec. <i>Cryptical</i> is the 3rd of the 5 return shows (all in '85), but almost a wash. After a <i>Drums&gt;Space</i> cleanser, <i>Comes a Time&gt;TOO</i> and <i>Wharf Rat</i> (good sound &amp; tones) are solid enough to leave a wreckage of strewn, happy Heads. <i>Cryptical</i> completes a sammich that looks good on paper, but the best playing is elsewhere. It dips for a perfunctory <i>Around &amp; Around&gt;Good Lovin'</i>. Though it's OOT, <i>U.S. Blues</i> is an all-out shooter.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u2153 stars\n\nHighlights:\nNew Minglewood Blues \u2013 turnaround into X\nLet it Grow \u2013 hyper-melodic\nHe's Gone&gt;Smokestack Lightning \u2013 pairs perfectly\n\nSOURCES: The miller_25315 is pitched <u>mostly 1% fast</u>, but the mix is better in places than the OFF and it's the best SBD. It also has a repeated section of 25secs, @3:40 in Space \u2013 as do half of SBDs and oddly some MTXs. The other half of SBDs are missing the beginning of Space (intact on the OFF &amp; me80_hessberg). The murphy_2274 runs slightly slow, and harrell_8198 is bricked. <b>30 Trips</b> has the whole show. <b>Definitive Live</b> has Let it Grow.",
