First off...a buddy and me hi-tailed it to the front when the gates were open...laid down a nice blankee...once the opener(Steve Miller) came on...we started getting crushed by fans...it was hot I felt like I was at an Aerosmith show...not a Dead concert.  Some chick came stumbling by me stoned and naked and was escorted via the stage by a bouncer...let's see...Steve Miller sounded pretty bad...all of the speakers cut out on \"Fly Like an Eagle\"...I like Steve Miller but this night it was bad.  Cut to the chase...the Dead came on and some fool was playing a flute along with Touch of Grey...the big problem was he couldn't play...actually...he played along the entire first set.  I lost my shoes somewhere druing this show and had to drive to Florida barefooted...oh well...to me the sound was awful...the music was borderlined boring and the people were rude.\nJust my five cents.\nGiving it 2 stars and 3 foohees just cause I can.",

Being at the show was great, and everything sounded great at the show, but it just seemed much longer than this download.  There were ALOT of people here.  Those who have been at a Buckeye Lake show know what that means....its just an open field. Anyway, this recording is perfect.  And it does capture what I remember about the first set- it was tight.  I love the Brown-Eyed Woman.  If you are looking for long jamming versions, this isn't the show.  This is more like the show you give to the friend you are trying to convert. At least the first set. The songs really are that tight.  The second set gets a bit lost for awhile, but Jerry comes on strong on Wharf Rat.....This was the Dead in the early '90s.  Its worth a download.",

There was most certainly not a flute player during the first set.  I am sure of this, as I was about 20 feet in front of the soundboard center stage for the entire show.  Have you not heard of Jerry Garcia and midi?   The first set was incredibly tight.  The second set was not the longest ever, but it was one of those nights were the second set was like one long piece of classical music with each song being a different movement.  Buckeye Lake has a special feel and sound to it, and the Greatful tapped right into that on July 1, 1992.\n\nThis is one of those nights were the Greatful was able to take their fans (crowd) on a mini-vacation from the time they hit the stage",

So, yeah, you may have heard a brief harmonica somewhere, but it wouldn't have made it on the recording I think...we were no where near the tapers.

As far as the atmosphere goes: I worked many-a-shows at Buckeye Lake, not just the dead.  But I tell you what: compare THIS crowd to a margaritiville crowd (ala Jimmy Buffett) and let me tell you what; I'll take the dead crowd any day.  We saved SO MUCH MONEY not having to hire extra security- however, we DID have to hire extra medical hands and we had quite a few first aid tents (those of you there surely remember)- to take care of the \"occasional flip-outs\", etc.  I'd have to honestly say that we were top five if not top three in terms of the venues that took care of our patrons.

Maybe in the audience but, not on stage. \n\nEstimites where saying there where over 70,000 people ( some as high as 90,000 but I don`t believe that ) there and considered a record attendance at the time for a Buckeye Lake Concert. Being there, it wouldn`t surprise me. Wall to wall people everywhere. May still be a record attendance.\n\nI agree it was kind of a creepy vibe that night. One security man got sprayed in the eyes with a LSD and had to be choppered out to the hospitol for observation. One fellow I remember was naked in a fetal postion and wrapped himself around a security mans leg. His girlfriend pleaded saying, \" Don`t arrest him! Don`t arrest him! Where from Los Angeles! \" \n\nAnother guy came up to me and kept saying \" Yeah man, yeah man, yeah man \" over and over again.\n\nNear the beginning of the second set, a group of hippies formed a circle around my brother and I and started doing an impromptu dance and going around in a counter-clockwise motion. Free entertainment. Hope it was a good luck dance. \n\nThere where other odd experiences and glad I was there at least. Something peculiar about that concert and one I`m sure I`ll remember for a long time. A memorable night for sure.",

Maybe some of it was just my karma catching up with me...I'd just seen my hometown Rich Stadium show a month before with my girlfriend, now wife, and that was a magical memorable night. Then I was stupid enough to let these three girls con me into driving to this show...I fooled around with one of them (she turned out to be underage, even) and I barely knew the others, they didn't strike me as big fans...a lot of the people outside seemed strange and not that friendly...I met a kid that I'd known a few years before who'd been a stupid rude punk and suddenly he'd grown dreadlocks and jumped on the bandwagon...I didn't get in, but the sound was nice and loud so I could hear enough to think they were just kinda going through the motions...I spent most of the night playing guitar in the lot, feeling lost and alone, while some creepy hick teens hung around...my car started to break down as we left; where I pulled off the highway, the first thing we saw was this big dark cemetery...the girls started freaking out, but I got the car running again...only to have it go completely as we were passing Cleveland; we were stranded in the nastiest part of town late that night with barely a dime, and the girls were nothing but a hassle the whole time. Everything in my life was a lot less bright and fun after this show, and we all know what happened to Jerry. My friends have played me tapes of decent shows after this, and I regret that I didn't see the band at least one more time before the end, but it had all gone sour for me- my youth and the Dead at the same time...",

Bird Song has some very nice Jerry moments, the Baba O'Reilly into Tomorrow Never Knows is a lot of fun for the novelty of it all and the West LA Fadeaway where Steve Miller and his harmonica player sit in is enjoyable. Truckin' also has some nice energy but no real jam to speak of. The standout performance for me is drums and space with it's electronica version of a train cruising through stage left to stage right. I seem to remember it being quadraphonic at the show and it swirled around my head. Now that bit and the following Jerry midi excursions into the unknown were the only real mindblowing things about this show. It was a fun time to be sure and a beautiful day from what I remember, just a solid and not too remarkable show. It's worth a listen if you were there or if you are a fan of drums/space. Camping out and hearing the whoosh of nitrous tanks all night long was another experience I won't forget. This was my second to last show. Once again thanks to the Archive.",

That was us.\n\nWe were among the first to get in; the sound crew played the William Tell Overture as Heads raced down to the stage....meanwhile we casually strolled to the stack which was farthest from the stage (which looked to be, from our perspective, as big as a postage stamp held at arm's length). A hillock rose from the industrial high-lo which held the stack high in the air, and we walked up that hill until our sternums were on the same plane as the centre of that stack, about 15-20 yards.\n\nMan was this show ever SONIC, and it remains my favorite show of 1992 in spite of all the technical problems and hurried post-space slot. OMG, did we dance and have fun...\n\nThat first set is stronger than I would have expected in this period of The Journey (even Picasso Moon sounds good!)...in my experience, I feel that a lame first set became the norm after 7/1/92.\n\nThe second set prior to drums is really interesting and frustrating all at once with Steve Miller and Norton Buffalo sitting in after the Saint opener...you see, for all the time that the roadies took to get the gear squared away after Saint someone forgot to plug in Steve Miller's mic (way to go guys)...on the bright side that Saint is so loud it will dry your hair, and that Smokestack Lightning with Steve Miller's input is fun fun fun...good ol' Blues.\n\nDrums/Space are worth the download alone; the train noise moving from side to side in drums is midi but the horn is actually a five-chime Nathan air horn what Billy is wearing slung upon him like a guitar...the air compressor that the stage hands use to the power their air tools for the staging is what drove that sucker...Billy had to wear ear protection, and he did not have to mic it. Way, way cool.\n\nAfter Space the show morphs into a hurried and inconsequntial muddle...oh well, you can't have it all, especially in 1992.

First, it was very hot, and i saw alot of folks who just had not really experienced a Dead concert. My brother and first wife went to this one, and perhaps i am comparing the crowd to Deer Creek where we went to both shows(i am from Indy, currently living in Florida)but from the \"herding\" of the patrons by the authorities, yes I remember people moooing getting across the road, to the number of drunken idiots who just didn't ever get it, it was totally different. in previous years, the crowd was much more in tune with the cosmos. I actually liked the set lists, but they may have played to accomodate Steve and James Cotton, harmonica.Does anyone remember the soundtrack to the wizard of oz at tne end of the show as you were leaving? You can tell in this show that Jerry and Vince had not yet begun to click like he did when Brent and Bruce were in the band. Plus it was at the end of the tour and Jerry would eventually become ill. Nevertheless, a good time, good sound, excellent drumz/space as usual, love the airhorn. Not the best show i ever went to, but not the worst either, and deadheads always appreciate a good effort.",

To begin with, someone dosed me properly prior to the show, and while that isnt really a big deal, I had been trying to walk a cleaner line.\n\nFortunately, it was nothing new to me.

It seemed everthing was lighthearted and roadhouse like UNTIL that freakin' Spoonful. Even the lights went red and violet and blue and dark in a way, and it seemed every damn junky inside the show either shot up or came out of the woodwork.\n\nI always enjoyed Buckeye Lake because it was usually so laid back. That night, after that spoonful, it was just plain weird; from the medivac helicopter landing INSIDE the show, to the  junkies falling all over themselves on the way out.\n\nPhil, on the other hand was hitting what seemed subsonic tones, and the quadrophonic drums/space was brain melting. I remember the Wizard of Oz, and the fellows suspended above the stage during the encore. \n\nThe parking lot outside just got plain weird afterwards, and I remember thinking, \"How in the hell did the Nitrous nazis get their tanks synced up like drums and space?\" as I tried to get some shut eye.\n\nAll in all, decent show, considering it was my last for over a year, although, not my choice. it was always easier to go from Deercreek to Buckeye, than it was the other way around.....",

      "review_text": "This show... I was at this show, my only experience with Grateful Dead and it was a true life changer for me. I went on a last minute whim, as a new friend of mine had tickets and was a big fan. (Anyone from The Recording Workshop in Chilicothe remember this???) I knew of the Dead's music but not much..I remembered seeing a bunch of Deadheads leaving a concert when I was a little kid and my dad's negative reaction to them...to be honest, they looked scary as a kid. But I was 22 now...I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I had recently did mushrooms for the first time, and we knew we could get more of everything there, so I went.\nBest move ever. I don't remember much about the concert itself, but I have been catching up on the Dead's music lately and always wanted to hear this show.\nanyway...I do remember it being freaky in the woods lol...I got some acid from somebody, and I was gone for a while...but most people were very cool to me, I made lots of new friends but hope I didn't bug out on anyone lol...pretty sure I passed out a few times, someone put a pair of 3d glasses on me and lit sparklers and started wavvying them around...tko lol. Folks were very cool, took care of me.\nI got lost from my friends, wandered around all night until the sun started to come up, and somehow miraclouly saw them waving at me from like waaaaaay across the park lol.. \nCan believe it took me this long to find this post! Thanks!!!!!!",

      "review_text": "Shakedowns Pollution I remember, being hungry for some 'escape' by the time we got in the show. The parking lot was a view of things to come and stay regarding 'shakedown'. Undercover cops in red bandana skull caps just grabbing as many heads as they could. China White was prevelant on the scene and behold the chopper makes an appearance on the lawn. They made a recording of Jerry's voice telling everyone to go home as we worked are way to the lot it was being broadcasted on loud speaker. I was very taken back by that. There was a big push for no overnight camping on the site but there was some really nice campgrounds in the area.\nThe show has some decent highlights like Birdsong which Jerry steers into some new different directions. A good '92 show is Copps Coliseum in Ontario. Buckeye in '91 w/ the Violent Femmes had some other good highlights and rare situations like when something was wrong w/ Jerry's amps and Bobby took over the guitar solo with his slide. Even on a bad night the Dead had some good jams surfacing.",
