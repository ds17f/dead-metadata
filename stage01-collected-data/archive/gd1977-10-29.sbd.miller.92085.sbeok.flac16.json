      "review_text": "One fan's opinion: Best Show Ever Yep. Uh-huh. This is it.\n\nCharlie Miller comes through again with a very essential upgrade to what this head feels is the Greatest Dead Show Ever Played. I expect no one to actually share that opinion, but I will lay out the case nevertheless.\n\nFirst, it's 1977, and the band is charging towards the end of their greatest year like a dam burst forth. May '77 has the best collective run of shows to be sure, with nary a clunker anywhere, but if you want that extra charge, that hard-driving rock & roll edge to go along with the perfect flow and practically ESP-like melding of minds that marked the May run, you need to dip your toes into the fall tour.\n\nAnd this show is the one that rules above all. \n\nWe begin with Jerry charging out of the gate with a vocal rendering of MIGHT AS WELL that says \"Hey, I'm here for some serious fun. You'd better be too.\" Flawless rendition (as is virtually every song on this night), and the rest of the gang joins in on the flurry of chorus repeats at the end. \n\nA scintillating JACK STRAW follows. Note if you will Bobby's own vocal commitment (perhaps not to be outdone by Jerry on the opener) when he holds the note on \"...not with aaaaaaaaalllllll.\" This is followed by simply the best bridge into \"Jack Straw from Witchita\" these ears have ever heard. Yes, there are longer jams, but I would argue none better in this version in terms of intensity, build up, and picture-perfect touch-down into that final verse. Not a note wasted and each one infused with runaway energy.\n\nDIRE WOLF fans...standard greatness here.\n\nLLR...My one complaint with this show, but only because I hate this song. Fans of it tell me this version is terrific, so if you fall in that category, you're all set.\n\nLOSER, EL PASO, RAMBLE, MINGLEWOOD, ROSES...all flawlessly rendered, great gritty guitar from Jerry...it's standardly wonderful '77 fare.\n\nLET IT GROW. Hang on, this is where things start to get hairy. Garcia rips it up, throwing in liberal hints of \"Spanish Jam\" and other fuzz-guitar madness...it all holds together under Bob's impassioned vocals and Donna does not get in the way. If not for 5/1/81 I'd call this the all-time best version. It certainly ranks in the Top 5.\n\nBERTHA. Oh, this Bertha. I hardly know where to start, but at the beginning: Listen to how Phil drops his bass notes one after the other in the opening notes, and how when he gets to the end it all rolls into one as the rest of the band jumps in at exactly the right moment to bring the chords into focus. The Garcia jams during the bridge reach new heights every time I listen...I simply cannot fathom how he was able to rip such ever-climbing notes into a coherent symphony of sound. It then passes seamlessly into an extraordinary GOOD LOVIN', also featuring rolling Phil bass lines and more monster jams by Jerry. \n\nFRIEND OF THE DEVIL. Just exactly perfect and Phil booms his bass at all the peak moments. \n\nESTIMATED is a Jerry Wah-Wah fest of the highest order...there are spacey elements to the post-lyrics jam that will mesmerize the mind, bringing us to a phenomenal, epic, jaw-dropping EYES OF THE WORLD. In the intro before a word is sung, we have Jerry channeling his inner Wes Montgomery. This is jazz guitar meshing perfectly in this Rock & Roll band. Note the ease and flow which marks this intro...nothing rushed; a beautiful up and down and all around journey that sets the tone, with almost no hint of the fury to come...It's lovingly sung...no flubs...and then we get the first jam break as Garcia teases with a crescendo that finishes perhaps a tad earlier then we expect...but it's a set-up for the next instrumental break, which busts open the gut of rock, jazz, psychedelia and more...Garcia rises, falls, rises again, and crashes it all down with band in tow into a frenzy of musical ecstasy that defines what the Grateful Dead were and what they meant to their fans. And then he steps up and sings \"Sometimes we live no particular way but our own\", and we know exactly what he means.\n\nHad enough? Please. A short SPACE,and it's time for a ST STEPHEN of raw blues power. Blues? Really? Hear for yourself. Listen to the oprning and tell me Garcia hasn't turned this late 60's acid tune into a gritty blues number. And it just takes off from there. Hard crashing drumming (it's at this point in the show that Mickey and Billy REALLY start to assert themselves), and again, flawless stuff charging headlong into a brief drumming stint and then a NOT FADE AWAY that rocks the house hard. \n\nNo wonder they had to bring it down a notch for a melancholy BLACK PETER. Except, ummm....no. This PETER is focused and intense and by the time Jerry implores all to \"Come run and seeeee...\" we're all wailing at the wall of a tortured soul.\n\nBut Bobby refuses to end the night on a down note, and Mickey and Billy have their own plans for a scorching SUGAR MAG.  (Caveat: Most SBD versions feature an edited version--expertly done, but an edit still...we jump right from verse one to \"Sometimes when the cuckoo's cryin'\") but that should not deter you.\n*** And, as it turns out, this excellent Miller upgrade includes a patch so you get the FULL Magnolia. Accept nothing less.***\n\nThis just jams and wails and rocks and if that wasn't enough the rhythm devils go ballistic on an impromptu drum roll at the end--neither one wanting to be the last to beat the skins...by the time SSDD begins, you can actually hear Weir laughing at what they've done. They've given it their all, and the SSDD keeps a movin'.\n\nA lot of SBDs don't contain the SAT. NIGHT encore. (This one does). But I could care less. If you're not breathless by the end of this masterpiece you're hard to impress. \n\nThis incredible show should be enshrined in history. It is my favorite Dead show of all time, and even if you do not agree, I am willing to bet dollars to Dead Donuts it will fall somewhere in your Top 10. \n\nEnjoy.",

You can bet that dozens of people, maybe even hundreds, hold this one as their all-time favorite. And it's a great show. The best of '77? Who can argue against it? Certainly not I. This here's a beauty, apart from the glitches, it's almost pefect, and yes, that Jack Straw bridge is smokin', and the Black Peter is sublime. But for me it's an A-, maybe even a B+. Why? Who the heck knows. A certain time, a certain place, a certain mood, you get what you bring. Right? It's silly to compare shows on this remarkable run.

Jerry and Donna were walking around campus before the show looking happy and content.  \n\nThe story I heard (from someone in the student association) was that the tickets were set at $12.50.  The Dead came into town and said that they would not play at that price but would be happy to play if the ticket prices were lowered to $7.50.  The box office closed (this was the day before) and reopened the day of the show with new tickets.\n\nI was in the top row of the bleachers...as far away from the stage as possible.  They were rocking so hard that I reached up to make sure I could hang on to the rafters in case the bleachers collapsed.\n\nAt the beginning of every set I heard from then on--hundreds--I would yell out \"Might As Well!\" Never heard it again.\n\nTalked with Dick years later and suggested this show.  He told me later that he couldn't find recording that was good enough to release.\n\nI once had an opportunity to ask Phil what was going on in 1977.  He knew just what I was asking.  He said he didn't know why, but agreed that 1977 had the best shows.",

Let It Grow is a masterpiece in itself. The magic continues for the second set. One of my favorite versions of Eyes Of The World. Jerry and Phil both got the slow groove goin nice. Both of them are just spittin out guitar & bass licks that sound incredible. St. Stephen starts off at a nice slow pace and by the end they've picked it up full steam. The space jam and Drums/bass jam are somewhat of a treat for a 77 show. Not Fade Away is hot like usual and leads into a beautiful Black Peter. One of my top 10 all time favorite shows.",

      "review_text": "Good either way <br />There are enough good reviews here to suffice as introduction to what many list in their top ten for the year. There are too many great shows in '77 for me to say it's top 10 (Colgate, just a few shows later is probably the best show of the tour). I see why some dig it, and it's certainly the reason Deadheads have heard of DeKalb. It was one of the first '77 Bettys to disperse after Barton and Colgate and Englishtown and the quality is as astounding as the playing, which made it notable in the days before the archive and the accumulation of official releases. Donna is good for most of this show, but the way some people talked, when I revisited this show I was expecting it to be as tight as a Spring '77. It's not, but no matter - the vibe is different than that tour anyway. It doesn't have best-of-77 highlights as much as it's evenly above average. I once met a cat that was at this show and explained special it was (I was on a student council that booked a tiny Talking Heads show, so I can dig it), years before I heard it. While many rate the Betty (which is fine), I prefer comparing shows. For Fall '77 it's top 5 but for the year it's maybe top 20, and good either way.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Might as Well</i> ain't bad at all but the next few are not the tightest. <i>Jack Straw</i> has shaky Donna and out of tune guitars and <i>Dire Wolf</i> is a little off for a '77. It all takes off for a standout <i>Loser</i> - perfection! The rest is hot with a unique and entertaining <i>Minglewood</i> (Jer going off and Keith  employing weird buzzing) and a <i>Let it Grow</i> that starts okay but enters a brilliant jam.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Bertha</i> is a good, if casual stroll. <i>Good Lovin'</i> is a bit sloppy; things turning around on a major <i>Friend of the Devil</i> with really nice work from Phil, Jer, everybody - including Donna. <i>Estimated</i> isn't the level of most 77s until the last few minutes (Keith's tone for this show is going to be a deal-breaker for many) but <i>Eyes</i> settle into a major, exploratory, 77-funk groove. Check the drummers. <i>Saint Stephen</i> is in the slow grind stylee and is fine, if they never completely get on top of it until the jam. The drummers start NFA, then veer into rudimentaries before Phil joins and steers them to free jazz. Again it's the very end of the jam of <i>Not Fade Away</i> where things gel. Though very basic, Jer's slide work for <i>Black Peter</i> is emotive and perfect for the song; again it's the last minute that's remarkable. It's been Jer's show, carrying the drummers and Bobby in places, which is the case again on the last two songs.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0 B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u00be Stars\n\nHighlights:\nLoser - matched only by 6/9 \nRamble on Rose - the quick, bouncy '77 stylee with amazing solo\nMinglewood Blues - typical awesome '77 with buzzing Keith craziness\nLet it Grow - Jer takes it and runs with crazy good stuff bursting in groups\nFriend of the Devil - dynamic\nEyes of the World - sink down into the cushion\n\nSOURCES: The miller.92085 is the upgrade and perfectly patches the gaps that used to circulate (we need those steenking patcheez). The mix is among Betty's finest, which really makes the show stand out.",
