Ah yes the only Morning Dew of 79' the sound quality is great, one of my favorite Phil dew's, just that crisp powerful bass and Jerry sounds so very passionate, vocals and six string (I love the ending) and correct me if i'm wrong but it's the only Dew i've heard that has a little reggae chop coming out of the first jam...SO SWEET!!!! peace.",

      "review_text": "weak Scarlet, interesting Morning Dew, great sound Thanks to the other reviewers here, I've listened to MDew, and upgraded this show from a 3 to a 4 (I view 10-27 and -28 as 5s). Not a memorable Scarlet, and not much of a jam coming out into Fire.  But the sound quality is high.  \n\nMorning Dew.  Lesh is very loud, and all over this thing.  We get a nice trill from Jerry after 6:30, and at 7:00, yes, we get the reggae'd chorus (probably occasioned by Garcia's failure to end the prior jam on cue...but they take his leftover stubbled notes and just go with the flow).  \n\nWhen they get to the \"I guess it doesn't matter\" refrain, they do it differently (maybe because it's been a year).  Instead of singing it quietly, and then taking the music/jam down to where a pin will drop, they rock it out and keep on going.  Unfortunately, it resulted in a shorter than normal jam; about 9:10 we get some nice trilling from Garcia, but at 9:36 he sings the final \"doesn't matter\" and they are done.",

Phil is all over this recording dropping bombs like he was piloting a B-52.  A lot has already been written about the Dew from this show, so I will refrain from doing so other than to say that there were not many Dews in this era and this is a good one.   \n\nI will, however, respectfully disagree with the reviewer who called the Scarlet \"weak.\"  I've always loved this Scarlet>Fire precisely because of Phil's booming presence everywhere.  This is a very hot show and well worth checking out.  It's only 2 discs too.",

      "review_text": "Hottest DEW Ever! This show is one of my faves and has been in my rotation for a while since I downloaded it last year. I agree with the mixed sentiments about the scarlet fire, which  does not come in until the second verse of scarlet- so the intro is cut- even then, which is unlike me, I odwnloaded it and it rocks. \n\nWhat is special about this DEW is two things:\n\n1. Its rare\n2. Jerry is on fire!\n\n DEW had not been played for 19 months since 4.15.78 and was the only DEW of '79, not to be played again until mid 1980 and only 4 times in 1980, then 5 times in '81 and forever after a rarity on tour except in '87 where it was played almost 20 times. Prior to 4.15.78 DEW was played 5 times in '77-much to my suprise- thanks deadbase.  It was played 3 times in 1976 and then 5 times in 1974. So from jan 1 1974 to jan 1 1982 DEW was played 22 times. \n\nThis Dew was only the 9th DEW in 5 years so it was indeed quite rare and Jerry really belts it out with major emotion- any deadhead will feel the outrageous power in his voice as he screams these lyrics at the top of his lungs- the crowd is waaay into it. The ending of DEW is unique since Jerry sort of adlibs \"I guess it doesn't matter, anyway\" 4 times then shreds into a jam that at the very least sends chills up my spine. \n\nOn top of all this, the NFA rocks and the DEW is a major suprise!\n\nThis is a MUST have. 5 stars even though some tapes do soundbetter, this is crisp and kind.",

I advise those who enjoy this show to find that other one made available to us by Charlie Miller, the Archive's Sound God.\n\nThe sound here is good, not perfect: 4 skulls\nThere are some other factors that keep this show/recording source from getting anything higher than 4 even though this is a great show. In the notes:<i>\n- The first few seconds of Minglewood Blues is missing\n- Some digi-noise at the beginning of the audience cheering at the end of Stagger Lee\n- The first few verses of It's All Over Now are probably missing\n- Scarlet Begonias cuts in at: she had rings on her fingers ....\"\n</i>In spite of these somewhat minor blemishes, I absolutely love this concert but be advised that I am a big fan of 1979 in general. The Scarlet~Fire may not be the very best ever but it is a sweet one. Jerry and Phil are rock stars in FOTM. Then, it's Bobby and Brent's turn to get into the act with a solid if rudimentary Sailor~Saint. The obligatory yet interesting Drums~Space follows and then a wicked synth into for NFA sets the stage for a rockin' version of that classic. Phil bombastic notes birth Morning Dew into existence and the rest is history.\nI hope to see Charlie Miller get the upgrade for this second set to us in the near future!",

Its unique (in the aspect that it has few other dews surrounding it). Phil is dropping mad bombs, and everyone else is kicking ass. When i am in need of the intense dead to just get me off or make me forget about the world, this one gets cranked. I've tried breaking my car speakers playing this one full volume but came up short.

The whole night had a strange vibe to it. the second set was short but very intense - the st stephen tussle was pretty intense and the morning dew blew me away. garcia mixed up the verses and played the last version with a reggae lilt. no quiet bit at the end - straight to power chords - this version is quite unique - today is the first time I've heard it since the show and I remember it well AND garcia was wearing white pants this night, which I thought was weird at the time - they could have been the pants from the GO TO HEAVEN shoot.

Barely six months into his tenure with the band his playing  is masterful. The boys hit it out of the park when they tapped him for the job. No one else could have filled those shoes so effectively IMO. Not the best sounding board here but the only \"complete\" one. I don't fault the band for protecting their livelihood.

I gave it a listen and it seemed to me, this was never before rehearsed with Brent. In the intro, he is almost non existent and would come in gradually with some subtle B3. As it got to the middle break, he's picking it up and getting a little more aggressive and then he kind of holds the note at the end of the break, which made the transition a bit off. But then comes back strong again at the end. I've always loved Brent on Dew, some of his best supporting B3 work.",

A very nice show at the Cap Centre. Then in \u201878 I returned home from college to see them over Thanksgiving break, a 14-hour one-way bus trip. Well worth it.\n\nThis \u201879 show was different. Some people I met at college gave me one of their 14th row tickets. Just the odds of randomly running into them at the show were crazy high. I would never see them again. The first set was a bit slow but memorable. The second set was sweet. When they broke into Morning Dew, I was ecstatic, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel it would be the end of the era of live Dead shows for me, at least for the foreseeable future. It had that vibe of finality as Jerry ran through those riffs at the end. \n\nIt did turn out to be my last Dead show. It was a short three show run but most memorable. I learned a lot over the six year period. It has served me well over all my years combined. But the \u201878 show will always stand out for me. That was one wild night. ",
