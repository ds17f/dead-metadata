After the mad dash for the all-general admission seating (a tsunami of Guatemalan clothes and patchouli if there ever was one), speculation immediately began about a small drum kit, acoustic guitar and bass up on stage in front of the Dead's gear.  Eventually, someone came out and announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the Violent Femmes.\"  The Femmes popped out and played a surprise, dynamite 45-minute set that had all of us pogoing along.  And just off of stage left stood Bruce, Mickey and his son laughing their asses off for the entire set.",

The more I listen to this era the more I realize that Bruce's contributions to the more focused first set tunes was greater than the stretched out jams typical of set 2 where the 'structure' of handing off leads was less prevalant.  All that said, great first set punctuated by the aforementioned.\n\nSet 2 has a nice fingers>playin>he's gone trio, weir steps on the into into O1 and the cut intro to Wharf Rat causes a slight downgrade.\n\nIt's really 3.5, but I'll round up to 4.  Other summer shows worth your time are 6/17 (creme de la creme) 6/20 and 6/22.",

There was also a shirless freaky dude playing what looked like a childs plastic guitar.  He was singing some evil sounding tune and licking his guitar every so often.

Sold Labatts blue on left side of hill in parking lot.  I too came down from Buffalo with girlfriend and a very seasoned DeadHead, Tom.  Sonic Garden, hell heah.  Use to see em at Broadway Joes along with the Crumbs of Insanity.  I might know how you were?  Did you eber catch the Infediels?  They use to play in our big basement on Elmwood Ave.  It was out of control.\n\nBack to this show.  One of the better Playin's I heard during summer.  The Rueben was sweet as was the Sugaree and Let It Grow 1st set.\n\nWish I could remember a bit more, enough of my ramblings\nDownload this show and enjoy the Grateful Dead~",

Rubin & Cherise was hot as well as Sampson.  I still get the chills from that he's gone.  Buckeye left me with a huge smile and a Bad Sunburn",

      "review_text": "kinda ho hum awesome venue! expansive with trees and woods on the inside of the venue. Was there in 91' and 92'. This was certainly better than the show here in 92'.\nLots of happy trippy people frolicking about!\nmany great sounding sources of this out there. Highlights for me were the Femmes, Sugaree(Jerry does some crazy fanning at the end of this tune), Minglewood(Bobby nails the Buckeye fillies parts), the Rubin(shame they couldn't have explored this tune greater than what they did), Let it Grow(played nearly flawlessly), He's Gone(mellow & sublime), Wharf Rat(interesting rendition), Around & Around(rockin' foot stompin'///I remember dancing fiercely towards the end of the tune. Very fun show\ngreat fun at this show  ~~ music only 3.5 out 5 stars though. Because of the scene inside the show prior to the Dead coming on.(trippy scene & the Femmes opening) is enough to sway on the side of 4 stars. Certainly not the best show of 91' but I have fond memories of this show and for musical content it blows 92's Buckeye Lake show out of the water.",

      "review_text": "super fun show what a dandy! i remember being bummed by the picasso opener, but surprised at how good weir sounded. man, he was really tight that entire summer tour! picasso, minglewood, masterpiece (! - GO BOB) and let it grow all sound great in the first.\n\njerry's guitar is down in the mix for the first three tunes. i don't think that's just this board mix -- i recall that at the venue too. bob seems aware of this and steps it up a bit (as does bruce), but jerry busts out the midi and comes roaring back for RoR. this was such a great go-to song for jerry in this period.\n\njerry's vocals are strong throughout the entire show, which was not always the case during this era. this is also the best (and last) reuben they ever did (out of four total). what a treat.\n\nand what a second set! a strong samson, crazy fingers sets up a great playin -> he's gone segment. holy moly! good stuff. i love how the other one drops into wharf rat.\n\nthis is really among the top shows of the era. i find it hard to assign five stars to any of these, however, so let's say 4.5",

After a trippy ride through towns like \"knockemstiff\" ( no lie) we got to the mound and thousands of cicadas had just molted and the place was buzzing.  We said our prayers and made it to Buckeye with enough time to hit shakedown, take care of business and frolic in the heat.  Just then we hear the sound of the Femmes and its find the gate thyme!  - Like a blister in the sun! In Oregon I've seen folks playing piano in the woods at the Oregon Country Fair and I knew I've seen that before...thanks for stirring up the memories folks. Those Cicadas came back 17 years later in 2008...and return in 2025!  And the music never stops....",

Traded a extra ticket for a 1/4 of mushrooms\u2026.. going good before the Violent Femmes even started. Haha. They rocked a 45 min set from what I can remember\u2026. very close to album quality. I grew up listening to them so it was a cool surprise when they opened. A lot of the older heads were over it before they even started. There's always that handful of purist who were never satisfied or could always find something wrong. All in all a pretty good show and certainly a FUN one!

      "review_text": "S of a HG I was surprised there were as many highlights in this show since I've never heard it get much mention, aside from the <i>Rubin & Cherise</i> being an Easter Egg on the <b>View from the Vault II</b> DVD. It's one of the best '91 shows and since 3/31, 10/31, 9/10, 4/28 & 6/28 are often the ones cited, this one is something of a hidden gem.\n\nThis was their second time at Legend Valley (there is no \"valley\" though it formerly wasn't on a \"lake\" either). The songlist of the big 1:45 2nd set doesn't necessarily impress so it's great when this band proves a list irrelevant - when a \"bathroom song\" got wild, out there or beautiful and your hive said, sold! But with heat index in the triple digits I'm glad I missed this one. Speaking of the sun, Violent Femmes opened. The 1st LP's a classic and Gano & Ritchie were always great . I'm surprised to see  they've reformed (given that they sued each other). I'm high as a kite and I just might stop to check you out. Let me go on like I blister in the sun.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Picasso Moon</i> picks right up and tightens, followed by a monster-jam version of <i>Sugaree</i>. Sometimes Vince was puzzling and sometimes this good; and check Bobby - making up for the slide playing on <i>Minglewood</i> (Buckeye Fillies). His fills are cool on <i>Ramble</i>, however. This was the final <i>Rubin & Cherise</i>, as somebody didn't like it - erm, we're looking at you, Phil. It's okay but Orlando is the hot one (as already pointed out by cb18201). The playing is good on <i>Let It Grow</i> but I'm not big on Bobby's approach.\n\nSecond Set. Bang. <i>Samson</i> in a crazy ensemble version with everybody wrestling. THIS is what they sounded like in spring' 91 with Vince, when achieving levitation (the odd mix is the same on the AUDs). The machine powers through to a perfect tranny into <i>Playin'</i> and Bobby plays quite differently on <i>He's Gone</i> - his era of starchy chords  and tremolo harmonics. Bruce is great because he's choosy. Check the brief Spoonful tease. It's a 32min jam into <i>Drums</i> and one of the top sequences of '91, as other commenters have noted. In <i>Space</i>, Jer quotes Bach's <i>Herz und Mund und Tat und  Leben</i>. Specifically, the cantata's Movement 10 for chorale (the section  that was rewritten for piano in the 20th century under the nonsensical title \"Jesus Joy of  \tMan's Desiring\", and which my little brother called \"The Jesus of Mayonnaise\"). Listen to <i>Wharf Rat</i> and you'll see Bobby's just having a great set, on his Casio Blacknife with his new Floyd Rose floating bridge (and able to stay in tune, whammies-in flocks of birds). They start sounding tired and off by <i>Around & Around</i> and while odds are somebody somewhere likes Bruce on accordion for <i>Knockin'</i>...  I posit it's based on whether the tonality is a dead fit - I liked it more in person than archivally. Granted this is probably the best song for such  wheezings and the pacing is much better than it would be a few years later.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall = 4 stars\n\n<i>Highlights</i>:\nSamson & Delilah>Crazy Fingers>Playing in the Band>He's Gone>Drums - Great ensemble playing and segues. Bobby's the glue.\n\nSOURCES: The dusborne is a crazy-but-good 3-source matrix (usually you can't keep a triple in phase). It beats the SBD for depth and image, but the balance is off in places and it lacks the crispness and clarity. Of the SBDs, unknown.12756 is preferred as the least boomy. There is a  glitch@11:27 in Drums and Space  has a  fade out/in @2:11. \"He's Gone>Jam>Drums>Space>TOO\" should be labeled \"He's Gone>Drums>Space >Space contd>TOO\".",
