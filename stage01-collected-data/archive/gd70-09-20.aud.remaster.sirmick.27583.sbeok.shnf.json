The cds that I had before had a good amount of hiss and the later part of the electric set sounded very degraded.  This fixes all of that (except for some volume fluxuation durin the later part of Caution - which is not nearly as distracting as it was before) and makes it as it should be.  The acoustic set is the all time best ever and the electric set just smokes.\nThrow away your old copies of this show and dowload this now!!  I cannot say enough good things about the show and the improvement this remaster represents.  If you've been waiting for this show to be released (I had been since I first heard just the acoustic set years ago), wait no longer!!\nThank you so much for those who undertook this labor of love.

The version on that show is the other definitive version. ;)\n\nWhile 9/18/74 is pretty darn great all the way through, I would have to say that 9/20/70 includes more of the best versions of songs.\n\nFunny story about listening to this show with a guy who I shall refer to as \"Mr. Deadhead.\"  This guy gave me a lot of tapes and really thought he was the shit.  In a way, he was the shit.  So we're listening to this show and during the *first* guitar solo on Easy Wind, I say, \"Man, listen to Bobby rip it up!\"  And Mr. Deadhead says: \"That's Jerry.\"  \n\nTry to believe it, folks.  This guy bragged about his tape collection non-stop and he couldn't even tell the difference between Jerry and Bobby.\n\nThis is one of a handful of shows that is perfect for introducing the young freak to the strange impossible sound of Bob Weir's guitar playing.  China/Rider and Easy Wind especially.  The recording and separation of the guitars is perfect.  And Bobby is down in the friggin' dirt with the distortion.  Is that a Telecaster or a Gibson SG?  Someone who knows needs to tell us.\n\nOther cool stuff: listen to the great percussion and Pig's beautiful organ playing in Me and My Uncle!\n\n\n*Just noticed I hadn't added a comment about this in last four years, but I've listened to it probably a hundred times since then.  A great part of what makes it about this recording is the analog nature of the source material ... including the occasionally warbling, drop-outs, etc.  It's still a fascinating mix and reminds us of all that is lost from this incredible year thanks to Bear's imprisonment etc.",

The whole first set is definitely worth listening too. (In Order). A very rare early acoustic truckin\u2019 is great and the ripple and dark hollow are too; (wish i was there) for this first set alone. But what brings this whole together in the second set is the amazing easy wind arguably one of the best ever. and what makes it so amazing is the way bobby dosen\u2019t disappoint his leads are amazing and you feel like him and jerry are in a duel with each other, but as worthy of an opponent as jerry is bobby undoubtedly holds his own. The whole show is phenomenal and in great quality for 1970. The mandolis\u2019t in the acoustic is said to be mr. David Grisman but arguable. The keys in the acoustic set too are great pig could sing and boy could he play that thing like his life depended on it. One of the funkiest sugar mag\u2019s iv\u2019e reviewed so far. Jerry's guitar has such a great distortion on that amazing sugar magnolia and boy were they on that faithful night. The not fade away is ripping and love the going down the road feeling band type jam towards the end which then you hear phil suggest a caution witch then happens after to a great extended we bid you goodnight, which i love personally short sweet song. truly a great Fillmore concert and a definite must have for the acoustic dead lover. Definitely one of the best the dead had to offer in September 1970. And imagine the audience got all this for $5.00 bucks!\n\n\n\nWant to Trade Shows? \n Balaw28@gmail.com - i got them if you got the ones im missing or just need it.  And well you need this one!!",

They begin to show the fruit of growth and maturity as musicians.  They still have Pigpen, which gives them a dynamic obviously missed upon his departure from us.\n\nBig RR Blues & Speedway are definite spotlights in a 1st set of highlights.  2nd set was killer as well with an awesome rendition of China Cat, Sitting on top of the world is off the hook, and Smags is truly alive with Jerry's distortion.\n\nI really like this show all around, they have few mess ups (the first verse of Trukin' is all I recall) and the band sounds raw, alive, energized, and eager to play.\n\nTo me, this show is a must have and a part of a beginning, or ending, or just a door they went through from which they never returned.

I remember the light show (Josh White I am pretty sure) which included some hilarious cartoons and some other pretty weird stuff going on.  This was my third or forth FE show and I my memory of which night was which is a bit vague.  I have ticket for this show, so no vagueness there.  Thank you all who taped this show and worked on the tapes.  It was all I could do to find the right train to get to the Fillmore!\n\nI just want to try and clear something up - we watched in awe as jerry played the piano on To Lay Me Down.  This was my last of many FE and Port Chester shows and most had big acoustic sets - but never had we ever seen JG tickle the ivorys. You do not forget that!  BTW today I toggled back and forth between Harpur college acoustic set and this one. Both are superb but this one tops because of Phil being on bass (there is no bass track on Harpur) and the additions of the mandolins. To my ear both Grisman and Nemson take turns filling in with mandolin. Grisman is unquestionably playing on ripple.",

Probably under ten times... This bluegrass Big Railroad is also pretty heady. David Nelson's mado contribution is fitting (it's 1970) and a nice addition. While the Truckin' kind of sounds like the studio cut, its still a unique change to hear it acoustic, with crisp and bare vocals. I wonder who is playing piano. Maybe Pig, but i'm not sure. Not TC or Keith, so who?? (anyone know). Oh yeah, and that acoustic Brokedown, a little raw and in its baby form but still so perfect. Those who were their are eternally Grateful, and those who can listen for free are as well. Thanks for re-mastering this dusty tape and giving us these rare acoustic gems that make this set up there with the likes of 1970-5-2 and 15. Never more soulful or devoted. Electric Dead might have made them the raging party that so many heads loved, but the sprit of the band lies within these moments. \n\nOh yeah, the electric material is also well done, with some nice throw in's (Big Boy Pete, Attics).

Major Props to the fellows who remastered the soundboard recording. There are a few glitches in the electric set, for sure, but all in all it captures very well one of the 1970 run of great east coast shoes, six of which I attended, including 4 at the Fillmore, and a very special one at the Capitol Theater, June 24, of which there is no soundboard recording, unfortunately. People who missed these 1970 shows, or haven't listened to credible recordings of them,can't possible understand how absolutely special the atmosphere was and intimate the relationship was between the band and the audience, or, of course, how sensationally they they played.",

Very nice but I'm more more interested in the electric jamming side of things. And that's where this show falls short. The mix is often weird, with Bobby way loud and Jerry very quiet, most of the vocals come out of the right speaker and then there is lots of tape damage. There's some nasty muffled distortion coupled with muffled oscillating sound that pretty much runs throughout Caution which otherwise is a good version. Overall the playing by the Dead is good, Bobby especially and you can really hear him because of the f-ed up mix, but nothing revelatory or really mind bending occurs. It's a good show, not a great one. The energy is middling. If you want to hear shows that destroy this one in playing and sound I suggest the Fillmore East shows from January second and third and of course Feb 11, 13, 14. 5/15 is also very good.",

They pulled it out in 70 and 80 and perhaps it would have come around again if Brent had not passed.\nI got to see Garcia acoustic a few times and he was great.\nJerry had the intimacy thing down and could connect with an audience during an acoustic set. (of course he could do that in an 80,000 seater as well) For a while I was concerned about if I should get more selective with my ratings but I got to tell you i really enjoy the music and if anything i feel like i under rate shows from 1980 on.\nI give just about everything with good sound quality 4 to 5 stars because this band was above average almost every night they played. That is why I followed them from city to city. I really enjoyed their music. Now that I get to listen to so many great shows with PRISTINE SOUND yes, I have become more selective as far as sound quality goes but i appreciate the music this band made. Yes it can be interesting to get reviews that really get deep into how the band is performing but at the end of the day. My litmus test is do I get off on the show? Does it work? I am a Christian and I listen to much Christian music and I just would like for a Christian band to come along that was bible sound and could jam. I do recommend Hillsong United the sister (Taya) in that band who does their lead vocals is a modern day Janis Joplin as far as lead vocals go.",

I have a new favorite Brokedown, he has a new favorite Deep Elem. Big Boy Pete was jumpin'. I never heard that song before and I loved it. I just found this show so I don't know what the previous audio sounded like but thanks to whoever cleaned it up. I thought it sounded pretty damn good. The reviews that are on here (and other recordings on this site) have taught me more about The Dead than maybe anywhere else. I didn't really grow up listening to a lot of Dead. In Philadelphia we thankfully had Pierre Robert or I may have never heard more than Truckin' and Touch of Grey. Between this site and Spotify, I have really been able to get to hear a wide selection of Dead all day if I want and I want more often than not. To quote Mr. Robert, \"God Bless The Grateful Dead\"!

      "review_text": "The stuff of legend. I (kind of) remember tripping heavily one afternoon in college on two or three pure white-on-white tabs, with just enough mental wherewithal left during the come-up to pop this show into the CD player. Electric Dead would\u2019ve been too intense, I reasoned, and surely something acoustic would help me relax and enjoy the doses. I\u2019m not sure how much of the show I made it through, but I do remember the Deep Elem Blues kicking my stoned ass, with tons of tension, and Jerry\u2019s vocals swinging in and out of focus against a chopping, against-the-grain groove from Bob and Mickey. I remember watching my speakers seemingly shifting and contorting, spilling out the music, with the wall behind them dripping against the green and purple acid-induced muck that was filling my field of vision. When it started to sound like Garcia was singing backwards in another language, I knew I was in for a ride. That\u2019s the last thing I remember.\n\nFast forward several years, I selected this one for the long ride home from the last ever Dead & Company shows at SPAC, the perfect musical accompaniment for a sunny Monday drive through the counties of Saratoga and Montgomery. The rest of the world was at work, and I was beaming with that post-show glow, enjoying a Canadian road soda and a great view of the land of farms, horses, and forests. Even as far west as the Chittenango Travel Plaza, the upstate and midwest deadhead hoards were swarming home. There must\u2019ve been a dozen tie-dyes piling towards the bewildered Chic-fil-A staff. This time around, I was able to dial into 9/20/70 with more focus and sobriety, and now feel that I can give a more thorough assessment of its overall quality.\n\nFrom the opening notes of the robust, majestic Uncle John\u2019s Band, you can tell it\u2019s unique. Even by 1970 standards, there\u2019s nothing like this. This isn\u2019t just the usual \u201870 acoustic duo of Bob and Jerry. Phil\u2019s timbery bass, the shimmering cymbals, and rustic mandolin give this one a rosy backwoods flavor unmatched by any other acoustic set I\u2019ve heard. This is the American Beauty band, plucked from the studio and placed lovingly on the Fillmore East stage.\n\nWhen they finally plug in the electrics, it\u2019s a healthy balance of their brand new hits and fun covers that they\u2019d been doing since \u201866, like Sitting on Top of the World, Big Boy Pete, and Me and My Uncle. Easy Wind is filthy, while Sugar Magnolia is bright, jumpy, and still very fresh. Attics hits some incredibly emotional heights. The roaring 44-minute sequence of NFA > Caution > Feedback > Goodnight is as great as you\u2019d hope. It\u2019s the band of many styles: the country soul of Rosalie McFall and the hopping sizzle of China > Rider, the brisk, timeless colonial pride of Uncle John\u2019s Band and the slow, sly, hovering Candyman.\n\nMany years later, 9/20/70 continues to stand, and always will stand, as an absolutely legendary Dead show that lives up to the fanfare.",
