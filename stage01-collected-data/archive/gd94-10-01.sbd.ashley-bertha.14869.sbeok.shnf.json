I would have to disagree with the idea that this is not one of the top 10 or even 5 post brent shows- even though I am a HUGE hornsby fan I feel that this show is at the top of the list post brent regardless...The garden was ROCKING this evening and for the first time in my young (18) life I finally came in contact with 'IT'- and it changed my life. By contrast the sat night MSG show (the only other show i got into that fall) paled in comparison, as does nearly every show 92-95 IMO. Im sure it means more to me that I was there, but I also feel that this show stands on its own as the last TRULY magical night that the boys had before the passing of St.Jerome.Old schoolers sometimes lose sight of the fact that some of us were not blessed enough to have been born early enough to see anything but Vince shows, if that, and for us it is truly one of the most magical nights in GD history.So dont hate just cause we werent born yet- just my 2 cents....",

Ive just got to say that at 11:25 into the Scarlet track, Jerry starts doing this little MIDI flute thing, and right as Jerry starts to get cooking on it, Phil immediately starts RIPPING into the Fire bass line and Jerry INSTANTLY takes that little riff and weaves it into a variation on the Fire rythum (ala Cornell). its a split second thing, but you have to hear it. It will bring tears to your eyes. \n\nI know im being long-winded right now, but just FIND 11:25 on the Scarlet track and LISTEN, youll see what I mean....its very subtle, and only lasts from around 11:25 to 12:15, but its absolutely PRICELESS. The way Jerry and Phil are bouncing off each other is beautifull. Unfortunatley Welnick ruins it with that \"tinkle\" sound that drives me crazy....\n\nWhen I hear a little 20 second thing like that, it makes me realize how great Jerry really was....There are plenty of talented guitarists out there, but not many are as flexible and able to change gears on such short notice as Ole' Jerr was...\n\nI miss you man, sometimes I dream about you, and my 2 year old daughter is already dancing to View From the Vault Vols. 1-4!\n\nI'll never forget walking right past you one rainy day in the late 80's, near Grand Central Station in NYC, the street was fairly empty for that time of day and you were wearing a very stylish raincoat and were well groomed. I didnt say anything to you because you had a depressed look on your face. you looked sad. But i know in my heart it was you....you looked me right in the eyes....\n\nI came home to Queens later that evening and found out that JGB were playing that night at the Meadowlands....\n\ni miss you Ole Jerr'\nmay you forever be in gods arms......\n\n-hf",

      "review_text": "It's the singing of the song. Im surprised none of the reviews have mentioned Jerry's vocal performance in this show.  This show is a good dead show, for a solo vince show it's particulalry good at times even great.  Great set, good energy and preety tight.  For me what really makes this show, flubbed lyrics and all is the passion in Jerry's singing, particulalry on Fire(listen to the end), the Stella Blue, and my god the So Many Roads.  I always got the feeling that Jerry was the type of musician who wanted to vocally let it rip, but for whatever reasons (voice control, nerves) didn't.  Instead in those emotionally charged moments it seemed that he would turn to his guitar playing and that this would usually more than compensate.  In the songs I listed above, the opposite happened.  Not that Jerry's playing was weak, throughout this show there's some beautiful tender moments and some kick ass rocking.  Rather, his singing was just exceptional.  To me in terms of pure emotional wailing, I've never heard better. If someone has please let me know. The So Many Roads, is a great example of a song where in other versions it seems like vocally he's wanted to go farther, but didn't while in this version he's just singing with everything he has.  Give it a listen you'll hear what Im talking about.",

So elated to revisit this one now with a pristine copy for happy ears.\n\nTagging onto some of the previous comments, I fully concur that Jerry's vocals ripped during So Many Roads.  I get goosebumps listening to that song, especially at the end during the refrain, he lets it all go.  You can feel the band rising behind him as he hits his cresendo, vocals fully charged and energized.  There is some serious emotion being spewed during those precious few moments.  They just as forcefully as it swelled, it equally disappates into nearly quiet nothingness.  Shivers, man.\n\nAlso noteworthy are his vocals in Stella Blue - a very similar ending to that song takes the refrain into the stratosphere.\n\nBut for me, the real kickers this night were the Help/Slip/Franklin's opener and the Second Set Scarlet/Fire opener.  Franklin's is definitely up-tempo and giddy; the Scarlet/Fire is well played and the boys didnt hold back on the transition at all - no wimping out occurred.  I also really enjoy the midi-flute Jerry plays, although I wish he fiddled with it longer.  It's cool to hear them change it up and add that kind of variation to the transistion.  There is a great midi-flute Scarlet/Fire transition played during the '91 Halloween show - sweet indeed.",

      "review_text": "Hate to admit but it's a damn good show I have to preface and say that I'm an ardent NY'er.   And consequently, I have a prejudice against all things Boston-- and that extends to the comparison of Dead shows. But I have to say that the 10/1 Boston show is damn good show-- and arguably the best of '94.  The band is clearly \"on,\" and they're into it.  More significantly, I've done some side-by-side comparisons of the two infamous '94 Scarlet>Fires (10/1 Boston and 10/14 NYC) and, though it kills me to say it, I have to give a slight nod to the Boston version as better.  It's important to recognize that the 10/14 version is a rather uniquely sprawling landscape, with jagged peaks and valleys (including that explosive ending).  But the Boston version is cleaner, tighter, and features a beautiful MIDI flute solo by Jerry.  I don't agree with those who think Jerry noodled away parts of the 10/14 version; I think he's legitimately taking his time, and stretching out a bit (see his oblique, \"sliding\" notes during the big jam-- an approach he references again during the next song, LL Rain).  But the Boston version is even a bit sharper.  10/1/94 is also a better show than 3/30/94, and adds credence to the theory that the Dead (and Jerry in particular) were surprisingly coherent in Fall '94-- perhaps to make amends for the awful summer tour, or perhaps because Garcia was temporarily tending to his health.  In summary, if someone wanted to do a Dick's Pick for '94, it should be 10/1 (with any filler material grabbed from set one of 10/13-- everything from Loser through Let it Grow in that set is a lot of fun, and Dupree's is terrific).",

Jerry is passionate, Bob is right in the pocket, Phil is on top, Billy and Mickey are just all over it, and Vince is invincibly convincing. A triumphant declaration. So Many Roads   ~ exquisite. Scarlet Jerry bobs and weaves, explores so many crevices of the benign punching bag taking you out and reeling you back in, then a little farther out, then reel you back in. Into the fire out of the flame, into the fire out of the flame. Time cooking extravangance. Sometimes everybody assembled feels good at the same instant and you have these kinds of times. This is a time that shocks with its intensity, so much else of the surrounding year is considered negligence. Everbody is feeling too good in this one and I sense that it will prove to tax Jerry's endurance. You can hear him giving not only his all but something more. Provocative way to lead you home via once of total surprise and astonishment. Way to Go Home. It's a long way. It's a long long way to go back to your job and make it there in one piece. You're awake! Even in the depths of drowse you are awake, Saint! ...and\n\nSaint means \"A Sanctified One\" You are a sanctified one! Holes in the knees of your blues!\nBig slop out by Jerry indicating the rexless a-band-done but sensing he was adrift, happily adrift, happily so...and not caring about the consequences with the rain falling down let him float. Just let him float a crashing dodging red-blue terrapin. Waking up! Falling asleep. Waking up! Falling asleep. All golden.\n\nenter: the drums into space causing me to instantly recall all the Geometry I missed in the tenth grade. This is an uncle at a family reunion whom you initially despise but end up liking. Whistling into the grief shrouds, effervescing. Strategic freezing. Whistling it goes past wielding its holy decibel. Saying: This could be the last time. It whistles itself into Stella Blue\ntakes a deep breath. Jerry goes all out ad-libbing \nmany additional repeatings. And as he cries you can hear right down into the very substance of all that he was.\n\nAbsolutely superb show. As last gasp effort with the Grateful Dead for Jerry he gave it all he had and more on this night. This was a final hurrah.\nA sweet swan song all purple and gold the way you like it.\n\nHe found his own way home.\nHe found his own way home.",

But this show has great jamming, few vocal flubs, and Jerry is mentally and physically present with the rest of the Dead.\n\nHighlights in my mind include a high-energy Franklins after a bumpy Help>Slip. The So Many Roads is one of the best, if not the best i have ever heard. Granted i'm not as varied in mid 90s dead, but this version sounds stellar. Great backup and lead vocals, no mistakes, sounds like G-Dead perfection. What an inspiring song, when done right. Many people regard this song as one of the only positive moments of the last show. Here this version shines as well. The Terrapin>Jam>Drums is sweet too. The instrumentals are on point and not mistake ridden. \n\nIt's sad that we have these few here-and-there shows from this period to pick apart, but i have to give this one a positive review, since it makes me smile to hear energy and effort in, at this point, a troubled scene and troubled band.",

I've only been a Deadhead about a year now so 1994-1995 are the 2 years I've heard nothing of (I actually like a lot of shows in '92 & '93), this is the first and the Scarlet>Fire is easily the highlight of the show, but this is also the best version of So Many Roads I've heard in the later years.

Everything in the first set is played tight and with a lot of energy.  Vince's playing is really nice without the too high in the mix annoying tinkling toy piano sound that he often used.  Very tasteful.  I don't know why Jerry's playing and energy are so much greater in this particular show compared to some pretty uninspired, dismal performances throughout the rest of the year up to that point. Perhaps he was aware that this would be the last music ever played in that building.  Who knows?  By any measure, any era, that first set smokes.  Often in this era, a solid first set would be followed by a letdown in the second.  Not on this night.  For the naysayers, of this show and others, I think Way To Go Home was written for you.  The recording and remaster version heard here is excellent.  Very good balance between all the instruments.  You can easily pick out any instrument in the mix.  Any time someone is critical of the late period, this is the first show I use as an exception to that rule.  A great show was not a regular occurrence in '94-'95.  In fact, it was rare.  But, if you are a Deadhead, this show can't be denied. Certainly one of the best, if not the best of the post-Brent shows.",
