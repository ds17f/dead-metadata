      "review_text": "The Dead Themselves Said this Show Sucked This is not to dis those who liked the show, but I kid you not. A buddy of mine took the Washington DC shuttle to NYC on the day after the Cole Field show, and ran smack into the Dead at the final gate. It took him a few seconds to process what he was seeing, but there they were, standing on line and waiting to board. He had to say something so he said what any Deadhead would say. To Bob and Brent he said, \"Great show last night!\" They laughed. Nahh, they said. \"Bad set. That was a baad set. We just didn't have it.\" Words to that effect. They couldn't have been more unequivocal about it. \nI always found this fascinating because I was at the show too and I sure didn't think it was a bad set. Then again, I was an 18-year-old starry-eyed Deadhead who knew a good show from a great show but not necessarily that the Dead could ever truly play a bad set. But even though the band was not happy with its performance that night, that isn't the end-all. John Lennon denounced some of his classic Beatles stuff, for example. But I must say that the band's own assessment of this show--and I'm sure they'd say the same thing about lots of shows--provides some much-needed perspective. I mean, come on, sometimes the guys just didn't have it. This is one of those nights, at least according to the men who played it.",

This is the famous \"pushed Phil down the stairs\" incident he always referred to (see \"The Grateful Dead Movie\" for a clip of this interview).  \n\nJerry said that he thought the \"music was fucked\" and that \"everything was a struggle\".  He then chuckles about how, when they listened to tapes of the shows months later, the shows were \"crackling with energy\" and the band used them on their next album (I believe it was Anthem of the Sun).  He finishes by musing that this was when the band learned not to judge their performance by how they felt about it afterwards.\n\nI hate to have to state the obvious, but if you  never heard this before, you haven't been paying very close attention to the band.  Here's a tip, listen to the show to find out if its good.  Don't say its a good show because you had a \"great time\".

Mostly they did not seem as one band, or even soloists ringing their stuff out, but rather as a band seemingly thinking of the next stop along the way.

You can clearly hear Jerry playing with the echo during Alabama and it's not as painful when you listen with that info.\n\nDuring the Jam after Saint, I did not hear the Eleven but did hear extended Saint jam, perhaps a bar of Heaven Help the Fool, and certainly Uncle John's, which they played the next show.  Terrapin Station would have been perfect in that spot since Cole Field House was the home of the Terrapins at that time.  But back in '81, Phil would come out on stage early by himself to check his equipment.  That night, some buttheads in the front told Phil how they \"had to play Terrapin that night\" and that basically killed any chance that they might.\n\nAnd yes, I remember the house lights coming up during Deal, maybe a couple times.  They also did at Hampton a couple months later.  At the time, we thought it was because the set was nearing the 90 minute mark and the sound team wanted to let Jerry know that the tape was going to run out!  But this is speculation.",

Bird Song featured those interesting synth-guitar noodlings: and I have a vivid memory of Looks Like Rain stretching on, with Garcia laying little flashing notes over Weir's repetitive vocals.  The stage was bathed in blue light, and roses were being tossed over Bobby from behind the stage.",

The did play a long interesting Bird Song that night, but this show went downhill in the 2nd set. Jerry seemed either ill or quite wasted, and at one point, actually sat down on a stool while he played. He also only sang 2 songs in the 2nd set. That was about my 15th show and I remember thinking afterwords, 'well they cant be great EVERY night'. To top it off, the Terps lost the ACC championship that same night.",

      "review_text": "A lot of great stuff This show has one of my favorite first sets of the '80s. Jerry is on fire right out of the gate. These are some of the smokin-est versions of Alabama, Passenger, and Deal that I've ever heard. And as many people have stated, the Bird Song is epic.\n\nI was at the show, and when they opened the 2nd set with Iko, we were all ecstatic, as the song had not become a regular part of the rotation at that point. The rest of the 2nd set was very solid but it didn't quite maintain the energy level of the first set.\n\nThis recording is so-so. I hope I can find a better one.",

That this is the only Jackaroe The Grateful Dead ever played with three instrumentals?\n\nI thought not. ;)\n\nOne might think Jerry got lost and spaced off, but he picks the lyrics right off where he impromptu-ily dropped them off. Quite impressive for a singer soon to begin the maddening decent into not remembering lyrics.....\n\nAs for this show, several things struck me at the time:\n\nNaturally, the Birdsong. The conga line circled the arena a second time as most everybody\u2019s first electric Birdsong wound on and on.....\nAnd down went my crutches as I joined in the end of the line, dancing along. (Recovering from torn ankle ligaments).\n\nThe other was, what kind of show was it?\nWell, we were high as a kite after the first set and a (very rare) Iko to open the second set.\nBut the crucial moment in the jam after L/S where the band didn\u2019t go into Uncle Johns seemed to rob this show of that crackling energy it had up until then, and even though we\u2019ll played, I can understand the band\u2019s feelings about this one since we sorta shared it at the time.\n\n",
