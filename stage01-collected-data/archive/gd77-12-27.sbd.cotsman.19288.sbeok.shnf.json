Yeah, and then I will find something in 69 or 72 -another crown jewel, of course- or 73 or 90 even...but still, this one year has so many killer shows in it. And the extremely delicious sound makes it all the better! Getting back to the show at hand...wow, the Truckin' rocks (like Broome County a few days before) and then the Wharf Rat! Holy Halucinations, Batman, but you really have to hear Jerry tear up. Phil good in the mix, drummers, keys, Bobby and Donna are all perfect. \n\nA great bookend to your Dick's Picks Volume Ten.\nA no doubter, a must have...and I haven't even heard the rest of it yet.

I must admit, this is my least favorite of the Winterland runs. I don't know if they were running out of steam, or rather that June, and especially March just had more of that extra special ingredient.\nBut then, it's been awhile since I've heard this Dec run. I'll have to pull out Dick's Picks #10 and New Year's and some nugs and re-evaluate soon.\nThe 29th and 30th are definitely the peak, Dick was right on with his choice there. It's hard to beat a Terrapin, plus the return of China>Rider after 3 years.\nHowever, this first night holds its own, and is one of those shows that's perfect for a short car trip, or a house party. I've always considered this Set One to be one of the most perfect first sets of the year. It just shines like a Christmas tree, both song-wise and with crafted, inspired playing.\nGreat songs like Bertha, BE Woman, Cassidy, FOTD, Candyman, Music, and maybe the best Peggy-O of all time. Even Donna is good tonight - I'm not kidding! And Passenger - wow, look out!\nSet Two is basically one long string of jams - Lightning>Supplication then Scarlet>Fire, Estimated>He's Gone. All really kick ass and are played with conviction. Truckin (still new after its return in Sept) is not the best, but Jerry brings it home with a fine Wharf Rat.\nIf you've got DP's #10, you need this show too. Don't wear out your Cornell or your Swing 77's - slide this one in the player now and then. You'll be smiling.\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

Check out the Cold Rain and Snow -- there's nothing cold about it, and is about as perfect as it gets. Supplication, Scarlet, also great. This is a better show than those of fall '77. The year went out on a high note.\n\n1977 was an amazingly consistent year, the quality of playing and singing was high, and there really aren't any BAD shows. But this is true of 1974, and '76 wasn't too shabby, either. The vocals of from '74-77 are the best. But 1977 doesn't have the flowing, experimental jams of other years, and certainly doesn't have as smooth transitions from one song to another as earlier years. 1977 doesn't have the amazing Pigpen raps of the late '60's early '70s. But Donna sounded great in 1977. So did Bob. \n\nIt's just silly to proclaim one year better than all others. The Dead wouldn't have lasted as long if they sounded the same year after year and played the same songs. \n\nThe best year? How about a 1967 New Potato Caboose, a 1969 Dark Star, a '74 Eyes, a '77 Estimated, and a '90's Bruce Hornsby Cassidy. Heck, the 2003 Joan Osborn Mr. Charlie is pretty nice, too.",

Jerrys vocals on final verse are pretty cool. \"Well I married me a wife She's been trouble all my life\"\nThe Scarlet transistion gets so psychedelic from 6:47 on Jerry gets out there and bends some notes every which way and that jam into Fire is so grooovey. I noticed that the Dec shows just prior to 12-31 27th, 28th are usually better than average.\nIn 84 the shows prior to and obviously Nov Berk shows. \n There playin hot shows on a end of the year News Years run usually at Oakland Aud or Henry keiser and didn't have extra presure and hype to deal with on Holiday. Prior to the cream rises to top.  \n I understand what you mean about Dec ending good as opposed to fall run particulary nov. like the from Oct the Hofeinz,Cobo Detriot,Field House,Cotterell,Rochester and Bingy I guess has a\nheavy sound to it. Kieth pressing his keys a little longer that lingers on. Kind of weird regular piano sound keyboarding but more pronounced and the band chugs along in thick malassas or maybe its too much herion? \n \n ps talk about weird key boarding Estimated is a trip. Kieth's synthesized & way out there. Jerry\nsolos in the jam at the end are so sick.\nHe's Gone>Trucin>Wharf Rat is played to perfection.\n\n  }}}}Real deal dead{{{{",

I think also the material may have gotten a bit stale and generic in 78 to really encourage great playin, it's hard to predict so from this concert, sounds as like there was a newly found passion for material building. after all the let it grows and cold rains, along with duprees and the china dolls where creating a rich blend of new and old, but setlists didnt really reflect such exploration in 78,   \n\nto bad it cant be march 1977 forever,",

But what it consistently lacks is dexterity.  There are lots of sour notes, miscues, some wrong tempos, and generally clunky playing.  This is not surprising considering they were coming off a seven week break.  It's not among their better performances of the year.  The fidelity, on the other hand, is superb.",

The boys played with such fire and enthusiasm the first three nights that they shot their wad and were subdued on the NYE.\n\nMy friend Larry, and I, attended all four shows and were right down front in the middle of the floor and the sound was the loudest I had ever heard the GD play. This show on the Tuesday was the only time this band ever made my ears ring, so for the Thursday show I brought my ear protection and was glad I did ~ the Thursday show was an absolute barnburner. Jerry was dancing, jumping, and windmilling. He seemed to be enjoying himself like I had never seen him before or since. The sound of his refurbished \"Wolf\" guitar was all-consuming.\n\nI am a little peeved at GDP for not giving us the full shows on Dicks Picks. C'est la vie!\n\nReally, this show is merely a warm-up for the Thursday & Friday shows. However, do not be lulled into passivity, this lights up like a jet engine.",

The absolute best performances are in the 2nd set, though: Supplication, Scarlet, Estimated, He's Gone, Truckin>Wharf Rat and RoundX2 are all simply transcendental.

This is my favorite show of October-november-december (12/29 is second, and more polished, but this is a different experience). This night, they are high as hell on a stimulant (wonder what, lol), really into it, and letting it hang out. My favorite Cassidy, cold rain and supplication ever, but everything has a great aggressive feel. The errors in this show don't effect the mood as much as they do in other shows from this stretch. It's not one of their top 20 or anything, but it's so fun.",
