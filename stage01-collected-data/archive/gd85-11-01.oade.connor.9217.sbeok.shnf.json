      "review_text": "The best of 85 This is the first show I traveled more than 4 hours to see.  I get down to the show and it was the biggest vending scene I had ever seen.  What a bummer it was to be a broke student.  Cold and rainy, there were twice as many people as there were tickets, and many people did break into the show.  Somebody threw a bottle of dishwashing detergent into the fountain and it quickly became a fountain (and a mountain) of suds.  The Man got the last laugh though.... he was undercover wearing tie-dyes and holding open cans of Budweiser.  200 people were allegedly arrested on this night... my buddy was one of them.\n\nThe show is obviously great from front to back and it's legacy as one of the greatest shows from the 80s isn't just hype.  I believe many in attendance thought that Drums would be coming after the He's Gone.  Then we got a Spoonful.  Cool, but here comes the drums. Nope.  Comes A Time instead and WOW! what a Comes A Time it was.  Yes, Jerry dropped a whole pallett of bricks during the ending, but his recovery was nothing short of remarkable.  Okay, here comes the drums.  Nope, Lost Sailor. I believe it's the best Lost Sailor the band ever did. The fact that the band did 3 songs after He's Gone was a real surprise to me.  \n\nWhen I heard 11/1/85 was going to be a Dick's Pick, I was so psyched!  My audience cassettes are GREAT sounding, but they were also 17 years old when the DP announcement was made.  I get the copy of Dicks Picks and wow, what a huge let down.  I never realized my audience cassettes would be a more enjoyable recording to listen to.\n\nNow along comes Archive.org, offering up these incredible copies.  I will take GREAT PRIDE in promptly removing the Dicks Picks copies from their CD case and replace them with these audience copies.  Sorry Dick, nice cover art and all, but this audience copy is better than the sterile, dry soundboard.  I won't throw out the DP copies, but I doubt I'll ever listen to them again after hearing this source.",

Hurrincane Gloria followed up the coast and it was kind of bleak weather and a bad crasher scene, as well as cop scene, But what a show.  The Dead were really on.  Looks like a typical first set but the music was phenominal.  The second set was amazing.  It seemed like they would never go into drums/space.  The recording is very good.

From Cold Rain to the late set Jack Straw the first set was reminiscent of the 70s - no crappy Esaus etc that were all too common in the 80s.  Spoonful' was wicked.  Everyone got real quiet during Comes A Time.  I remember standing on the floor riveted by how sweet and crisp the sound was.  Gloria is over the top.  Hard to believe it's been 20 years.  I remember being at this show like it was yesterday, and it still blows me away.  No collection is complete without this gem.",

      "review_text": "Hurricane in Richmond This tour stared off for me in Columbia SC. My buddy was talking in the hallway of the Holiday INN when on of the cigarettes from some guy set off the smoke alarms.. Everyone was ushered out into the street. it was show time anyhow at that point, as we were passing through the turnsyles for a Halloween show, the fire trucks were arriving, odd note to start this tour off with I thought.\nThe next night were were in Richmond for a pair of shows.. The weather was cold and rainy Hurricane Gloria was in town, I did not have a ticket, not an unusual thing in those days. I circled the coliseum and the parking lots a for a few hours with NO LUCK, I couldn't believe it, no ticket after all the years I've been in the briar patch of the Grateful Dead, and was I going to be shut out of a show, this has NEVER happend to me, and Never did happen!! As I was looking for  a ticket a real cute little brunete was also looking, so I started chatting her up, if nothing else maybe we could find a place to stay warm together hehehe.. Well, anotehr hour goes by and still no ticket and now it was show time, everyone was heading in, the parking lot was empting out, the lines to get in were almost gone and I was still outside!! Walking around the perimeter of the coliseum with this cute little girl gave me some hope of having someting fun to do if i didn't get in, then all of a sudden I heard all this commotion and and notcied a group of about 15 heads charging through this open door, so I ran towards the door without thinking, and ran across this gate that was down on the ground and boom I was in, I was officially a gate crasher.. I knew it was wrong, but this was a charge of necessity..oh well, never did it again..And I'm GLAD I did it That night!!I was in and just as I got in, the cops on horses had moved in and pinched off the rush. Once inside I was looking through the glass to the outside, and I saw my litte brunette waving in to me.. She didn't make it.. poor thing I thought, what a bummer, we waved to each other, smiled and I never saw her again.. So I pulled off my sweater and happily danced down to the floor. They were into Dancin' when I got in. I was rather settled just in time for C,R& S!!  Got high and hooked up with my friends...\n The 2nd set of this show will always stand out as one of my Favorites from this year and maybe in my top 5 favorite shows I attened.. 9-6-80 being #1...\nBy the time High Time started, the blotter was working rather nicely, to think just a few hours ealier I wasn't sure if I was seeing this show.... Comes a Time was hiting me like a brick wall, walking all morning, walking all night, and I taste the rain\", just where I was a little while ago.... Listen to Jerry's solo near the end of the song, the music seems to have this ability to twist around backwards, inside out and almost seem to stall, but then like magic, the whole band just falls back toegther and Jerry's Solo continues!!!\nLost Sailor drifting off into drums/space was weird, everyone waiting for those Romping opening notes of Saint... Then after the drums zoom right into Saint!!  Then She Belongs To Me, Jerry again just creating some magic, signing from his heart on thisone, and then the end of the set Gloria!!, Well if you haven't heard this Gloria you should, need too, must!!\nAfter this show it was another confirmation as to why I spent so much time and money going to see this band!! \nThis AUD recording is great, i love hearing the Aud energy during Gloria!! This is avail on DicksPicks but, the huge Aud sound works for me on this one!! \nI don't know who the OADES guys are, but man their recordings are GREAT!! A big huge THANK YOU to them for all their GREAT WORK!!! Thank you!!",

These were the days when you could still buy tickets the day they went on sale without camping out. We did camp out, but after we bought our tickest we realized we hadn't bought enough so we got right back in line and five minutes later bought two more. If I remember corrctly it was a general admission show. Cold, rainy weather for most of the weekend. I took acid for the first time at a Dead show and what a show! I was still new enough to seeing shows (my first was in 1981) that I didn't analyze it critically while it was going down - just enjoyed it for the moment. I remember going back to the hotel after the show and not being able to sleep and going out to my car at three in the morning to crank the studio version of Terrapin Station, which was very trippy, especially while on acid. I saw the two Merriweather shows in 85 and they were hot as well. I was always a Brent man. After he died things starting going downhill, especially after 1991.",

I was at this show, my first show, my first \"trip\", and it rocked like no other....When Jerry opened with \"Dancin' in the Streets\", the most wacky experience in my life happened...I was doing my little hippie dance, in my own \"trippy\" world and this beautiful hippie chick tapped me on the shoulder and I swear she said the following...\"will you love  me from behind?\"  Well, how could I pass on that?!?! I was an 18 year old virgin and let me tell you it was a night of \"first\" for me!  First trip, first show, and to boot, my first time! So I descretly lifted this fine lady's long flower hippie dress and just went for it!  Livin' for the moment, I tell you what! Talk about Dancin' in the Streets! Afterwords, she kindly said \"thank you, I needed that\" and went on her merry way.  I never saw her again that night. That song should have been re-named \"Dancin' in her Dress\"!  But here is where the story gets even crazier....about 2 weeks later, it felt like I was no longer \"Dancin' in the Steets\", but \"burning in my pants\".  Yep, you guessed it...a burning case of the clap....\nNow, whenever I hear Jerry playing \"Dancin' in the Streets\", that aweful burning sensation comes rushing right back to my mind!  I loved that show, by far the best I had ever been to, but I can not ever listen to that song anymore!  \nOne other fine moment was Bobby's \"Gloria\".  The best show I ever heard and a night to remember!  I sure hope I don't have a child I don't know about! Either way, if I had it to do over, I would not change a thing!  The Best Show!

      "review_text": "Still gets me I have had this show since friends returned from the fall tour 27 years ago. \n\nWhile I am partial to shows from 81 to 85, this is still the one that \"gets me\".\n\nThe first set is very good. You can hear Bob noodle on \"Spoonful\" before deciding on \"Rooster\". \"Stagger Lee\" is solid and \"Jack Straw\" is a nice surpise to close the set (I know \"Don't Ease\").\n\nBut the second set is incredible. \"Samson\" gets things off to romping start. \"High Time\" is a gem, a surprise, and this one is one of my all time favs. \"He's Gone\" really and truly seems like it will be the end of the pre-Drums song selection. It's easy to say now that you can \"sense\" the upcoming \"Spoonful\". But listening to the tapes for the first time (and I'm sure for those who attended) it raises gooseflesh on your neck. \"Comes a Time\" is Jerry pouring out his heart. And who could ever have guessed \"Lost Sailor\" was still in the boys.\n\"St. of Circumstance\" seems like the obvious choose out of space...but again, at the time - it could have been something different.\n\n\"She Belongs To Me\" is beautiful. And we can forgive Bob for pulling out his rock star finest performance of what has to be the boys best version of \"Gloria\". (I know they played it again - but I could not tell you when).\n\nAgain - if I had to pick 3 shows from '85 this would be one. The other 2? Hmmm....have to think about that one!\n\nEnjoy - God bless.",

      "review_text": "High Time in Richmond This was one of my first 10 Grateful Dead Shows, if I had to guess, probably number 6 or 7, and I was 15 years old.  It was also the best Grateful Dead show I every saw out of the additional 120 that came there-after. I also remember talking to a seasoned tour veteran at the show who had seen at least 150 shows before Richmond 1985 and it was his favorite too, so, could it be the best of 300 between him and me?  Yup!   The second show was no slouch either, but this first night was pure magic.  Comes a Time, Lost Sailor we're masterpieces and Bobby singing Gloria in praise of the approaching hurricane was like nothing I've ever seen. Inside the coliseum it was circus, dance party, fun house and rollercoaster all wrapped up in a rainbow tornado of something magical and fierce. You know when the Dead would REALLY open up and just lay it on the table, yes, it was the magic, all night. The downside was there we're over 185 arrests the first night, as I saw gangs of undercover police opening up car doors as they saw fit and pulling people out with no cause and searching them. Bittersweet memory, best personal show ever.",

I remember driving around in my car, in the early/ mid 90\u2019s listening to so many 85\u2019s- Chula Vista, San Bernardino, Frost. So many great ones- this is one too! Jerry\u2019s guitar is hot. The band is tight, fast and dirty. It\u2019s got that electric sound. ",

An orange spotlight centering her like the sun. She looked like a Native American in the Glow &  Made a salutation, that appeared to clear the mist from the chaos for the dawning of a new day. It was a holy experience & will be burned into my DEAD LORE forever... The acid kicked in hard & good. Jerry upbeat; with Brent following strong in the \"Gimme Some Lovin' \" which emoted the band's \"gratitude\" for the audience's high energy. Phil spills over for more by belting out \" LOUDER!!!\" . This show solidified my LOVE for the Band Beyond Description.",

However the real special treatment is captured in the second set where every song is top notch. A rollicking Samson  gets things started and melts into High Time. Honestly this is my Favorite version all time!  The same for She Belongs to Me> Gloria..... Enjoy",
