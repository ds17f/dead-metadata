The Caution (the highlight for me)features Pigpen's skills at vocal improv. I find this version contains more interesting vocal than crazy jamming, which you may be used to in a Caution. They slip into it rather uniquely, out of GDTRFB (only time they did this, most likely). Jerry's guitar a little low in the mix on the fanning at the end, but still a show to have.  The Fox is a great venue, by the way. Sound quality is quite good.",

I remember this very well due to all the unexpected (by me) songs.\nNRPS opened, and it would be great to hear a replay of their portion of the show, with Jerry on pedal steel.  Highlights of their set for me were Henry, Dirty Business and the Weight with some incredible Garcia pedal steel solos.\nThe Dead played two sets of about 2 hours each.  There are some songs missing from the first set which ended w a great China Cat / Rider.  I especially remember Tennessee Jed.  I'm sure it was played as I remember the crowd singing the chorus starting on the 2nd time around.  Cumberland Blues started the 2nd set which dragged a bit in the middle, but has some great songs too.\nI only saw them twice after this, and they never came close to this.  Great music in a great time and place.",

      "review_text": "Don't Miss This! All right, I used not to be a fan of 1971. I had mostly heard 23rd generation tapes of shows with lots of flaws. And then GD Live started putting up great SHN board shows, and my opinion changed!! Those looking for long intense psychedelic jams such as 1969 or the deep spaces of a 72-73 Dark Star will not find such in 1971. But hey, you gotta dance sometime! Although 1971 shows have some garage band moments, the point here is that the band achieved a new level of hard jamming on rockers like HT Handle, RR Blues, Good Lovin and NFA that they in some ways, never quite recreated. Listen to the April NYC shows, or the Capitol shows prior to this and you'll see what I mean. The great versions of Cumberland and China>Rider are highlights for me. And the Other One is one of the best I've heard for 1971. A satisfying mind jam, and for those who may think Pigpen can't play - listen to this! His organ is loud and creative in the mix. There is a small cut in the middle that sounds like a tape flip, probably less than a minute is lost. The following Wharf Rat is nice in that we get Pig's organ backing up Jerry. A bit of a rarity heard only in early 71 and Europe 72, until Brent comes along in the 80's.\n Then they really outdo themselves and deliver a blazing NFA>GDTRFB into Caution jam. And a fine UJ Band for dessert! A great show and for many, perhaps an undiscovered one? Add this to your 1971 collection!\nDr. Flashback ;-)\nPS - a note to hiss watchers. If you listen to many of these early shows in STREAMING audio, they will sound hissier than they really are. I'm listening to my SHN version right now, and for a 34 year-old analog tape, it sounds great!",

Other than that, this show (whenever it was) sounds like a typical early 70's show. Good old fashioned straight up rock n roll!!

Spent the evening in the orchestra pit leaning on the stage less than 10 feet away from the band\nand was totally blown away be them. The electricity that they had that night could never be matched (in my opinion) to any show I saw or heard after that. I was hooked on them to this day (I'm 53).

This show has a personal negative for me in that it was sooo good, I held this as the standard for every concert I saw after this date (Dead or other) and was disappointed time and time again.",

All but the 17th are on LAMA and I don't recall enough about the March shows to detail the 17th. I can attest that there was a show on the 17th however.\n\n I remember hearing Bertha for the first time at the March shows and Jerry playing pedal steel with the NRPS. \n\nThey had played the Fox in Feb 1970 right after the infamous New Orleans bust and reportedly fell in love with the theater--a beautiful, trippy Art Deco place built in the 1920s and good sound to boot. The played there again in 1972 and 1973--great shows all.",

      "review_text": "Take it away, Bobby! This is your typical high energy 1971 show (which is to say great) until Bobby kicks it into overdrive. Starting with a spectacular, nicely jammed Other One this performance morphs into something really special. The Wharf Rat that follows is among my favourites. Then Bobby really launches off with a run that culminates in an incredible NFA > GDTRFB. If that wasn't enough, a really special Caution follows. \nAn above average 71 show with great sound!",

      "review_text": "1st Grateful Dead concert I went to this show with some people I barely knew.  I had listened to the Dead on vinyl but had no idea what the concert would be like -  the Fox theater with its over-the-top velvet and gold decor, mescaline, NRPS and hours of Dead music.   I spent the night moving from place to place including up on stage.  Miraculously found the people I came with for the 100 mile ride home.  The thing I remember the most was a percussion solo that seemed to last for hours and Bobby's beautiful long hair.  I went back to the Fox every time the Dead played there but this concert will always stick with me as a magical night.",

      "review_text": "- In general, I can't love the sound of this. I've been listening to audience tapes pretty much nonstop for about a month, and they have a warmth soundboards usually don't without some serious remastering. In addition, the vocals are usually way high in the soundboard mix, and the Dead's instrument sounds are often much prettier than their vocal ones. Also, I think that '71 & '72 were the years of crisp cleanness over warmth & depth, & they didn't get their post-'70 sound right for me until '73.\n\nAll that being said, this is still a very good show, but fraught with tentative amateurishness. Jerry's playing an experimental guitar, and everything from the beginning of Truckin' to the beginning of Other One is played totally out of tune on his part. Most of the new songs, though, are played extremely well for being so undeveloped. The second part of the Other One is weird, spooky and sublime, the turn-on-a-dime transition between Greatest Story and Johnny B. Goode is breathtaking, there's a killer NFA (let down somewhat by a horribly cut GDTRFB), and a very unusually rapped and expertly played Caution. All in all not the sweetest show I've heard, but with grand highlights.",

      "review_text": "regarding njpg & beauzeau 1st the sound you hear are 'soundbord' then mixed to tape ie not the house PA mix. as such the taper needed to constantly wear headphones and monitor the mix to re-compensate for any stage level changes that then went to the board and were/ or not  'leveled'. so if 'Betty' was busy with other responsibilities she could miss that her vocal inputs are too loud etc plus  pigpen is consistently very low in the mix on the mixed to tape 2 track tapes. ON many tapes you can barely hear him on Truckin, loser, NFA, the few rare minglewoods etc.\n\nregarding the Fox theatre st Louis the DEAD were scheduled to play there in the summer of 86 but the shows were canceled due to Jerry's coma. Im a fan of old movie palaces/vaudeville theatres and was waiting for those shows having seen them at the Atlanta Fox",

      "review_text": "fairly sloppy I just listened to this for the first time today and I will agree with several other reviewers here in that this is a pretty sloppy show.  There is a huge section in the middle where someone is very out of tune and lots of missed lyrical cues throughout.  Jerry's lyric delivery and timing on \"Wharf Rat\" is all over the place.  All in all it really feels like the band is off kilter most of this show.  Things finally settle in from \"NFA\" to the end of the show, with \"Caution\" clearly the highlight.\n\nThat said it's still an enjoyable listen and the highlights are very good.  Just not sure if it's one I would seek out for another listen.",

      "review_text": "There's always room for dessert! <br />This show is mainly known for having the only Caution of '71. Overall it's not a standout for the early part of the year - just yr average '71 show [April gets better]. The playing isn't the tightest, but if '71 is your jam, you will like; others should start elsewhere in the year. They were back in the Lou after just 5mos, in what is one of the world's most ornate theaters.\n\nFirst Set. The set is solid enough, but short on crackling oomph, with several out of tune sections. No tour highlights, but <i>China Cat</i> is dynamic. The beginning of <i>Casey Jones</i> is cut on the SBD. <i>Bertha</i> is rather uptempo, though with several verse flubs. <i>Loser</i> is an early version, and still coming along. <i>Rider</i> has a cut @1:15 (the OFFicial release inserts 4/25/71 @1:15>2:20). On <i>Playing in the Band</i>, Bobby sings the 3rd verse twice and the band is a bit off, but it all comes together for the break on <i>Cumberland</i>.\n\nSecond Set. The beginning is cut on <i>Truckin'</i>. The OFF uses 4/14/71 for the 1st 57secs (mastered at the wrong speed). Jer just plays chords on the jam section, but I like this one. He tries starting TOO, but first the drummers want a piece. <i>The Other One</i> has a reel flip @7:50. The OFF has an edit @7:41, removing 36secs of the SBD. The next batch are average to below. <i>Greatest Story</i> was not yet fully fleshed so it's no surprise when they dump into <i>JBG</i>. Let's not forget the band experimented right on stage, with entailed risks. <i>Not Fade Away</i> is the most dynamic of the set. <i>Goin' Down the Road</i> has a cut @2:29. The OFF makes an edit @2:01, cutting all of the main solo, then roughly patching with 12secs from 4/12/71. It's too bad we're missing much of the set/show high point. This is the only <i>Caution</i> between 11/6/70>3/22/72 (though it doesn't stack against those years). The rest is GOGD.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 2\u00be stars\n\nHighlights:\nNot objectively\n\nSOURCES: The 130560_MrBill sounds the same as yerys_1663 but trims the tunings. Your choice. The SBDs have several slow speed wobbles, more noticeable in some places (e. g. in Wharf and China Cat). The OFF ameliorates some of the wobbles (others can still be heard, such as the solo in Loser) but introduces other pitch errors, <u>needing -1% pitch correction</u> on average. The beginning patch of <u>Truckin' needs +2%</u> and the channels are switched on all but Sugar Mag (plus some re-balancing and EQ really helps). On the SBD, Loser and I Know You Rider need <u>-1% pitch correction</u>. China Cat <u>needs -2%</u> at the beginning, then slows to <u>needing -1%</u>. After the cut it <u>needs +1% and then 0%</u>. On the second set, Wharf, Sugar Mag, NFA & UJB <u>need -1%</u>. Goin' Down the Road <u>needs -2% and then -1% after the cut</u>. Also, the channels are switched from Casey Jones>Cumberland, plus Sugar Mag. <b>30 Trips</b> has much of the show, except edited versions of Rider, Truckin', TOO, & GDtRFB. <b>Definitive Live Story</b> has Ain't It Crazy.\n\n<b><u>3/17/71</u></b>\u00a0\u00a0 Two songs from the night before were posted by Lemieux (which run fast, <u>needing -1%</u>). He has never given a setlist but did say the tape has cuts during Hard to Handle and The Other One suite. They may be just reel flips, or this show may have been cut up during production of <b>Skull Fuck</b>. We don't know more than those two titles and the two posted (Me & Bobby McGee/Next Time You See Me; 4 stars), both better than what we find on the 18th. Tantalizing! (C'mon Dave! But thanx!).",
