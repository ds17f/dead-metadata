      "review_text": "LEWSITON This was my 4th show, my 1st show was Oct 27, 1979 on cape cod, a great show to start a career with no doubt, however I really had no idea what to think of them live. I loved my Grateful Dead records and nothing I heard that night in Cape Cod sounded like my records, but it as loud and at moments so insne I knew I loved it. I went to a few other local shows after cape cod, Boston Garden 5/12/80 and Prov 9/4/80. At this point I had some live tapes and really getting connected to the music. At the Providence show someone was handing out poster for the Lewiston show, I took a poster and said Lets GO! My girlfriend and I took my Dodge van up to Lewiston, the 1st time she had ever been away from home overnight . When we crashed that night the lot that our van was in was empty and cars and buses were slowing filling it up. A neighbor had some fairly large speakers out on his deck and was cranking Grateful dead records into the night, I rememebr listening to Americna Beauty and SkullF#$@. We woke up the next morning and the lot was filled with cars and tents, smoke and dust.. We had breakfast, got high and walked around the lot, we scoped out the fairgrounds and the local scene. Then we began to make our way over to the show in the afternoon. We were early, there was maybe 1000 people sitting in front of the stage, we sat in the grass and Roy Buchanon came out and played a set of blues. Some older hippie dude was walking through the crowd selling blotter, we bought 4 and both ate one each. Then as the place was filling up we noticed that there was practically no security around the gates and no one was taking tickets, people were just walking in with coolers and whatever they wanted to carry in. Some guys even carried in thier keg!! We decided to go back to the van and grab some supplies of our own, of course on our way back we both began to feel the blotter trickle in.. The weather was perfect, cool, slightly cloudy, but crystal blue skies around the clouds, typical perfect New England fall day. When we returned with a blanket, a small bottle of vodka and my pipe we set up camp off to the side of the crowd. Levon Helm was already playing and we were dancing to music we had never heard before, and the blotter was really starting sizzle. Then it was time for the Grateful Dead, at this point I was very well versed with them. I had hooked up with a friend who could get live tapes and I was ON the bus. \nThey came out on stage, there was yellow scaffolding holding up the white tent over the stage, the blue sky over them, Jerry noodling around, then WHAM, LOUD ROCK AND ROLL, HEAD FULL OF NICE BLOTTER!! Off we went!!    \nThe 1st set Sugaree will always stand out as one of my favorites, we kept dancing and it felt like it went on forever, like 3 times the jam just got higher and higher and Stronger and Strong, and then Gently slip back into it's smooth leggy groove. They ended the set with a GREAT China>Rider!! I was totally happy at the point, the Blotter was working perfectly nice, and the band seemed to be playing precisley to our day. The crowd was completely peaceful and happy, we didn't see any problems, everyone was smiling, the 2nd set Shakedown street was another moment of endless jamming and we were just swooped up in the middle of this amazing, amazing music. We moved back after the drums and watched from far and away from the tighter groups dancing, and the NFA>Wheel>Playin>UJB reprise set was just unbelievable. We were lying on our blanket listening and looking up at the evening sky and knoe we were just in the most perfect place in the universe at the most perfect time!! \nI knew it was an amazing show while I was there, but i didn't realize it fully until 15 years later after Jerry had left and I had seen hundreds and hundreds more shows. Both Musically, set selection and atmosphere, clearly my number 1 Grateful Dead experience.\nThe Sugaree in the 1st set is worth listening, but once you have this show, you won't even stop listeing to Mexicali Blues!!! \nENJOY...",

All right, \n   because I offended so many nice people I have removed my remarks concerning Brent Mydlands vocals at this performance.\n   However because I don't like his vocals I usually don't review this periode of Dead.I save it for people that have more constructive things to say.But  I thought this was a good show all the way around except the afformentiond vocals.I even enjoyed Brent's B3 chops quite a bit.Remember it's a review, which means an opinion and we all know about opinions don't we?But like I said you won't find my reviews on any other shows from this era for that reason.\n Also, it was a joke not a personal bashing as some have taken it.I thought I was pretty clear that the statments were made with a smile not a grimace.And for gods sake who cares what I think about Brent Mydland's vocals.You guy's act like I wrote about your mother's sexual promiscuity or something.Lighten up a little bit.\n Last but not least, sorry to whoever I offended it was not my intention.However, I was only being honest and for that I can not appollogize.",

Sound quality gets a 3 rating.\n \n     The music gets a 5 rating though...  Listen to Jerry dancing on those strings during Sugaree!  During Rider, there are some crisp, blazing guitar lines that pull you right out of your seat.  That energy is carried over into the up-tempo set closer, Promised Land.  2nd set features a sweet Althea, as well as a solid Lost Sailor > Saint of Circumstance.  Worth the download!!!",

Levon Helm back on tour post-Band, smokin'. Phil and Mickey (and others?) on the side of the stage grooving to Levon, with the crowd going wild. Only time I ever saw the Dead watch a \"warm up\" band.   \n\nThen the boys came on, bouncing from the after effects of Levon, playing like they were challenged to a game of Can You Top This. \nLook at the set lists! The equivalent of 3 sets packed into two. A great song selection throughout, with a reprise of both Uncle Johns and Playin' out of The Wheel. Wow. \n \nLewiston 1980 became an instant legend, and for me one of the top 5 shows I ever saw, easily beating several New Years' shows. Yes, the crowd was pumped--more pumped than at any other show of the 125 or so I managed to get to over the years. \n\nSo forget about the quality of the recording, hoarse voices, crowd noise, and other whining. Sit back and enjoy the magic of the Grateful Dead.",

(The Sugaree is okay, but there are many better versions from the previous three years.) Jerry wails on Far From Me, a weak song that Jerry turns into somethign interesting. Don't miss the hot China->Rider, which includes a great transition jam in between, and some furious Jerry work in Rider. Going right into Promised Land works well, as it retains the momentum of energy of Rider. In many shows for year previous to this, Promised Land was a first-set opener; here it is converted to a first-set closer, and it's almost a different song.\n\nThe quick pace continues to the second set, where Jerry takes Saint of Circumstance to new levels of excitement. In Althea, every note of Jerry's solo sounds in the right place, and he delivers on the vocal as well. The second set revives the pre-1977 use of \"sandwiches,\" in this case, a club sandwich in which UJB and Playing are both reprised in reverse order.",

I am just blown away to have found this concert on audio. We took the \"magic bus\" from Kennebunkport that was somehow acquired by a classmate heavied up with various helpers including a large blond brick of good stuff. The music was incredible and much of what is in previous reviews brought back the best Dead memories I have from that or any other era, including the dude selling blotter. I remeber how the crowd seemed to roll in over the course of the early afternoon. Somehow we found that bus after and rode it back with about twenty additional riders and I met up with a lovely maiden from UNH to cap off a great day. I also specifically remember Tennessee Jed and Sugaree as highlights but this was a great outdoor show on a beautiful day and evening.",

We made it there (from Medford MA) by early afternoon and bought tickets at the gate.  We later also noticed people climbing over the fence without much of a problem. \n\nThere was a tall guy outside (he may have been wearing stilts now that I think of it) with an Uncle Sam hat on selling \"blue gel trips\" which turned out to be quite potent!  We picked out a good spot and settled in.  We were able to bring in many large bottles of liquor without a problem (we drank it all by the end of the night, definitely helped by the trips, but don't worry we had a designated driver!).  \n\nIt was kind of like a mini Woodstock as there was a little pond of to the side of the venue and naked people going for a dip.  There were also a couple of Hell's Angels near us and though they can be intimidating, they turned out to be the friendliest guys you could meet.\n\nThe show itself started out a bit slow with a couple of short songs.  The band may have sensed this since the 3rd song was a 15 minute version of Sugaree that got everyone on their feet and we never sat down again for the rest of the show!\n\nAnother cool moment was during the space jam, the weather satrted to cloud up a bit but the sun was poking through the clouds and formed \"spotlights\" on the stage.  Also I remember Phil's bass during the jam since it felt like the earth was shaking!\n\nAll in all an incredible show and experience!  We drove home in the middle of the night and got back to Medford as the sun came up.  We had basically been up all weekend but we still weren't tired (again the trips may have helped with this) and we were totally exhilarated!! \n\n\"listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock your soul\"!!!",

      "review_text": "The Moutaintop Talk about different strokes for different folks.....\nHere we have one of the truely epic second set jams of post-77 and folks are talking up Far From Me, Saint of Circumstance & Althea.\nPerhaps if you saw those tunes 20 or 30 times like I did in 1980-81, you'd be thinking of going to the bathroom, not how great they were, lol.\n\nThis was the ending of one of the best tours in modern Dead history (post 1974).\nThe Dead hit the East Coast in Philly on 8/29/80 & kicked butt, just building on one better show after another until the incredibly epic Rochester Aiko > Morning Dew > Sugar Mag show on 9/2/80.\nAfter an off night to collect themselves in Springfeild, it was back to buisness in Providence on the 4th & they finished the tour off in style with this 5 hour show (5:30 to 10:30) in Lewiston.\n\nFirst set highlights were:\nThe great Sugaree, which has a climax that reaches Morning Dew levels in the second instrumental. Also of note was FOTD as well as Stranger in an odd mid-set placement. It seem at the time to be heading into Eyes for a moment. That would've been something.\nThe set ending China > Rider > Promised Land is also of note with the fastest Promised Land ever played.\n\nThe second set was an epic affair, with a tremendous lead-in to Playin, a great Uncle John's that features a 'Dark Star '69 space Jam' right before the drums - you'll know what I mean when you hear it.\n\nPost drums is just killer, with the UJB Reprise reaching Morning Dew intensity again at the end & as somebody else mentioned, the ground was indeed shaking at this point from Phil's bass - GREATNESS!\nThe Sugar Mag to end is one of the finest ever played (but not as good as 9/2/80).\n\nAfter that, we got the double encore that used to happen after 'big shows' back then sometimes. (See 3/10/81 and 4/23/83 for other examples)",

The sort of 'blow the sky door off the hinges, wide open night' on which dedicated deadheads were born.\n\nBeautiful Late Summer Afternoon\n\nI recall someone near us with a ballon of Micky Mouse, which announced he had Micky Mouse blotter- this back in the day when one dose was 100 mcg, about double the current level ( but still at only 20% of the heroic, original 1960's era, 500 mcg \"Acid Test\" levels!\n\nNeedless to say, that neighbor was the source of my 2nd journey of that sort too.\n\nI recall the sound of the fog horn peeeerfectly leading the opening of Playing in the Band\nand oh, lost, in the purest of dead musicals, for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe Wheel was I suppose the highlight for me - the words seared into my mind.\n\nI though it was the show that had made me so- blissed out and full of energy; lo, however, on the drive home it dawned on me that the magic micky mouse blotter had without doubt played a significant role in the total experience! \nAnd well it should- that is after all, the simple recipe to thence be repeated in the years to come oh so many times, here and there, near and far, with that great traveling carnival of light and love. All you needed, was 1) A ticket to the show, 2) not every night, true, but more often than not, lets admit it-a dose, more if that was your thing but one, or sometimes - a half ( see however note above re strength then and now). 3) a friend or a few to travel there and back with, though not strictly speaking necessary either- friends, old, new and not yet met were there, in sometimes large numbers- seriously, like, over the years, it really adds up- such a warm shaggy friendly bunch of freaks were were/are, too!\n\nAnd, viola, al set. Have a mind bending -ly good night, and- well, sunrise too, before you sleep. \n \nOptional as well, but bless 'em when well provided, some warm clothes and food and drink for post show, though all manner of tasty and or wearables were to be found in a large open air informal market in the parking lot- quality stuff too, in wide variety, for reasonable, often negotiable and or barter ready price.\n\nOh show # 2 of- how many?

All of the boys played fresh and crisp, especially Jerry and Brent. If you were there, you'll never forget it. Only the second and may be the best show I saw out of over 100 seen, but beyond that it was also one of the greatest days of my young life at that time. Codified my status as a Deadhead and set me down the path that led to so many fun times, cool people and great musical experiences to come.",

      "review_text": "Really one of the best shows ever even though it was in 1980 This was my 2nd Dead show. Can you imagine?? My second one! The first was an awesome affair at Glens Falls in the spring of 80. Loved it! But this show was like being in rocket blasted into space at warp speed! The weather was incredible, the venue was incredible! As someone mentioned it reminded me a bit of Woodstock. The warmups were great but then the Dead came on and really went crazy for three hours. Every song was powerful - LOVED the Alabama and Shakedown set openers. Picture thinking of the studio versions of those songs and then seeing them live like that! It was an epiphany. Sugaree was insane....and they jammed monumentally throughout the whole show. And with the stories that came out of this weekend I could write a book! As I said - this was one of the best and even after it being only my second show I knew that night that it was a special evening. In years to come, Brokedown Palace, although a beautiful song, would be less than exciting for an encore. But, as with everything else with this show, it was perfection. Btw - re: Brent's vocals...whatever. That is Brent's sound and whereas I think most of us appreciated his fantastic keyboard playing more than his vocals you can't make an thing out of it. Now, I really hate to say this but who was better at the keys - Pigger, Keith, or Brent?",

It was a bring your own show and security let us enjoy the day that's all I can say.  I'll never forget it.  I saw the dead close to 100 times over the years and this was one of the best.

First off Roy Buchanan and then the Cate Brothers were great openers. Was a fan of Roy before then, but man he smoked that crowd.  Then the good old Grateful Dead came out, and just blew the place away. I was largely hanging out in front of the sound board, and ended up seeing lots of folks from my high school days (Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro NH - class of 1980).  Standouts for me: Alabama Getaway, Sugaree, Far From Me, China-Rider, and an awesome Shakedown Street, lots more amazing moments... Very special day front to back, a truly grate memory from my youth.  Miss those days, and miss Garcia always, never to be replaced for me.  BTW I've  gathered the town folks weren't happy with that day.  I still recall there were peoples houses a few hundred feet behind the stage, and I remember thinking at various points, and during Space, that Phil was going to bring those houses down.  When up in Maine about 10 years ago I drove through Lewiston to visit that hallowed ground and the fairgrounds are gone.  Also found the place on Google Earth...",

There was fire through Sugaree, (though Bob gets way too loud on the epic peak nearly drowning out Jerry), but then NOT HOT at all....Don't believe me? Listen closely to Shakedown for instance...it goes nowhere. Tenn Jed super slow and flat. Stranger; they went nowhere at all with Jerry repeating the exit melody of his solo over and over again waiting for Bob. Even the start of Me and My Uncle; the drummers had the beat reversed and and didn't correct it until the second verse. Althea , while cool in the second set was limp with uninspired breaks by Garcia....Then there was a very very untypically long break before going into Playing. I suspect the band took time to smoke pot as suddenly they started to gel and make better music. A huge set or unusual one often time meant the band was making up for playing poorly.",
