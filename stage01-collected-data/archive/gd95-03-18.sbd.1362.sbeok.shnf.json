(it was picked by Dick to be played at the memorial service for Jerry in Golden Gate Park)  To this day the visions still brings a tear to my eye after a few beers.

The strength of this show lies in the breakout of 'All too Much,'one of my faves from Yellow Submarine, then into Jerry's hush-hush version of Aiko where he brings it down to a whisper, then explodes.  Playin>Uncle contained some nice jamming, but the jam highlight, for me, was the one out of space; it was like Martian techno.  Visions was nice; I love the song, but it doesn't pack the emotional punch that a song in that slot usually does.  Fantastic show; one of the best of the year.\n\nEncore: Rain - I love that song!!!",

I do, however, think that this version of Visions is as good as the mid-80s version[s] - namely the Berkeley Community '86 (??maybe 4/23/86??).  Although the guitar work is not as good (IMHO, Jerry's guitar playing peaked in the early to mid '80s til 7/7/86 [e.g., JGB 80-82; Dead 84-85], the playing is inspired and the vocals are not too bad.  Its nice to see so many low gen sbds as well as high quality auds from this period - - so, I guess there are some good things about '95!!",

In retrospect it was a much stronger show then the next night(even w/ unbroken chain)although jerry was not at his best te rest of the band was getting better up into 95 and the nights jerry could get it going the band was there behind him",

My first Spectrum show was 4/08/1985, and if you go back to hear that show you can at least hear what the band could do, even though many would still say they were sloppy in that era.  Never the less, I was 16, and high, and I loved every minute of it.  So, if this was the only era you caught, then you are forgiven for liking this.  The Bucket was never a favourite opener for me, and by West L.A, I was almost ready to head for my car.  I could tell right away the chemistry of the night was going to stink.  Jerry was waring some funky red-sweat pants and looked like he just got out of bed.  He kept shaking his head because he was having problems with his gear and there were long delays between songs (even for the Dead). When Weir procured an acoustic for El Paso, I was becoming really bummed.  The playing was so flat and the mood can only be described as dark from what I remember, which I guess is appropriate since this is the last time I would see Jerry in the flesh.  Welnik never really became a solid member, and when they started to do Who songs, I knew they were toast.  It's All Too Much actually gives me anxiety when I listen to it.  These guys were not having fun at this point.  Iko may have been a great party tune in the 80's but, I don't know, at this point everything they were doing just reeked of a lack of inspiration.  The Visions is of genuine interest, but after the entire performance it was just too little too late (at least this is how I felt at the time).  The great hall mark of a good Dead show is that it rocks and inspires from start to finish, and this was just a mess.  I left during Rain and decided that I guess have just outgrown this stuff?  There is some very good news on the Dead front.  They are back!  I saw them last light on the 2009 tour and they are inspired again and seem to have a direction musically.  It is a testement to how great the band once was that even without Garcia they can still deliver a great concert, and they are hot right now.  The set lists are amazing and are being played from the heart.  So go out and here them, I hope it is not our last chance.",

For me it began to sound heart felt and original again on the otherones 98 summer tour and when phil and friends came to our area in 99 it was like a rebirth of dead music. Ten years later i truly feel i saw some of the best music i have ever seen on this tour. Even with 2 young kids,a wife and a very full time job i managed to squeeze four shows this week and a half and i am absolutly in awe of the music and the whole scene right now. Jerry had a tough last few years, as a recovering heroin addict myself i really dont know how he even managed to keep it up as long as he did...hearing visions that night still sends chills thorough me. So relating to my title...we all have opinions on the shows we have seen or even the ones we have not seen.I have heard people bashing this spring 09 tour also..which blows my mind but like Ken Kesey said\" there will always be more dumb people than smart people..we aint many\".",

Seriously, Tom Thumbs, Ramble on Rose, even the over played Promised Land all sound good.  And Iko was tight if not the rowdy tune of its late 70's through late 80's hey day [even the slower versions from '78 through '82 were more energenic than the ones I heard in '93 thru '95].  Couple minutes into Playin', and I wouldn't guessed '95.  For what it's worth, saw a lot of shows between 7/31/74 and the RFK shows in '95.  And this one you could dance to.

All I can say is boy am I happy that I stumbled across this one. The energy is fantastic - even Jerry sounds great! They really reached deep down and brought it on this night. The first set is damn near flawless. One of the best West LA's I've ever heard. Vince's barrelhouse style piano compliments Bobby very well on El Paso. Take your pick - Ramble On Rose sounds 20 years older, Phil delivers his best Tom Thumb lyrics, and Jack-A-Roe (with its Texas-style swing drum beat) and Promised Land deliver. The boys definitely brought it on this night. Regarding the 2nd set, It's All Too Much is really quite good, and Vince delivers. We all know that Vince has gotten a bad rap over the years - he could never replace what Brent brought to the band. But I feel like, at this point, he was really starting to find his groove. Heaven forbid he introduce new songs to the band's repertoire!!! Iko Iko sounds great, maybe not Radio City great, but a very lively performance nonetheless. Next up is PITB, which flows beautifully into the rest of the 2nd set. There's no need to even discuss Visions, because we all know that Jerry kills it. I will close with this - because of Jerry's health at this point, we often forget how great the rest of the band sounded at this point, the drummers in particular. If ever there were to be an official release of a 95 show, I would recommend either this night or the Charlotte show with Bruce on baby grand for the entire show (for obvious reasons).",
