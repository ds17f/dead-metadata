The place ROCKED from the moent of the first note.. all night ..which is why not much of the Dead's 2 sets and 1 hr long encore exist- Betty Canter and the whole SBD Crew where on the floor dancing !- and the Dead finsihed at 2:30 am before the Airplances 2nd set- so Bill Grahm locked the Doors.. called it a private party the Bands Played on until 7 am.... Nothing ever like it again- Mogo got it started and everyone got fierd up with each set ... Enjoy whats here !",

But everything else is right up in front ready to smack you in the face. Jerry is absoultly stellar on the Other One and Phils sound is HUGE. The organ comes through nicely as well. He was a Friend is beautiful and Rag is nice and loose with some great innerplay between Jer and Bobby. I'm not a big fan of early MAMU's but this one is pretty good with a strong psychedelic country sound.  \nYea, it would be nice if the rest of the set were here...it would be great to be able to hear that missing Dark Star. Judging what is here, it would have been hot. \nOh well, I'm still happy with whats here. Sound and performance are great. Check it out- you may find this a keeper!",

The popular 8/6/71 prehouseboat tapes have strong crowd contributions overpowering the vocals, This recording is different plays a bunch like 7/2/71, almost a mix of of aud and sound. Seems as if the acomplishments of 69 are marked strongly in march and april, and everything after until around november is a rich mix of everything, including workingmans dead material.

Because Bill Graham brought out Mongo Santa Maria  to open for the Dead and the Airplane- who all played way past 2 am- so Bill called it a Private Party and had the doors locked-(he never pulled the plug) this is before Santana- the Conga's and Horn Section Mongo had lit up the room- Betty Cantor and the SBD staff were all on the floor dancing which is why there is no real sbd tape of this show...  know ans was there- doubters ?? Check out the Poster section of Wolfgangs Vault- the poster verifies the Bill- the Airplane took the stage for late set at 3 am- the Dead finishing their 3rd encore at 2:30 ...aw some Morning Dew... No one had heard Mobo Music in SF- so the whole night each bad tried to out do the other - the energy was unbelievable ... Great Sho -Ok tape",

      "review_text": "psychedelia extraordinaire this recording, and others poignantly discussed in the \"greatest audience tapes\" category, has sparked my imagination. that's not often it happens - because for a long time i haven't been digesting the recordings in the manner they should be heard. \n\nthe spatial breath of this recording truly captures the majesty of the Dead...one reviewer put it well, that if you have ever wanted to know what it felt like to sit on their stage, look no further. Besides that, their playing is remarkable! for only a few months after Live/Dead, it's nuanced and optimized for a small, intimate setting. Yet explosive in every way ... Bill Graham introduces them as the Seven Samurai, and i have to think he was right in some way. The Grateful Dead were chasing something ethereal, incomplete ... with this recording it's clear how much the same goes for us the viewers. Although, we should be content (satisfied) with finishing here. For a while ... Nick\n\nedit; \nI have a bit more to say after a few days of listening. turns out, each song of this set is brilliantly played. Both 'He Was a Friend of Mine' and 'Doing that Rag' are great examples of the '69 play-it-out style. That means, take a song that has normal structure and instead of doing the normal four minute treatment, spread it out and Make it dance ... granted they can't go on forever (save that for Cryptical), the songs naturally end.\n\n'Cryptical Envelopment' is truly its own beast. the song begins as they normally do, enraptured by its introduction into drums. The latter being shorter than principle versions (can't think of any). I heard some shouting on the tape that suggests Billy and Mick were feeling themselves, plus the playing is demonstrative enough that they certainly are feeling quite liberated on this day. And, If you have to listen to any of the songs on this tape, power through this suite ... it's mechanical, yet demonstrates their technique perfectly. Bobby and Phil are playing back to back, which leaves Jerry on his own to filter his maddening tone over the bursting rhythm of the devils behind them. The organ is funny, too! It sounds like a voice, like all of their instruments are talking to one another, alive in a civic discourse. \n\nAnyway, I would highly recommend this show to anyone interested. The fact that it's an audience tape from 1969 is unbelievable. It rivals a lot of soundboards I've heard, and to tell you the truth, I rank this one up there with a lot of the shows I've heard because it does something a lot of them don't, which is create a new perspective while listening. Close your eyes and let the sonics take your mind into a free-form shape ... Nick (10/28/2022)",
