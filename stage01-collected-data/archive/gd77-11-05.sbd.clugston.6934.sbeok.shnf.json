SERIOUSLY!!!  Listen to Jack Straw, The Other One, and Sugar Mag, and tell me these arent THE BEST VERSIONS ever of these songs.  Jerry's guitar solos have a lyric quality, a beginning middle and an end, that will have you singing the solos over and  over, they are that compelling.   Having said that, I've been spoiled by years of very high quality shows on cassette,and was disappointed by the sound quality of this download, my 20 yr old cassette sounds better..a lot better.  If anyone knows a very high quality low generation source for this show, it would be worth it's weight in gold.",

      "review_text": "Half Step Hall of Fame This is an example of a recording where sound quality really doesn't matter.  Garcia's first run through the verse is a classic statement of the song's lilting melody.  The second run is also melodic; the notes form phrases the way words make sentences.  In the third, he takes his time half-stepping up and down, and then launches into some brillant repeated arpeggios, building tension, and steps up note by note to a great climax.  After the sung chorus, he takes off on long runs up the scale, and then takes it back down with two-note side-steps.  When he finishes, you hear Weir chopping away on his trademark triplets.  Garcia steps up the scale with about eight notes, and they lay it to rest.  This is unquestionably one of the most melodically compelling versions of Half Step ever performed.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, you might take a look at performances on  11-23-78 and 9-1-79.",

The Spring show at Cornell was legendary, but this fall run was spectacular.  Each show pulsed with energy.  I didn't think they could better their performance from 1976 at the Rochester War Memorial, but from the second the lights went down you could feel the energy.  The boys were begging the crowd all night to \"take a step back.\"   I remember Jerry saying \"it's hard to get off seeing all these smashed human bodies up here\" or something to that effect.   The crowd surged towards the stage all night, no matter what.   You could feel the whole building undulating with energy from the first note to the last.    I remember, after all of these shows in the fall, I couldn't keep myuself from heading to SF for the Winterland New Year's run.   We heard hints of China Cat this night, which finally got broken out on 12/29 at Winterland.",

      "review_text": "My 1st Show In my humble opinion, there will never be another period such as the Fall 1977 tour. The thing that amazes me is the extent to which the Dead rocked out their songbook so roughly during that period as opposed to other years when they were much more mellow and respectful of the music.  Perhaps Garcia was really digging his junk at the time, perhaps the band as a whole was just ready to kick out the jams.  I mean, check out The Other One and Sugar Mag - ridiculously hot.  Anyway - this was a great show. For some reason I passed up the opportunity to go to Binghamton the next night and what a mistake!!  Rochester 11/5/77 was great, but Bingo the next nite was truly historic, so check that one out.",

My opinion is that we should all be grateful (no pun intended) that there is so much free music avaiable.  Given the amount of stuff that I have been able to download, having to pay for the occasional show doesn't bother me.  The exception to this are the partial shows where certain songs don't get released.  Case in point: I would love to have the complete shows for all of Albany '90.",

DamnRebel  represents .0000000001% of the people who use this exceptional service, and speaks only for himself; which he has every right to do, and which I wholeheartedly support...God bless the First Amendment!  But I must add, his views in no way represent the majority.  I would hate to see anyone at Archive offended, or outraged by his message. It is my opinion that The Grateful Dead has every right to sell thier product; and one that the majority of us are willing to purchase, as a means to support our fellow musical heros.  Lastly, I think the members of the Grateful Dead would agree it isn't about the band or the audience, (it's almost safe to say one wouldn't exist without the other); but rather it is completely, and without hesitation about the Spirit of the music.  Long live Dick's Picks!  Peace out, Shed",

The art work, sound quality, and durability of the discs -- and now thankfully the jewel cases -- are second to none.\nSimply stated, even if I had downloaded three copies of a show already -- Say, 10/09/82 -- from Archive, I'd still buy the Dick's Picks release of this show.\nThe free music here is great.  More especially, I really enjoy the streams.  I will never stop appreciating the vast archive of my favorite band.  Buying the Dick's Picks and other stuff is a nice way to say \"thanks\" to everyone that put it together.\nWith that said, I can fully appreciate pulling the soundboards of these shows from the available downloadable shows.  I only wonder why the audience releases of these shows aren't still available...\nI think that the only thing DamnRebel was bringing up was the message that comes up when we click on a link for this show on Archive.  As a user, customized messages are nice.  As a developer, they can be a total pain... strictly speaking from a maintenance level.  Take the message for what it's worth, bro.\nKeep on rockin'",

      "review_text": "UPDATE/Listen to the AUD Recording UPDATE\n\nOn 9-9-04, I thought this would be a Dick's Picks release if the sound quality could be improved.  I opted to download the AUD, which is very good for what it is.  I just listened to DP 34 and the AUD - both are outstanding.  While I appreciate the bonus tracks on DP, I would recommend skipping those tracks so you can hear the entire 11-5 show as it was and then go back to the bonus tracks.  Get the AUD if possible.\n\nPS  I agree with the others that say you should buy the DP releases.  While it is disappointing that some are chopped up, the quality of the releases are as good as it gets.  I have all 34 and counting.\n\nThe sound quality is lacking and has material distortion rising from the bass range.  However, this show is extremely exciting. The versions of Mississippi Half-Step, New Minglewood Blues and the entire second set are among the best of 1977.  An audience recording is also listed on the Archive and is the one to download.  The show (playing and song list) gets 5 stars, while the sound quality of this recording gets 2 stars.  \n\nThe audience tape gets 4 stars because the sound quality is so much better.  The audience version brings out some of the interaction between the band and the crowd.  I was at this show (among others in 1977) and the intensity of the evening comes through.  Jerry (and the whole band) came ready to play this night.  I am quite happy to have the audience recording to relive the night.\n\nI would add the audience copy without hesitation.  If you get too hung up on having a sound board recording, you will miss a truly outstanding show.  If a Betty board was available, this show would be on Dick's Picks or would be discussed as being one of the best three shows of 1977.",

I am SO grateful, no pun intended, to have access to this archive, I can't even articulate it. I haven't purchased a DP in quite a while, but not as a result of this archive. Besides, the Dead aren't the ONLY band on this site. I wonder if this is the same guy from the Grateful Dead Movie, that was complaining about not being compensated? Thank you to the Archive and for all the hard work that goes into this project, and I'll check out the AUD copy.\nP.S. I guess I won't! They're gone too:(",

      "review_text": "BS Update 8/05 PLEASE READ THIS THREAD: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=29989\nI have refrained from getting into a war here, but please read the above thread and you will see that there are BIG things going on that MANY people are quite upset about (and rightly so, in my opinion).  Several reviewers have been upset with me, but apparently they failed to notice that I never suggested undermining the system by trading shows that were declared off-limits -- as others have suggested doing.  I merely stated what I thought was unfair.  My opinion, OK?  Save your indignation for the corporate suits who didn't make the music getting rich off of working people like you and me.\n\nBy the way, I DO apologize to archive.org's people.  It's pretty clear that this new policy is coming straight from the non-Phil portion of Dead, Inc.\n\nAnd no, I'm not the guy from the movie.\nBut he had a point!\n==================================\nI wonder where my review went, in which I lamented Archive's decision to post that silly and dishonest disclaimer that the show \"cannot be located\" and that they will have it back ASAP. Now, the BS gets thicker with the removal of my review.\n\nI say again: If we are expected to be honest and not trade shows once they have been officially released, we deserve in return that the Dead and Archive.org will be straight with us and not post dishonest statements such as this disclaimer.\n\nAs for my \"griping,\" bear in mind that I already have this show, and that I wasn't fooled by the disclaimer.  I was speaking on behalf of those who don't have it, and don't know enough not to be fooled.\n\nAnother point: Where are the 11/2/77 leftovers?  When a partial show is released, why is Archive removing the unreleased portion from the servers?\n\nLook, what Archive is doing here is a great service, but it wouldn't mean a damn if it weren't for us -- the people out there who love and listen to this music.  Without us, they couldn't sell any DPs anyway.",

      "review_text": "I was there I put out my thumb in Durham, NH and hitchhiked to Rochester for the show. It was the first irrational rationality of my adulthood. I arrived at about 6:30pm, having been dropped off by two DHs in a cloud. I had little knowledge of the GD, but felt compelled in the worst way possible. A van pulled up outside the door and a guy popped out, wanting $4 for his tix. I bought one. In my backpack I had stowed a bottle of Rose. At the door, the guards stopped me and ordered me to empty the pack. After about 5 seconds of starting to open it, they waved me in to a hall filled with other 70's northeast hipsters, all keen with anticpation and hooting and fine looking young women. I wandered across the open, general admission floor, trying to get close but politely. I settled in about 40 feet from the stage, breaking out the wine and making instant friends with two guys that had \"just bought a pound of thai stick\". It tasted just fine - the old pungent wrapped weed warping my head with each eager puff. The band started \"I was born in a desert...\" My motto rang from my college age loins out of my mouth...\"and my number one occupation is stealin' women from their men\". BOING! I'm in it, the swarm, the bliss, the sense of home where I'd never found it before. By the time The Other One collapsed upon my head, the Rose was gone and I had become fueled enough to drip with Black Peter's moaning \"come and seeeiieeaa\" again and again rising up into the crescendo of Sugar Mag. I stumbled out into the night and hitched straight back to Durham where I landed by noontime. It was one stangely familiar trip I'd take again and again after the Rochester fire was lit. Oh, and The show was...well...pretty good I'd say. And quite an introduction.",

      "review_text": "11/5/77 I have read reviews on the archive about 5/7, 5/8 and 5/9/77 being perhaps the finest 3 shows in a row the dead ever performed.Listening to these 3--it is hard to argue. But in my humble opinion 11/4, 11/5 and 11/6 come damn close. I was at 11/5 as well as 5/8, 9/3/77 and 9/28/76 as well as about 60 other dead shows and I can honestly say 11/5 was the best show I ever saw/heard. The energy in the building that night was incredible. At times the crowd was undulating--is that a word? :). 1/2 step-jack straw--deal--eyes-other 1--were all the best versions of those songs I ever heard. It was one of those magical shows that is hard to describe. Another thing I remember was that the venue was serving beer--genny cream ale if I remember :0). The show was awesome and to hear it to this day brings back memories. Get the show in any format--Dicks Picks--even the aud here is worth the download as the crown energy comes across unlike the board.",

      "review_text": "Take a step back, indeed... This was my first Dead show, \u201cTake a step back\u201d was basically the theme of this night.  I was a freshman at UofR.  Some friends of mine drove up from Pittsburgh for this and we were a band of around 10 or 12 including some of my local pals.  We walked to the War Memorial and got there around 4 PM.  Lots of purple berries going around. It was a very intense high energy crowd outside.  The venue had a long row of glass doors. The doors opened outward.  By the time the ticket takers took their positions at the turnstiles behind the glass doors, people were stacked up 30 deep or more.  Their presence caused everybody to Lean In, but they were delayed and the doors never did open in the way they were designed to.  By the time they got their shit together,\u2026 well they didn\u2019t, in fact, and it was the pressure of the human wall that dissolved the glass barrier between us and the turnstiles. It started with a few muffled pops, and within a few seconds we realized the doors were exploding inward. No way out. Me and my crew were only about 6 or 8 bodies away from the doors, we stupidly tried to link arms to avoid being separated or pushed forward, but that ended up like a scene out of \u201cGravity\u201d where there was no way to stop that train and it just rolled on.  I remember the ice cold fear, trying to focus on remaining upright, and steering myself around the door frames.  Luckily all the doors were busted be the time our group was forced through.  We all made it in unharmed, managed to reassemble on the main floor about 15 feet back just to the right of center stage.  And the night unfolded in its own way, and it was beautiful. But at halftime it was really trippy to see how many injured and damaged people were stumbling around, mostly oblivious, I remember still the image of one tripped out guy whose thigh was gashed and one leg of his blue jeans was purple from the blood he lost. Very happy to have found this excellent recording.  It was the best and the worst show I ever saw.",

      "review_text": "WAR! (but, you know, as a <i>memorial</i>) <br /> This is actually a lesser show of this half of the tour - such is the strength of the eight dates! (This is Pt. 2 of a tour that also had twelve dates in the Pac-northwest and southern tier). This comes the night after the Colgate show; while its going to be in the shadow of one of the year's best, the highlights are big and there's a golden first set. The second set is average '77. This was the Blue Cross arena before the renovation, when it held about 11,000. I'm glad I wasn't one of the people pushed through the glass only to be pressed against the stage in the surge. Jer's \"It's hard for us to get off, seeing smashed human bodies\" says it all.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Minglewood</i> is so hot that it sounds like a 2nd set opener. <i>Half-Step Miss</i>  soars the heights and THEN goes... and goes. Jer's cascading sheets make <i>Looks Like Rain</i> worth hearing one more time. The next are good, but <i>Big River</i>...man oh man oh man. Spitting angry gee tar. It's just astonishing the way they are ALL playing - especially Billy & Bobby against Jer. The rest is strong - Jer won't stop on <i>Jack Straw</i> until he forms a tornado rhythm figure. <i>Deal</i> is a good one - but the top of set is tighter.\n\nSecond Set. Phil does a brief little jam while waiting to start. There's lots of looking around in <i>Eyes</i>, and lots of simple vamping. There's still some feeling around for <i>Samson</i>, though it's still a '77, but <i>Musta Been Roses</i> is the most solid example of the set. Weirdly, Phil's banter from before Estimated on 11/2 (about paging \"Sandoz & Dilaudid\") is stuck on the beginning of <i>Estimated</i> for 11/5 on <b>DiP34</b>! It's not a very exciting version of <i>He's Gone</i>, but <i>Drums</i>  with Phil has a cool, jazz influence. <i>The Other One</i> is entertaining overall but <i>Black Peter</i> is average (though Bobby is great). The section from ~10:05>10:38 on the SBD is cut on <b>DiP34</b>, and it's the best part of the whole damn song! The rest is average though getting a bit ragged by encore.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0 A\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall =  3\u00be stars\n\nHighlights:\nWhole first set; especially notable versions of Minglewood and Big River.\n\nSOURCES: The SBD (clugston_6934) is fine if you EQ, but given the quality of the alternate_3293 AUD, a matrix would be even better. If the SBD sounds too dry to you (it starts to pitch a bit fast at the end), you'll prefer the AUD. The J Moore AUD (cribbs_16757) starts iffy then improves greatly for the second set, however it's pitched way too fast throughout. <b>Dick's #34</b> is mostly complete, having a partial Black Peter (and missing the tunings and a couple of the  take-a-step-backs).",

      "review_text": "Mind Wondrin missed the boat. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of what was my 15th show (but the one that \"set the hook\" for life)  I noticed the recent 'review' by Mind Wonderin and just had to respond. Clearly this person wasn't in that electric room this evening, but how one can listen to this show and call it \"lesser\" with just a C rated average 2nd set is mind wondering indeed.\n\n Yes the 1st set was incredible (I still measure all Half Step's against this one) but the 2nd set was anything but average.\n\nMind Wondrin says \"Phil did a brief little jam while waiting to start\" and there was \"still some feeling around for Samson\". Brief little jam? some feeling left?!? Do yourself a favor: crank it up and take another good listen. \n\nThis 2nd set opener is unique in GD history. Phil plays lead bass to intro the song and throughout Eyes including a sonically remarkable post vocals bass jam into a seamless seque into Samson which blows the doors down. Listen to the interplay of Phil and Jerry behind Bobby after the lines in the \"ripped that Beast\" verse. They were jumping towards each other hitting power chords behind Booy as he faced the crowd. Listen to the beauty of the guitars coming back to each verse of Eyes.    \n\nThe entire band was hitting on all cylinders this evening. The setlist looks ordinary, but the magic was anything but. I might also add that it took us 26 quarts of oil to make this trek from the Jersey shore due to a blown gasket. I had no reason to enjoy myself but the boys had other ideas.\n\nMW thinks they were a little ragged by the encore. Perhaps, but if so it was because of the intense energy level throughout. As evidenced by Bobby's repeating \"crazy crazy night\" several times during the Saturday Night encore.\n\nI know that all reviews are subjective and some like vanilla and some chocolate. But after 300+ shows, my mind wanders back to Rockchester '77 whenever I think of the one show I would chose to go back and see again.",

      "review_text": "2d Dead Show at Rochester War Memorial It was a crazy crowd and probably changed the way they take tickets at that venue. I don't remember much of the show (big surprise) except that it was a barn burner and the doors were crashed and I still have my full ticket from the show. The show the year previous, in late September in Rochester, was my first Dead show and also a great effort by the boys (and girl). Upstate NY often seemed to bring the best out of the band. Now, I will take a step back to 1977 and listen to this show for the first time since I was at it! ",
