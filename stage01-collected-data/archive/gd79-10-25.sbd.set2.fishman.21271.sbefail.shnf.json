      "review_text": "Great Shakedown and... This is a very interesting version of Shakedown. Crisp sound.  Brent has got a razzed-up funky organ sound going, and is so prominent in the mix he seems to replace Weir in the weave for much of it.  Near the 11:30 mark, Garcia lets go with a torrent of notes at extremely high speed.  A few minutes later, he plays the few notes that tells the band it's time to turn back, but they don't bite.  This becomes a brand new weave, with Weir prominent.  Great stuff.     \n\nPassenger, wow.  The overall sound feels a little muddier than on Shakedown.  Garcia gets four runs on the slide first time thru.  But it's his second run that is remarkable, nearly completely done at Terrapin Transit-style speed, as if he's running his licks through a particle accelerator.  If you don't think you are hearing something special, listen to the sound/tone of Garcia's tiny coda after the tune ends.  Clearly, a man who is digging his sound.\n\nAfter FOTDevil, Weir announces that Kreutzman has \"kicked thru the head of his bass drum, so we're gonna fix it.\"\n\nEstimated features a unique expression of ecstasy by Garcia at the top of his in-verse solo around the 5 minute mark.  Brent starts the jam with what is basically his own solo, nice to hear.  At 9:20 it feels like there might be a microscopic splice, but thereafter Garcia is once again in fairly complete overdrive (during the last minute, he's a literal bumblebee).  \n\nA nice new phrase from Brent introduces Eyes, and away they go.  Garcia is almost too fast here at the beginning....with the start of the first verse, you sense that they really are at a tempo that is unrealistic....But after a few minutes, Garcia slows some; the jam seems to gravitate toward a more middling tempo, with Weir laying out an interesting chord pattern on the left channel.  At 9:30 the last verse ends, the tempo seems just right, Phil appears, and special sounds (11:55) ensue.....",

He would have seen bats and roses flying around during the Est>Eyes transition, that's for sure. As your attorny, I <i>strongly</i> advise you to get this show. It melts in your brain, not in your mouth...and, like another reviewer before me, I'm not even close to being stoned. Inhale this though!\nThis is certainly a rival to Dick's Picks 5, one of my favorites. The <u>Shakedown Street</u>...everybody is ON for this one but check out Phil's bass line during the beginning beat...and a perfectly played set all the way through with no major slip-ups or pitfalls that sometime drop a great show into the realms of mediocrtiy. Not this show. A powerful <u>Passenger</u> pummels you into submission and Jerry ends the song with a growl sound from his gEtaR. Woah. Next, an incredible version of <u>Friend Of The Devil</u> will wrap you up in comfort. Listen for Brent's turn in the solo slot, a crowd pleaser. Billy bashes in his bass drum and they have a quick equipment repair before they get <i>real</i> serious. Now onto the main course: Est>Eyes>Jam>Drums>Space>Stella>Good Lovin' (cut before the end, unfreakin'fortunately)\nA feast for those hungry for some high energy deadness. Oh no. Oh yes. The rasta-fied <u>Estimated Prophet</u> works into a frenzy as Bobby is knock knock knockin' on the Golden Door, then onto the mind-meld jam into a chuncky and boppy <u>Eyes Of The World</u>. This combo always has the potential to be hot and the set list delivers as promised. The boys lead you into uncharted waters, you better have a life preserver handy as they space out into drums. Micky and Bill are masterful drummers, as we all know, but sometimes you want to FF>> the drum section, don'tcha? Well, leave this one in 'cause it flows so well into the second dosage of space, all very rewarding. This is not the mindless dribble you get in later years. This is the shit.\nNow you're ready for the tender and yet always beautifully odd <u>Stella Blue</u>...fans of this song will enjoy some of the best Garcia licks at the conclusion and then, BOOM!, like John Madden just came through your monitor, it's on to what sounds to be a well-done <u>Good Lovin'</u> but it gets cropped, dang it. \nDoctor Thompson, rest in peace.\n<b>UPDATE September 17, 2005:</b> \nShow: Five Stars\nThis Source: Four Stars\nOther Source (see below for link): Five Stars\nI forgot that I grabbed a different (and better) source for this show back in July.

The Compendium says that there's an AUD available, but no SBD and the reviewer in the book doesn't go into great detail, but I'm glad I listened to YOU GUYS rather than that joker, because this is a fantastic show!\nAll instruments are clear, graceful, and known in this mix; it almost sounds like an FM-SBD. Phil is upfront and kicking ass, and the whole band gives off amped, \"coked-up\" vibes (a good thing!) Apart from a drummer-stumble in \"Shakedown,\" which Brent helps recover fromusing that '79 clavinet/synth sound, this is now definitely in my top five for 1979. Tight, extended, both spacy and sober in equal measure.\nThanks to the archive for filling my iPod with more Grateful Goddamn Dead than I know what to do with.",

I wanted to track down exactly when Brent busted out that effect on Shakedown or Dancin' for the first time and any other time after. This was easy, because Brent's first show was 4-22 and I had heard the Cape tapes and the Shakedown in Oakland Dec.\nSo I checked out all the Shakedowns and Dancin's and found the birth of this funky stuff was 10-25 Shakedown. Talk about hot! How can you not love it. I was reading a review of that Scarlet >Fire the hidden track on DP'81 someone was saying they didnt like it. WOW to each his own and we all have diff. opinions but God some things are fact. That is some sick sick playin. I would of been blown away to see Brent play that funky shit live. He was Big Daddy Gansta.  \n if your like me and you like this stuff Brent was rockin' start here on Shakedown. He was also messing with some spacey sound effect's \ngoing into drums and space etc around this time period more of that in Nov.(computer-spacey sounds)\n \n thanks for giving this some sort of technical name clavinet/synth? I wondered what this was called since '88. At one point I was refering to it as \"old school Brent fall '79\", The Sevie Wonder shit\" or that porn sound you name it everything but \"Clavinet\". So is this an old synthesizer or some kind of sound effect processor that runs in or out of his Hammond B3. \n  \n BTW Drugs may be out but I still love me some killer kind bud.\n later",

I really love the sound of the Clavinet and Fender Rhodes (or is it Wurlitzer ?) electric piano that Brent uses !  \nThis is a nice, funky direction that the Dead took  after the turgidness of late 1971 to 1978 (sorry Keith and Donna fans).\n\nThis is a lovely, lovely recording with Shakedown Street, Eyes of the World and Friend of the Devil  \nall real gems.\nDespite only being the second set, this really is a must have !",

      "review_text": "GREATEST SHAKEDOWN & EYES EVER ! Strap yourselves in & hold on !\n\nI declare this the \"BEST Skakedown Street\" & \"Eyes\" ever.  In fact, this may be the \"BEST Dead Set\" ever.  The Shakedown will take control of your feet & drive you into a stompin & dancin mode (warning- do not drive while listening to).  I think it's got someting to do with Phil's dominant bass, especially in the climax.  The \"Eyes\" shows off once again Jerry's sweet voice & is full of emotion, and ends in a very trippy finale.\n\nIf you like the Psychedelic Dead, this is the one.  But this Set 2 may not be for the country lovers.\n\nI checked out the other version too.  Although it contains Set 1 which is not here, it also has this very annoying girl that won't stop talking who sat right by the taper.  It's quite noticable.",

      "review_text": "What's here is pretty good, but... I have to agree, this Shakedown is among the best ever and ditto Passenger. Brent is by now fully integrated into the band and has really given the band a much needed boost. As much as I love Keith his last year and a half with the Dead was one of gradual burnout. He really seemed to have lost his way and despite a few good shows here and there for whatever reason he was spent. So in walks Brent and the band are reborn. The only reason I gave this show a 4 star is because it's a partial show and both Good Lovin' and US Blues are cut, otherwise it's fantastic.",

It's a damned good one, yeah, in my mind it is the best. Shakedown just keeps on peaking! As far as Brent goes, he added so much life! Funky shit! I love rockin' out to fall 79!",

As a drumnmer it's hard to explain in words exactly what JG's really doing but dcain certainly does.  I'll add that Phil's dropping some serious bombs on Estimated and Shakedown.  I'm not sure I can go 5 on this show but a SOLID 4 stars.",

The 1st set is real solid, but unfortunately no SBD available.  The 2nd set is huge all the way through. The Passenger is probably the best ever. Great lightnin quick solos from Jer.  The Estimated>Eyes could be one of the best combinations of these songs in the Brent era.  Then the jam out of Eyes into drums is awesome. It is a jam you would have expected to hear back in 74, very experimental. Wish Brent would have kept more of those spacey synth sounds. The Dead seemed to have something for New Haven and this one measures up quite handsomely.",

Today is my first listen for this set, after hearing it live almost 34 years ago!! What a treat, two of my favorite GD songs are Eyes and Stella Blue, these two really shine, as does the whole set!! The first set rocked as well!! check out the LLRain - Deal.\n1979 was a stellar year for the amount of shows the band did in the Northeast, the cancelled fall shows from Nov. 78 were held in January at MSG and Nassau, love the 1/10 Nassau, my first & only Dark Star. Riding the trains from CT down to MSG was always a great trip, so many heads on the trains !! Saw the UMass show in May, Billerica the night before. Saw all 3 MSG shows Sept 4,5,& 6. MSG had to be the best venue in the East to see the Dead, so many great ones over the years!  Wound up the year with 6 shows from the Oct/ Nov tour, including all 3 at Nassau, which for me was always a great venue also (Go Islanders - 4 cups in a row!!) Thanks to the archive to have these come to life again & again!!  peace love  & donuts to y'all",
