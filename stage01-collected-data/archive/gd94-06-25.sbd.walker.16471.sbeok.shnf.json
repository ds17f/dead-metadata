The 100+ degree weather was stifling, but once the music started, I didn't even notice the sweat pouring down my face. I was only 10 feet from the stage and was grooving with my eyes closed for most of the night. It was like being on another world! I've been looking all over for this night! To this day, Mississippi is still one of my favorite songs because it will forever be connected with this smokin' night in Vegas.",

The first night was a cooker and this night was more of the same. \n\nWe were about 25 rows off the floor and it was still brutal. I got pretty ripped the night before, so it was water and smoke only this night.  I remember having to buy folks water, cause they were so high they couldnt do it themselves. I must have given out 20 bottles during the 2nd set. \n\nWe left during Sat. PM, hit the casinos and cooled off. We gave away our sunday tickets and spent the day casino bound. Our friends came back and said the show rocked. Oops.\n\n\nI give the band credit for even showing up, it was that hot..",

And the 15 mile an hour desert winds kicking up sand in the parking lot made it even more miserable.  When I got inside, I found some shade on the floor and hoped for a nice reward.\n\nFirst set starts and some idiot in the stands nails me in the head with a balloon filled with ice.  ouch!  And then the show just never really went anywhere.\n\nThis was my second to last Dead show.  I saw a bunch of great east coast shows in the 88-92 period, including the Nassau Col 3-29-90 Marsalis show.  Find one of those.\n\nSound quality of this one is good though.",

However, the sound of this particular recording is very good, and Jerry really sounds great throughout the whole show. If he did Loose Lucy, you pretty much know Jerry was having a good night and playing well. So I disagree with Fluffhead that this show was bad.\n\nIs it amazing? No, hence 3 stars. However for 94, I have heard the band do a worse job. In terms of the setlist, I would say 2 stars. \n\nI was there for this run, and as many have stated it was a steamer. 120'ish degrees and not a cloud in the sky.",

Nobody's worried about it cause we are there for all 3, unless your a just a fly-by-night fan. We'll get our fix of killer tunes by the end of the run. What's the big hurry.\n\nSecond the boys wanted and liked to play these new songs and get them into shape. Christ, they needed some variety. \n\nThe Shoe Fits is probably the best one I've heard. It's got a faster pace then the rest and the playing is great. Did you really listen to Easy Answers? Jerry's lead was full of energy and kickin'. Boy has this song come far from the '93 versions.\n\nDude I've been doing this Dead thing since '71. Of course it's not the 70's but damm, when you have been doing it as long as I have, the new stuff is fun to hear and fun to watch them get better at it. \n\nIf you feel that way then you shouldn't even like the older stuff they played in '94 cause it will never be as good. \n\nPlus Jerry was back on the Persia in '94 and he had a real bad case of carpal tunnel that really killed him on a lot of '94 nights. But when your in it for the long haul you understand his addiction ups and downs and his physical limitations and take it for what it is.\n\nCause even in '94 when they get it right and your there on that night, it's still as awesome as it ever was!\n\nLet it go.

It's people like you with no critical thinking that make all Deaheads look like drugged out dumbasses who simply worship Jerry without questioning. No one gives a fuck when you started seeing the band, most likely you're lying anyway, very few older heads still on the bus at the end, your opinion is no different than any else's.\n\nLots folks don't like these years, even the boys knew it was over by then. New songs sucked, teleprompters sucked, Jerry didn't care anymore, it's all been told since. \n\nI also think this show blows, no I wasn't there but I do know music, saw tons of shows and have about 400+ tapes and this show is SLOP CITY, no energy. One minute you are saying Jerry had carpal tunnel and making exscuses for his poor playing and the next you are saying what a good show it is, well you can't have it both ways- carpal tunnel doesn't come and go from night to night, or didn't you know that- probably not.",

We were just going to go in to see if we could find tickets and we did at face value as soon as we parked.  This was the middle of 3 very hot shows, literally.  So we went in to the show during the masterpiece, and I missed an awesome half step, oh well.  I remember being dosed the night before and the next night but this night took the day off.  I remember it seemed like night one was really psychaledic and weird at times.  But good all in all.  This night seemed like they got all the cheese out at once, thank god as the third night proved to be my favorite out of about 60 GD shows I went to.  Yeah they were working on a new album and new songs.  The problem wasn't Jerry, it was vince and Bobby, imo.  But luckily, Vince was turned down for this show.  Shoe fits is alright, any Phil tune is a good one.  I also remember being blown away at how good Drums was this night.  But Last time>stella seemed way played out at the time but I remember being very thankful that they were playing those songs and the new ones while I wasn't dosed.  It was saturday night and it was the sing along vegas dead crowd, very lame.  I'm sure that is why they chose the uncle johns as well.  Oh well, like I said if they hadn't played this one the way they did then they wouldn't have blown everyones mind the following night.  And who says we cant review 3 night runs?  I never read that in the rules.  And if you didn't or don't get what's up with Jerry, you never will.  Jah love.  Jerry's in heaven. show was about a 2 and the recording and drums were a 5. peace",

My friends and I were pissed we traveled so far to see such a lackluster show, both in song choice and performance.  No doubt the Vegas fun factor mitigated this disaster, even in 110 degree heat. However, this was the type of show that made me question all the time and effort spent seeing my favorite band.  All was (mostly) forgiven when they rebounded with a terrific show the next night.",

Like previous reviews I thought the new tunes were smoking and offered new perspective on the capabilities of the band.  Some of the shit Jer was throwing down and the whole effort made it, and every show I saw, a 5 star (well almost - maybe not that last night at Deer Creek in 95...).  \n\nJust to see them take the stage and pull off what they did at every show was more than enough for me.  I find it comical to read some of the posts about it \"not being worth the trip\" etc... It was nothing short of incredible what went down each night regardless of how the \"playing\" was interpreted!!!  \n\nI know being a \"student\" of what was perceived as \"on\" and \"not so hot\" is a part of the deal of such an amazing and longstanding run by some amazing musicians.  At times thou - to me - is laughable given that we were all folks who choose to pay to see such a special band.  \n\nTo be critical and compare to other shows might be fun and offer perspective for those who care to read it but in reality, to me, makes little sense to rehash the past and pass judgment on what might have seemed like a less than \"stellar\" performance.  All the shit they served up was stellar regardless of the little dramas that went on regarding locations, weather, fellow fans etc...  \n\nWe were fortunate to take in such an amazing thing that I think will take years to replicate; if at all ever again moving forward...  With all that said I respect the right of all to weigh in an offer commentary  because it still entertains me year after year as I refuse to let go of something that afforded me ( and continues to do so thanks to the effort of al those that taped and preserved and serve up all this) great joy and pleasure!!!",
