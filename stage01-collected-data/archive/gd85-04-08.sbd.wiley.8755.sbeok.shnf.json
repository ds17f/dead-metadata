Certainly there were flubs and parts of sets that some considered sub-par.\nBut if you listen to the shows from Springfield on (not discounting Hampton) I think you'll be impressed. Revived songs, well-chosen covers and intense playing of GD \"standards\" can be found a-plenty.\nNow, there have been quesions about this being an audience tape or Healy's input...I don't know the techincal answers to that.\nWe all wanted \"boards\" back then (as we still do in many cases). But this concert is a classic example of the audience and the band \"feeding\" off of each other. Yeah, Jerry was ragged in some respects...but his voice lent itself to \"Walkin' ...\" and \"Big Boss Man\".\n\"Bottom>Superstious\" - which warmly welcomed for both a change from \"C.C. Rider\" and \"Rooster\" - cooks!!\n\nI'm normally a second-set head...but this is a must have first set!!!\n\nThe second set suffers from the first 3 songs...whatever the opinion is on covering \"Revolution\" , it clearly was not meant as a springboard to other songs. Which would have been okay, but it was followed by \"Hell in  a Bucket\" and \"Touch\"...songs (in my opinion) that belong in the first set.\nFor me the \"Esimated>Eyes\" and \"GDTRFB\" were the gems of set two.\n\nEnjoy.",

Due to festival seating for this run, I was able to get front row between Jerry and Brent. I think that may be one reason I so fondly and vividly remember this show. I remember this as a very boisterous show, with band and fans alike rockin' out and having a great time. The tone of the show, the unique set list and the quality of this recording make this show well worth listening to again and again.\n\nI HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!\nP.S.

But I have a question for anyone who's listened to this closely. Going into GDTRFB there was a little \"battle\" between Bobby and Jerry. I think Jerry was playing the GDTFB lick (and obviously won) but Bobby was playing a three-chord riff from something else. 20 years later, I still can't figure out what it was, and it still drives me nuts when I hear it. Had it been that \"other\" tune, I think this would rank as a top-10 show of all time. (In my little universe anyway!)",

This show starts off with some nice moments but just degenerates into sloppiness and sludge.\n\nIt's just sad after hearing a show like this, to see all these rave reviews about how the band was \"ON\" and how Revolution was a \"masterpiece\". Wow, it honestly was a mess.\n\nWhile the show certainly has moments (mostly in set 1), it's just dragging itself the rest of the way, sloppy, and with Garcia gasping for air.\n\nAnyone uninitiated, reading these delusional reviews, then listening for him/herself will just have more fodder to claim that the GD are a joke and that the fans are clueless. Neither is true, though these reviews would lead you to think otherwise. \n\nThe band has put out a slew of wonderful shows and there are so many better ones than this (and better ones from this tour, too). This show may be worth hearing for some, but why do we keep claiming rave reviews for moments of total wreck? Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome perhaps?",

I saw 27 ahows in 1985 and the only two that s*cked were this one and, even worse - 4.6.  1985 was in general a vey consistent and well-played year.  This first set is good and has it's moments but the show really slides from the supplication jam-forward.  And it is not the vocals - it is the whole band, just feeble executuion on several levels.  4.7, Jerry sounded much better, and the band was very much on.  Stream 4.7 people - Shakedown, Dew, Smokestack and the sweet She Belongs to Me, Do it in the Road, Lesh vocals all over the place.  Now THAT was a classic show",

      "review_text": "The best night of this three show run. Garcia's voice shows signs of great improvement, especially after that brutal showing on 4-6.  This show starts off with a bang, a Midnight Hour>Walkin the Dog>Big Boss Man trifecta!  The band is full of energya nd are clearly having fun.  Also, the crowd is really into it and goes nuts for the song selection.  All three of these songs are played with gusto and the Boss Man features a nice jam.  Jerry in particular is on fire for this threesome.  Bobby keeps things going with a brief yet energetic Uncle that segues into Cumberland!  This duo is excellent and the transition is flawless.  The Cumberland features a nice jam with frenetic group improv.  The Bottom/Superstitious that follows is brief and uneventful, one of the only low points of the first set.  Jerry delivers a pretty Althea with minimal flubs and decent vocals.  This version is laid back but features some nice leads from Garcia.  Next is a great version of Tons of Steel(if there is such a thing).  Usually I despise this song but Brent doesn't ham it up too much and the whole band is on fire!  Lots of energy and great soloing.  This segues into an intense Supplication jam that again has the band firing on all cylinders.  It's rare to hear a jam like this in a first set but this isn't an ordinary night. The Might as Well that closes the set is a disappointment to an otherwise incredible start.\n\nThe second set features some nice playing but unfortunately the energy from the first set doesn't hold throughout.  A clunky Revolution starts things out and while it's not tightly played, they are at least experimenting with different songs this night and it sounds like  blast!  The Bucket that follows starts off rough but uickly picks up steam and has some intensity during the solos.  A mediocre Touch is pretty uneventful but is followed by an excellent Estimated.  Bobby is howling and Jerry's first solo is soaring.  Also, the outro jam is lengthy with a spacey feel to it.  This transitions into a rapid paced Eyes that seems a bit rushed into.  Jerry's voice is staring to weaken at this point as well so they fade into Drums.  The GDTR has a weird intro but Jerry does some nice picking before transitioning into a soulful Stella Blue.  Garcia's vocals are very rough, especially during the key segments but it's a passable version.  They blaze through Around and Around before ending the show with a decent Lovelight that closes the show on a high note.",

      "review_text": "Great First Set First sets - as time passed through their improvosational career - seemed shorter and (I have no idea if this accurate) more of a \"filler\" for the Boys.\n\nThis set is an exception. In fact, I would agree with some that have suggested that getting the first set for this show would be more benefitial to your collection than the second set from this night.\n\nDOn't get me wrong. The post-space is very good. Even a rousing lovelight caps things off quite well.\n\nBut the first set Midnight Hour>Walking the Dog>Big Boss Man is extremely rare and well executed. Jerry's voice is not - in my opinion great during these numbers. But he makes up for it with the gusto he puts behind his delivery.\n\nAlso, I believe Bottom>Superstitious was a great change for Bob in his blues repetoire. Check out the Hampton version 3/21/85 and the Nassau version 3/29/85 to see what I mean.\n\nFour stars. The pre-drums was just a bit too sloppy to warrant a 5 star rating or a Vault Pick, again in my opinion.",

      "review_text": "Yeah My first show.  I had just gotten into the Dead a year earlier.  Had copies of Europe 72 and Workinman's Dead.  Hard to believe I've been a Deadhead for almost 35 years now.  With so many Dead recordings available to us now, it is fun to analyze the different years, and tours within, from a bird's eye perspective.  We can hear everything crystal clear now.  It's awesome (to borrow an 80's term).  \n     1st off.  If analyzing this alongside earlier era's of Dead. you are lost.  Each year, and tour for that matter have a certain style.  That's what made the Dead so great.  This show is a very specific time capsule of a certain era of Dead.  I had to laugh at reviews stating Jer's voice was shot.  Really? No Sh^t?  How did you pick up on that?  \n     The scene:  this was still the era of a real parking lot scene.  This was when only hip college kids were onto the Dead and used to plan their spring breaks around a tour, and before I got shut out of the ticket office in 1987 after Touch of Grey. The floor of the Spectrum was nothing but pure heads dancing their asses off.  This particular spring east coast tour from reviewing the set lists was pretty high energy and hot from start to finish.\n     According to the first hand accounts after the show, these heads were extremely well pleased with this show.  The talk was hottest show of the tour.  Personally, at this point, I didn't even know all of the songs yet, and a friend had given me little paper tabs (2) to be exact for nutrition, before the show.  It was an initiation and one that I have now lived to be proud of.  I was almost ready to bolt after the intermission when a friend (same friend) chilled me out.  Jerry came out singing Revolution \"It's gonna be all right\" and I swear to this day he was singing right to me.  \n     About the music:  Jerry often spoke of energy in interviews.  This show certainly has that.  How well played is it?  Frankly it is a little sloppy.  From a critical perspective, the set list is REALLY COOL.  Walking the Dog was only played by the band 7 times, and before 84/85 not since 1970.  BBM also pretty ridiculously rare.     Ill leave the Beatles pick alone.  Highlights from a playing standpoint in set 1 are a smoking Cumberland, Althea, and the aforementioned Supplication.  Funny listening to  Might as well gives us some historical insights.  This was a Jerry tune about a tour in Canada in 1970 (watch the movie).  For me now, listening to Jerry crackle and wail this tune without a voice, he reminded me of a great old bandleader (which is what he was) belting out a closing set tune (knowing this show was a tour ending performance).  He is giving it everything he has.  Great stuff.\n     There were many comments about the show losing energy.  Don't all Dead shows lose a little energy in a way toward the end.  Or maybe it's not the show losing energy, but the musicians saying their peace, and quieting down as the night goes on before the rousing conclusion?  The EstimatedEyes is pretty hot.  I did not realize at the show that apparently Weir fell flat on his ass during Estimated (literally)  This had to have cracked the band up.  The Stella has a really blistering and haunting guitar solo.  The GDTRFB is absolutely perfect in this context (Jerry without a voice at the end of a tour).  \nEvery year of Dead has a unique flavor.  This is a high energy, well played show.  By many accounts among the best of the year.  Enjoy.  Thanks to Archive and producers.",
