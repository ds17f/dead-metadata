The scene was good though, it almost made up for the fact that my car was overheating seriously. What I couldn't shake was a melody in my head that I couldn't quite place.\n     I met Roscoe, who was delving into taping for the first time at this show and told him about the tune...but I couldn't get it right and he couldn't help. The first set started with a bang and pretty soon the tribal stomp overtook me. And then...It wasn't the greatest Peggy-O I'd seen or heard...but Jerry's lead line...that was The Tune!!!\n     To have that capped with such a sweet second set made my night.

Old-school \"festival\" seating rules were in effect, so we waited in line outside for a couple hours to guarantee a good spot.  \n\nFirst night, we were three \"rows\" back from Phil, but this night, we were smack dab in between Jerry & Brent, holding onto the railing.  I had always assumed that folks in front had some impact on the setlist and I am happy to report I was right!\n\nSome old friends and some new friends in the area had gotten into their heads that really wanted a Hey Pocky Way, so we began calling out to Brent from the beginning of the show.  A couple of particularly enthusiastic brothers from upstate NY were supplying everyone with some superior greens (including the security guards behind the rail).  Well, Brent didn't pay any of us much mind during set one.  But set two...\n\nMy new NY friends held up a nice sized nug and we all informed Brent that he could have it if he played our song at the opening of set two.  He spotted the nug and started laughing, then he got Jerry's attention and pointed to us.  Jerry pushed up his glasses, glared down at us and smiled back to Brent while shrugging his shoulders, like he was saying \"why not?\" Brent smiled back at him and then motioned for us to put the herb away.  A few seconds later... WHAM!! We were treated to a rockin' version of our song!! Needless to say, this event kept us all very stoked throughout the second set.  I specifically remember that my friends and I were going berserk during the end-jam of Terrapin because Mickey was pointing at us with his drumsticks.  The higher we jumped, the harder he pounded the cymbals.\n\nEvery show I saw after this, I enjoyed watching the folks in the front interacting with band and remembering how it felt when I was there myself.\n\nI have had nice-sounding higher gen copy of this source on cassette since 89 and I am pleased to report that this DL sounds great! Thanks to all involved!",

      "review_text": "gso dead moved to greensboro from va. in '86. lived about 1 mile from coliseum and was very happy to have the dead down the street and to see the shows with my friends/townfolk. was struck by the \"stripped down\" sound. in stark contrast to fall '89 midi influence. we were close to stage in front of jerry and it was packed. during set break we saw a group of people hitting a bong that was at least 3 feet tall. \"how the hell did they get that in here, and why go to the trouble\" you see the weirdest things at the highest of times. the sound system was a bit buggy during this show but stellar versions of pocky way (on so many roads cd) and DEW. jerry busting at the seems on this tune makes it my favorite version. very pretty brokedown, also. the only bummer was some of my buddies getting burned w/counterfit tix. apparently many got screwed this night. the prick in question will be saddled with fake pass to the afterlife. denied jackass, hope that handful of dollars was worth it. anyway, great feel to this show(previous night too) notice bobby laughing while saying louisville instead of greensboro in first part of minglewood? touch of wang dang tease just before terrapin. thanks for the sight. feel good about the service you are providing. fantastic. check out gsboro '80(may 1) transition from estimated into uncle johns is as unexpected as anything you will ever hear. johnny b. goode that night is one of the best.",

      "review_text": "THAT WAS US!!!! Hey Joe Shlobotnick!!  That was me and my buddy Scott (we're from Rochester NY; he had the beard and I was the skinny one) who were up front and trying to get Brent to do Hey Pocky Way the whole first set!  We were, and remain, huge Brent fans (I even got to meet him backstage at Cal Expo later this same year).  He was the man, and I still miss him to this day.  I'm thinking you must have either been the guy to our right or the guy right behind us (I remember a bunch of us making friends and having a great night).  My memory differs from yours slightly.  For instance I don't remember holding up the nug for Brent (but I don't doubt it either!).  But I do remember during the first set we got a great \"We Want Brent\" chant going - the only time I remember hearing one.  And Jerry joined with us in \"bugging\" Brent.  Jer was laughing and kept giving Brent those looks, like \"they're not going to shut up until you sing\"! :-)  You could tell Jerry was loving it though; at one point he even was egging us on to keep on trying to get Brent to sing.  This show has always been one of my favorite memories because of our interactions with Jerry and Brent that night - and the fact that they took it to heart and played one of the best Hey Pocky Ways of all time.  I was only up front for three shows (12/31/88; 3/31/89; and 10/8/89), and they were all very special shows, but when it comes to interacting with the band, this show tops anything else I ever experienced.  \n\nJoe, please email me at skr213@hotmail.com if you visit this page again.\n\n~stephen",

      "review_text": "Ran Into A Rainstorm This is a strong show with a very intense 'other' ingredient which elevates the whole. I think it was the crowd. It was a great time around Greesboro in general, with a real southern feeling that I suspect is less now. Mucho bare wire crackling going on around. It was like a drug bazar outside. When GD was cranking along during the show that crowd went crazy-fun. \nI always loved HPW! I clearly remember this one.  Jerry turned to Brent and they just played off one another. Post Terrapin & MD are the other biggies, but it's solid throughout.",

But the standout song from this show is clearly Morning dew!! jerry is screaming, the solos are sharp and the entire band is killing it by the end. ",
