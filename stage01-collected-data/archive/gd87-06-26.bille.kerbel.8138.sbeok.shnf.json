      "review_text": "WOW One of the best Alpine shows hands down. 2nd set China-Rider-Estimated-Eyes-Brent Monster Birds-Drums is phenomenal! You really have to have the audience of this show to truly appreciate the intensity. The only unfortunate glitch was when Jerry totally shut down Brent after the Gimme Some. Instead of launching what would have been a Gloria that woulda tore the roof off Jerry slammed the door into a Wheel. Not a complaint but you can actually hear the door slam :) IMO one of the most underrated shows of '87!",

The Chicago area didn't exactly have the same frequency of shows as the SF Bay Area did and I was really stoked to finally get to see another show. The boys didn't disapoint either, this show really smoked. We couldn't believe it when they played Watchtower. This was only the second time ever played and was a total surprise. Also, as mentioned in the prvious review, the China/Rider>Estimated>Eyes is aboslutely awesome.  The unusual ending of Eyes is worth the download alone although I remember it being a bit much for my mind at the time. You know what I mean ;) I usually don't give 5 stars to AUD recordings but can't help it here.",

Check the board here you are the only 3, while 7 gave this a 5. Moreover almost as many mentioned China>Rider by name as saying this was one of the best of the 80's. I suggest you grow up, check the number of shows I have listened to here as well as the others and stop playing with yourself. Merri was not a trainwreck but I am sure the bitch that bore you is.\nINITIAL REVIEW:\nMan when they were on, they were on. This is a great show with a tremendous punch. The china cat>rider is a doozy and it sounds like someone is on sax though db does not list anyone.\n\nI will say the 6/20/83 Merriweather was a memorable china cat and worth a listen though Jerry takes it an octave higher here than I remember hearing before.\n\nA little anecdote about this song - whenever I hear a hot version I think of a time I was stuck in some all day drizzle on the Allagash River canoeing by myself in Northern Maine and as I paddled along I sang that at the top of my lungs and was filled with complete peace trucking downstream 30 miles from the nearest town on a gray miserable day with the just the otters and bald eagles among the evergreens - This is why I stick around here.... \n\nThanks LMA I had never heard this before.",

A triumphant return to our nation's heartland, a Full vigorous, virile presentation that 'we can still shake the tailfeathers off your touche' Someone musically gifted, (not me) should write a David Gans-ish tune about seeing the Dead at Alpine. \n\n1st Set: The energy si crackling both ways with a perky \"Stranger.\" This version is very well-drawn out...very similiar to the '89 Alpine version made famous by the VHS/DVD release. There is a 20 second pause before they fully commit to \"Franklin's.\" It's reaassuring; the drummers are actually in synch and thereby allowing the audience to clap along, if they so wished. Strong version, better than the one @ the Greek a week ago. \"Walkin\" is a tad more lost than the Greek's version, but it's still not bad. \"Row\" is effortlessly played. \"Tons\" is appropriately called. \"Push\" is standard, but because the energy is smiley, it's not immediately discarded. The boys continue to thrill me as their growth is evident on this successfully attempted 7 minute plus \"Cassidy.\" Concluding the set with \"Deal\" is the obvious choice; it's not fantabulous, but certainly is pleasant.\n\n2nd Set: Alright, who's the wild sax man? Anyways, \"China\" is short but intense and rages well into \"Rider\" Anyone who asserts this is the finest 'China/Rider' ever is absolutely loony since the one in '89, again on DVD/VHS, is far more thrilling. That isn't to say that this 'Rider' isn't '87 thrilling as everyone in the Amphitheatre was singing along, with the band every step of the way. \"Estimated\" is triumphant, not whacked out crazy, but a firm validation as to why we listen to show after show, even through less-heralded years like '87. \"Eyes\" lacks an attractive intro but as 'EStimated' Brent adds a warm synth which underlines the humanity of Jerry's singing. \"Drums/Space\" are typical. \"Gimme\" sounds large and vital tonight, kinda like that famed June in '89... AS Brent does an exciting 'Gloria' tease as the lengthy version winds down, Jerry fluidly winds the song into \"The Wheel\" everyone's clapping and smiling. With the approach of \"Watchtower. it's evident this band is ready for stadiums. \"Black\" is fine, but really just a warm-up to the explosive final one-two punch of \"Around\" and \"Sugar.\"  Wow! one should become exhausted after dancing to all of this wonderful rock and roll. \nWe encore with a hit-worthy \"Touch.\"  This crowd does Not want this to be a one-encore show, and perhpas to calm them down a ballad should be played to soothe their hearts til tomorrow.\n\n3 & 3/4s show.",

If you've been to Alpine, you know what I'm talking about. Some people call it a ski slope. And sadly, it took Stevie Ray's life a few years later. Let me tell you, it was a heck of a walk (almost as long as comin' down off of Squaw Valley after Jerry Band in 1989), but the view of Dead City was well worth it). Were goony birds involved? Sure. But the second set here served as the launching pad. Smokin' all around. Even a False Brent Gloria (nothing like that Jerry WTF? look!) between the Gimme and Wheel and the first Watchtower for many in the crowd. Leave the squabbling about which china rider is better for the the kids because it doesn't really matter. The boys were on fire this night and every one emptied into the parking lot this night with big ole grin on their face. And that was what it was all about, wasn't it?",

Alpine Valley was, at that point, perhaps the finest gathering of fans of the whole year. East Coast, West Coast, and In between. The only place where the whole family was together. \n\nIt continuied to be that way till the end. But 1997 was the calm before the storm. The last Intimate experience with 20,000 people. The golf course was where they wanted you to put your tents. It was really peacful becuse everyone was so spread out and comfortable. It was an amazing mass of fans from the very roots of the Deads huge sucess that was on the horizon. I am honored to have had this amazing introduction to what would become an incredibly important part of my life...my soul...for the next 9 years and quite frankly almost 20 years latter it's still one of my most cherished and respected things in my life.  I love a ton of music but this stuff is always there like a rock. \n\nNow why this show was really important.\n\nMy first Acid experience. Holly fuck...you know that is just a huge step. I took it at set break and it came on fairly quickly. I had done shrooms so I wasn't completely green. The music was so intense but I easily lost focus and was checking out the scene around me. Observing the world in a whole new light. Wow! Sometimes it's too intense. A little scary. Acid is intense shit. I would never see the world quite the same again. Awesome! In my 70 shows I did acid or mushrooms 4 or 5 times. They were all interesting to say the least.  I prefered to be in my own state of mind and really get high on the music. It was the best high. I was addictid. I spent all my college money on shows and gas. Wow, I had it good. We had it good!\n\nWhen we left the show we ventured out on our long journey to our car it was pretty far but it seemed like we had trekked the Saharah to get there. We took a short cut. The three of us all came to a stop in front of what looked like a massive crater. We all dropped to our knees and in a dumbfounded way reached into this enourmous gap in the ground.....Wholly shit bro's.....It's a sand trap...a bunker! None of us highly educated young men even considered it. That was the most insane part of the night but you should have seen us try to errect an old 70's tent latter that night. It was rediculiculous. What a great memory. \n\nAll that said it's a steller show. This is the begining of the deads great late 90's era.",

      "review_text": "2nd Show!. I remember this gig quite well!  \nI had, just the previous night, with a (then) close friend plus a somewhat distant cousin & his wife who drove us, attended a Dead Show in Minneapolis (where I grew up, before moving to CA in '96), at the now-gone Met Center (which is now where the temple to consumerism in US is: Mall of America). Anyway, my \"friend\" and I, went to the Mpls. show, I was 16 then & it was my 1st Dead show. Then, after the show, we were supposed to meet my cousin & his wife, who had this old, but bitchin' orange van -we finally found 'em & then proceeded from there, to an all-night road trip from Mpls. to East Troy, WI (with a stop at another mutual relative of mine-a son of a cousin of my dad's, at whose place we stopped in at & smoked a joint, had a beer, etc). Also, the thing, was, the 'friend' of mine & I had each taken a good amount of acid & so were trippin' our brains out, so, basically, the whole road trip, all night, we were wide awake, cuz of the acid. Then, in the early AM we pulled into E. Troy, WI, a cute, picture-postcard small town w/this town square, where the lone diner, barber shop and whatever else a typical town would have -and also, just on the outskirts of E Troy, on \"Main Line Rd\" there was 1 Supermarket, at which everyone (all the invading Deadheads) would frequent to stock up on beer, liquor, food, etc.-But, basically, this was a very tiny, no-doubt tight-knit community (thank god it wasn't in the South!!) & I imagine that, since the Dead up until certain townspeople had had enough of the wild partying freaks from all over the US coming to their town each year and the Dead got banned from Alpine Valley: which was such a great spot: once U got into the parking area, on the AV property, you,basically, entered this enclosed city, almost: no cops, no \"authority\", etc, which enabled various entrepreneurs to walk around w/coolers full of import beers, selling them 4 a buck or 2 each, others, roaming around, saying \"doses...sheets\", but, for some reason, at least the times we were there, there was always a dearth of pot available for sale. Anyway, besides that, you could park your car, then whether it was a big van, a sedan, a camper or whatnot, you could be sitting around, drinking as much as you wanted, smoking whatever you wanted-all w/out any fear of intrusion/busts,etc by any cops! It was pure paradise! And the thing about the tiny town of East Troy, WI, was, that, each summer, when the Dead came for a string of 3-4 shows, the size of the town, when you count the Deadheads, probably rose 500%-and think about how much income that generated for places like that cute, little diner where we ate a delicious breakfast the morning we arrived, the money that was spent at that supermarket, on beer, chips, no doubt steaks, chicken & other things concertgoers got for BBQ-ing, etc - so, one thing they could always count on, which would, probably generate, at least, if not more, a year or 2's worth of budget for a little hamlet like that!  Anyway, I had great fun-I was only able to stay that year for 1 show, cuz my cousin had to get back to Mpls to go back to work, but as for 88-I really don't remember, but I know that, in 89, a few friends & I all drove there and got tix for all 3 or 4 of the shows for those Alpine shows. One the next time I got up to Alpine was in 1991, to see a great show of The Jerry Garcia Band, which, was Jerry, Rob Wasserstein, Bob Weir, Merl Saunders and a few other friends. It was, unfortunately, in a lot of ways, but as for room -it was great- much more sparsely attended, but the show was great! Anyway, I really miss those Alpine Valley days. That was in late teens- best days of my life!!!",

Even though I saw other shows that were definitely more technically brilliant, more jammed out, or full of specialness (7-17-89, 7-12-90, 7-18-90, 3-21-91, 6-14-91, 6-17-91 come to mind), this show (my 5th) will always stand out as THE ONE that forever sealed my seat on the bus. The atmosphere at Alpine Valley was magical, and the energy at this show as never surpassed. So many memories of this evening are burned into my synapses. Right off the bat, the Stranger>Franklins was just sizzling. The Row Jimmy kicked the chemicals in, and the Cassidy>Deal was scorching to end the set. I heard there were 50,000 people there this first night, and I know I was incapable of moving during the set break, so I just sat there and took in all the sights and sounds. The entire 2nd set kicked my ass. Every song previous to the Black Peter were my first times hearing them live. The China Cat>Rider was not super long or jammed out, but so full of energy, peaking perfectly with Jerry singing the \"headlights on a north bound train\" that I thought I would burst only to have Bobby freak me out with that other-worldly Estimated, and then...finally, my favorite song, Eyes! Like the China>Rider, not the longest or most sublime, but stunningly fresh and fast-paced. The jungle animals just about launched me into a place from which I thought I wouldn't return. The Gloria tease into Gimme Some Lovin, a lovely Wheel, and that amazing Watchtower before what felt like the most achingly-slow Black Peter brought me back to earth only to be shot back into the stratosphere with Around>Sugar Mags. Love love love this show!!! Still gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it.",

      "review_text": "Alpine Dead You just had to be there. Everything seemed to come together, separate and join back together. My first Dead show and glad it was. A very light jazzy energy vibe that night and the scene was truly the way I like to remember the Dead experience. So glad I got to experience this instead of the post '92 scene. Changed the way I experienced music here after. Thank God for The Grateful Dead, one of the great American adventures! The quality really doesn't capture the show. I believe, this was around the time the phased Healy out on sound. I'm not surprised there's no board around. The Eyes, Estimate, China/Rider & Wheel really were great performances. If a board ever ends up surfacing, people will see this in a different light.",

      "review_text": "Great show great scene I remember the telepathy going around that show after the goony birds (I think?).  Circles of people drawing on themselves with glow sticks (not the tubes, actual phosphorescent bars) and beckoning me to join them.  I should have, I ended up driving my friends up the wall for the rest of the night. Then Estimated->Eyes->Drumspace hit and I was gone.  First show, first trip.  Would give a five, but for sound quality it gets a four.  Waiting for decades for someone to produce a soundboard of this show.  Alas it is probably not to be.",
