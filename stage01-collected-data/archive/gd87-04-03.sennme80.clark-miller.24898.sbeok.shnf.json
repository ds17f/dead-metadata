      "review_text": "A worthy addition to anyone's late 80s canon 1st Set: The tape cuts into the opening chord of \"Hell.\" It's strong but not as overwhelmingly so as the version from the Spectrum. \"Sugaree,\" however, is fabulous. I equate it to a lady's swaying, well-shaped muscular thigh. \"CC\" charges into your heart. \"Roses\" is decent, but strains to sound achingly pretty. 'Hell' made this crowd rowdy, and the Dead now respond with a version of \"All Over Now\" that's skippy, (pumped M hammond @ bridge) but is a step behind the coherent infuriated force that would overwhelm the expectant crowd. Surprisingly, the tone is kept speedy with a bristling, if not cleanly crisp, \"Big Railroad.\" \"Let it Grow\" starts off powerfully urgent and continues to Electrify. \"Ease\" caps this solid opening set nicely.\n\nSet Two: Whoooh, does \"China\" heat up, or what?! It does settle for a rolling power groove, but if Garcia would have kept going higher with those ? chords, I might of... YES to \"Rider\" too and I'm jumping and strutting...\"Man Smart\" keeps the place moving and the smiles beaming. \"Crazy\" is the requisite ballad, and is well-performed, but will Not be remembered. It gently leads to a Friday edition of religion. \"Samson\" is keenly played as well, Jerry having some fun with some extra superfulous strumming to egg the crowd on. \"Drums\" & \"Space\" are both abbreviated... tho it leads to a mildly chaotic yet always dynamic \"OO.\" \"Wharf\" attracted my sympathies... it's been a full force gig, therefore-sympathy is deserving for such a hard-fought yet fruitless tale of one of life's losers. Anyways, \"Throwing\" is a blockbuster...passionately rendered, (if the groove during the buildup is not as primitive as others.) \"NFA\" is decent, but we all know the show's climax was \"Throwing.\" And our encore is your basic enjoyable throwaway, 'US Blues'",

I remember all the other kids were spending insane money on tuxes, limos, prom tix, dates, etc. They all complained that the prom \"sucked\". Alot of money and time spent for it to \"suck\".\nNow me on the other hand, I had the best band for a prom I can think of... Killer show! I was a newbie deadhead at this point. I started seeing the Dead in 86. Was at all three of these shows, this was the best one in my opinion. Great subtle, bluesy show and tight all around. Smokin' \"All over Now\", \"Big RR Blues\", \"Let it Grow\" and a sweet \"MHBTRoses\". Nice tight high energy first set.\nThis was a smooth \"China/Rider\" for my first one. Nice humble start to \"Women\". The \"Crazy Fingers\" that night practically had me in tears it was so beautiful, and still gets me \"all misty -eyed\" at times when I wear this tape out. The Samson just emerged without the signature drum intro. The space was unique, almost like they were teetering on a \"Spanish Jam\" but not, into a stellar \"Other One\" which had amazing dynamic range from beginning to end. The \"Wharf Rat\" that night really got me liking that song. Powerful \"Throwing Stones\" and \"NFA\". \"US Blues\" as the encore was the Jerry cherry on top of this proverbial psychadelic sundae.

That sense of carefree abandon, the Boys providing the space, time, and creative musical tapestries for a night of serious fun.  Hell, I'll say it, they encouraged a sense of brotherhood among all us Heads, (and what band can say they carried any sense of brotherhood for 30 years?). Strangers became friends, rhythm became dance, music became mantra, and thought gave way to surrender, clarity, and understanding. Seriously! Sure, we all went at times to just lose it, or just to dance, but I would guess most DeadHeads can say they had more than a few of those enlightening moments.  Yea, it was a big party, but also with the Dead there was such a strong undercurrent of 'hey, let's grow our consciousness while we're together for a short while.' \nThe show!: Gotta say I loved it from start to finish. Sugaree got everyone groovin' if you weren't already, the place did go nuts. And the rest of the set was awesome, especially Let it Grow. 2nd set was smokin', when they're on every song sounds great! Of  course, one of the more vivid memories is Jerry expressing how he wished he was a headlight.. with such power we all got the message!  U.S.Blues sent us out into the streets still hopping.  \nGood times..\n\nStill Grateful",

The first Worcester Show has an outstanding \"Scarlet-Fire\" and a killer \"Black Peter\" -- the \"Black Peters\" on this tour are amazing, as are the \"Birdsongs.\" The two nights at Hartford before Worcester are both outstanding too, maybe the best of the year -- the whole tour rocks.

You hear it immediately with Hell in a bucket, the supporting riffs from all corners.  Jerry really nails the hyperdrive section on sugaree, and this relatively brief version just shines.  The first 4 songs, set 1, and the latter half of set 2 have multiple portions where Jerry gets going, and occasionally Brent, and the other maties just jump right on board.

We hadn't seen anything remotely like it before -- people twirling in the hallways of the arena, the smell of weed wafting in the halls, calls for \"gooney birds\" and kind people handing out \"fresh baked without air\" and other assorted stickers. We were hooked.   Zack, we later learned, promptly took a hit of acid and vanished, only to re-emerge at the end of the show with one shoe.  My brother and I were far more tame, being \"good kids\", nervous about meeting our parents on time and awed by the majesty of the marvelously energetic swirling dancing circus.  The experienced heads next to our seats were concerned we were  runaways and offered us a place to stay if we needed one.  We assured them our parents would pick us up after the show but asked for help figuring out which song was the encore (so young and inexperienced were we).  At the encore, we left, eventually found our parents and Zack (who emerged dazed and covered with stickers) and zoomed home.  A great introduction to a lasting passion.

This show is garbage..I saw well over 300 shows and I gotta tell you, after seeing them blow minds at the shows I attended from '72-'74, and after seeing so many phenomenal shows from '79-'85, seeing the band after Jerry's coma in '86 was very, very hard to take.  The shows were so bad.  Garcia was such a different guitarist.  It was sad.  I give them a ton of credit for hanging in there.  It's a miracle Garcia was able to play at all after July of '86.  But seriously, the shows really sucked, too short and they went nowhere.  Too many lame Dylan covers, no improv, low energy, a thin sound, silly covers like Hand Jive.  The biggest problem was Garcia was never the same after '86.  I tried listening to a Bird Song from '87 the other day, I had to turn it off. Garcia did absolutely nothing and the band kept trying to make it sound like they were doing things on stage.  It was all fluff and the new wave fans bought it.  Us old time real Heads couldn't stand it. The Other One in this show sounds down right stupid.  Nothing like the screaming versions of prior years. Also after '86 the crowds became a real big problem, all the new-wave fans from the in the dark era who had no clue what the Dead was about were real idiots.  The Centrum shows in '83 and '85 were fantastic, check those out not these lame shows.  It is amazing the difference from '85 to '87, just two years later the crowd were a bunch of jerks and the band sucked.",

The fascist boundaries which got set up by cultish, judgmental heads like you CREATED the collapse in the social environment around the Grateful Dead in the '90s. There is so much evidence for this that I could write a book of 100 pages without ever using my own opinions about it. By itself, the fact that you have no ear for music at all should show that whatever the act of going to a Dead concert was for you, it was NOT for the music. To demonstrate this, I cite your comment comparing Garcia's skill with the guitar in the '71-'72 era and post-'86 era. While he was very capable in both eras, anyone who knows anything technically about musical skill (and knowing requires LISTENING) will tell you that Garcia was VASTLY better on guitar post-'86. Subjective preferences about the length of the shows and other qualities are maybe another matter, but since your perceptions are already in question...\n\nThe worst thing that ever happened to the Grateful Dead as a musical experience was the objectification of a surrounding \"family\" or \"community\", which is a thing in space that a) is an object, b) has an inside smaller than its outside, and therefore c) exists primarily for the purposes of exclusion. \n\nListening to music is not a community. It is a collective activity. You shouldn't have to be any kind of person to be able to listen to tunes. Collective activities are open and inclusive and judge no one. Communities are conservative, reactionary and fascist, like your comments. Seriously, go read some books about people who used to talk like you in Germany in the 1930s. \n\nAnd now the show: Only heard the first set so far, but it's actually a scorcher, and I like this recording best out of all the others currently available, by a pretty narrow margin. But listen for yourself and don't try to be a Deadhead. It's a shame about them. So mellow, yet so weirdly uptight. It was possible to go see a show without letting them ruin the experience, but not easy.\n\nPS: yeah, the second set rocks also. More about the recording: very clear and tone-rich.

Go listen to PITB from Ventura 8/27/72 and then tell me he approached anything NEAR that good in that song post- '86. PLEASE.\n\nAs for \"Donna sucked\", I'm sorry you think the touch-heads \"ruined\" things for \"real\" fans like you, but a lot of those folks loved the band every bit as much as you did, and while technically Garcia and the other band members may not have been \"better\" players in the late years, they certainly DID take the songs in new and needed directions that were fresh and better for the times in which they were played. A lot of portions of those versions of The Other One you love so much in the early 70's did suffer from over-indulgence of feedback and noodling nonsense that may look good on paper at 29 minutes long but are vastly improved on as leaner, meaner, more focused vehicles in the 80's and 90's...the songs needed to be stripped down of their more indulgent aspects in those years and they were better for it for those times.\n\nSo both of you need to realize you're not speaking for all Heads of ANY generation when you spout such non-toleant nonsense on these reviews. Shows like this one have their moments of pure joy, while they never can in fact reach the overall heights of their counterparts from 15 years previous,\n\nThis show is a solid 3 stars, by the way. It'll never replace a June Winterland '77 run show, for example, but it has some fine bright spots. Enjoy it for what it is, and ignore the frothing at the mouth from the rest.",

Yes there were some epic shows in the 60's and 70's, but I personally think to say that Brent was a bad vocalist or keyboardist is just ignorant.",

So much power, energy, and boot stompin' FUN as Jerry and the boys rock and roll their way through the night!",

Does if matter to any listener that a reviewer thinks the current song being reviewed doesnt stand up the the same song fom yesteryear. probabley not. If this show was so important that another person \"got on the bus\" then that is a beautiful thing. What's the point of spreading negative shit at the cost of someonelse.\nMost importantly, thank you for taking the time to download this show for our listening pleasure. Good Night!",

His stage presence and energy in many ways would  never be as  strong and present as it was on this tour.\n\nHe loved being  back and  his playing, along with the band, exemplifies it magnificently.\n\nNo there is no long jams this tour instead you get  classic 1980's Garcia powering through songs with  gusto and the  band hanging on for  dear life.\n\nJust listen to All Over Now.\n\nMany folks have given you the details on the music but listening to this show simply transports  you  back to the time when  we all knew we almost  lost Jerry and thank goodness we did not as he was far from finishing his musical legacy.\n\nI will note that the Wharf  Rat is stunning.\n\nUS Blues has  Jerry laying down the satire in a  big way and  you can feel his big ole grin the entire  time.",

Anyone who thinks otherwise listens to GD for selfish reasons, letting their own experience (i.e., ego) get in the way.  Fortunately for us, life isn't about them. So spout your hate filled negativity and I'll keep smiling, because I know I'm after a specific mindset when I listen to GD -- even when they play in 2015.",

I coulda been more dosed off of sniffin my own farts because the doses were weak and you wanna talk about weak - how bout this?  This show was weak.  And i don't mean day of the week - i mean WEAK.  yes dead heads they stunk real bad this night and Jerry's habit of running off stage to smoke crack was apparent in the music.  worst damn show i ever went to.  Jerry was turned low, Bobby sounded like a crazed serial monster and Brent was about the only on point dude here.  I kinda feel Brent shoulda been the only member of the band here.  Maybe bring in Billy Joel's back up band to fill in the blanks.  The dead called this one in on a phone.  Sham eful waste of a show.",

They were tight night after night, and engaged with the music and the audience.  This particular show is an example of the high quality of the Spring 87 tour.   And this particular recording is as good an audience tape as you'll ever hear.  Listen in particular to the \"Wharf Rat\", which is  a highlight of the show.",

And Bobby and Jerry forgot a verse to one song every other night. We saw Brent- huge fan by the way, in the bar at the Hilton after... He was so loaded he couldn't see. Fell off his bar stool. If u think this show sucked, what ones do think are really good. Like I'm a huge fan of Santana Red Rocks but the music wasn't that great...

It was a tough ticket to get at the time of the great Grateful Dead surge in the late 80's into the early 90's. Still phenomenal any person that can't feel the energy I feel compassion for. You see this problem with many people so consumed with negative thought patterns in the mind. This 7 years up to Garcia's death were surreal happy moments. Just amazing shows with Brent in the zone.

There seemed to be more people looking for tickets than usual. \n\nThe two things I remember most were being disappointed with HIAB to open and pumped for seeing US Blues live. \n\nIn this era, you never knew if you would get an average show or a tight, high energy performance.
