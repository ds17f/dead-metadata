However, I must say that after the other shows I've seen and now have been hearing via archive, this show certainly meets a 4-5 star standard.  Lots of good energy here, and a particularly kind groove.  The show was hot...really, I mean it was hot that day!  Second set brought a somewhat unique funk feel.  Cardinal Stadium was packed, and was the first and only time the GD played it.  This is certainly a very good pick from what panned out to be a very nice summer tour.",

I had the feeling dancing my ass off in what used to be the fifth row before the chairs were all stacked that I was hearing a legendary show being performed that day.  I could exhaust the remaining bandwidth on this site writing about the experiences of that day.  The highlights begin with the first song and end with the encore.  JToo many things to mention...However, if you want to hear an extraordinarily blissful transition from Chinacat into Rider, look no further.  The jam out of He's Gone is impossible to put into words.  Bob left the stage thinking drums was certainly up now, but Jerry wouldn't quit and launched into a Birdsong type jam (the strumming jam Jerry would do towaqrds the end of Birdsong in the late 80's), toying with the Other One as well.  \n\nTruly an amazing show...",

All kinds of memories came flowing back from that special night.\n\nI drove up from knoxville and met some friends there.  I recall some girl freaking out, rolling all over the gravel parking lot naked and bruising herself all up, all the while yelling, \"Get away, I'm saving myself for Bobby Weir.\"  Anyway, she seemed to be having a bad trip.  We sat very near the front, seemed like on folding chairs but right in front of the left stack of speakers and the sound was LOUD.  I remeber Brent really looking out of it and seemed to be competing for licks that night, but the performance was top notch and Jerry was right on...the boys really rocked.  Especially the long and incredible jam from He's Gone into Drums where I thought any moment they were going to go into The Other One was something special.  To be honest, it could really be called \"The Other One Jam.\"  First and last time I've ever heard the Dead do something like this.  I believe Hornsby played on most of this too along with Brent, but my memory's a bit fuzzy there.  This was a venue that you wouldn't expect the Dead to play and we were delighted that we could get up there in a few hours and see our favorite band.  \n\nThe sound quality of this recording is really really hot as is the performance.

Brent and Jerry's musical conversations during this instrumental piece will reduce your cerebral cortex to a puddle of Dr. Hoffman's Wonder juice. I was giving the 2nd set a first listen while behind the wheel last night. By about 30 seconds into this \"Smokestackish\" jam I was forced to pull over. There I sat in a donut shop parking lot eyes closed, volume up, marbles lost, cruising the inner stratosphere. \n\nIt's been 20 years since I first set sail on the good ship Grateful Dead.

Heat index had to be about 110+. The venue had cold water sprayers in the back for people to come and cool off. I remembered an 'Alligator' tease tucked away somewhere in one of those jams also. Unforunate that the Dead wont allow the downloads anymore. This was gonna be second on my list, after Deer Creek 90'. I cried like a baby during the 'Dew' @ Deer Creek.

Pulled a lot out before they switched their policy, I'll regret not getting this one forever.\n\nThis was the show that afterward, I reached into my pockets and pulled out all the money I had left to my name, which was $110, and turned to my friends and said, \"Ok I got $110 and a full tank of gas. Whose going to Carolina w/ me.\"\nThe rest is history.",

I do remember the dancing skeleton--at Three Rivers one of the legs fell off (perhaps during Eyes, or was it Lovelight?). Another random fact I remember about this tour was that Jerry had a very short haircut.  \n\nThis show--especially the second set--is tremendous.  Ramble on Rose (especially Jerry's MIDI effects) is the first set highlight for me.  China>Rider and He's Gone>Jam are obviously exceptional, but Truckin' and GDTRFB are flawless as well.  \n\nWish I had made it to this show, but I'm lucky I caught what I did on this tour!!

After the show I started having having auditory hallucinations. The music on the radio sounded backwards. Terrapin arrived. The people I was with had never tripped, it was disastrous. My life changed forever. Enough said.\n\nNow, about the show...I remember, like others, it was scorching hot outside, but the music rolled like cool water. I danced like a madman, soaking in every note, every scene. I guess only those who know understand this sort of thing. It is difficult describing it.\n\nThe energy during the jam was crazy. The Other One pushed hard, but then pulled back. Anticipation filled the stadium. Part of the animation I recall clearly. After Baby Blue this skeleton hand appeared curling it's bony finger like someone wanting you to come with them. I remember talking to a others after the show about the tunes we thought were going to happen but didn't. \n\nThis show sits with me every time I listen to the Dead. Glad to find it!",

After the \"run for the roses\" '89 Freedom Hall show (same location as Cardinal Stadium, on the State Fairgrounds) my brother and I were stoked to have the Boys back in KY! Things outside the venue were not nearly as cool as the April '89 show...Heat and MORE HEAT! On to the show...the Picasso Moon in the first set was awesome, with the full moon already visible in the early evening sky.  A killer Music Never Stopped to end the first set. I vividly remember how the colors of the stage set-up blended and changed as the sun went down, with planes landing at the airport in the distance beyond. Could have been affected by the \"airplane\" paper we ingested. I'll let the other reviews speak for how incredible the 2nd set was....other than during Standing on the Moon, Jerry had the full moon straight in front of him. Must have been inspired! I was. They probably took extra pleasure in playing Around and Around, because they certainly had everyone's head spinning after THAT monster set. Now go find your car, sell some spaghetti from the trunk, and we'll see you next time!",

I could not believe the stuff they were doing onstage. Even Jerry was in shorts with some weird little slip on loafers. And let me tell you , the man and the band were on fire here. Jerry was smiling , laughing talking to Brent and just having fun. Ive been to my fair share of shows and something about this one burned into my brain. \nThe first set was great , a few clunkers in there except for West LA which was awesome. Sugaree too. \nNow the 2nd set is a whole different beast altogether. A great China - Rider and Standing on the Moon was inspired by Jerry. He was really singing well here and he nailed it. He was back on one leg jamming!Then there is the jam they do after He's Gone- it is like The Dead from 1973. They just start playing and 10 minutes later you realize you have seen one of Jerrys best performances . Then they still play D/S and more after that. You can really hear Bobby playing perfectly along with Jerry and of course Brent is incredible as usual. 5 stars for performance , 5 stars for crispy sbd recording!

I got in to the stadium just before the first set and found an usher to help me get to my seat because the band was already on stage tuning up. The usher led me down in front of the first row, and before we got to the center aisle to cut up to the 4th row the band launched into Hell In a Bucket, and it was pure pandemonium.

Edited on September 26, 2024 All I have to say this time is I REALLY MISSED THIS SHOW being here on the Archive!! It was released commercially as a \"Dave's Picjs\" or something similar. Not positive. But YEAH, I was at this show AND it was A REALLY GREAT SHOW!!! Definitely comparative to Spring '90 Shows! And it was the very first time I took my 1979 Camaro on a road trip. See the previous story that comes after this!!!\nJuly 23,2020\nAbout  2 weeks b4 this show, I got my income tax $ & bought myself a really nice '79 Camaro. And then a few days b4 this show a friend of mine by the name of Mark Wilhoit told my brother & I that he had 3 tix. And that if we drove & would help pay for a hotel room we could all 3 go. We were both like \"YES, we can do that! Sounds great!\" First road trip in my camaro. So the day before the show we leave Lithonia, GA (right outside Atlanta) and truck on up to Louisville! We get off the interstate & happen to notice Alice's Restaurant. We pull in & go in & ask for a yellow pages. I order a desert too while we are figuring out what hotel we're going to stay at & how to get there. When we finally get to the Holiday Inn this major electrical storm is blowing into the area. We are up on the 8th floor and for a good 2 to 3 hours there is this awesome air to ground lightning. Huge lightning bolts just over & over & over again. I think there was a tornado as well\nOk, we smoke a couple doobies and crash so we can be ready for the show the next day.\n     We get up & get to the show without incident, but the lot is full. So they have us park beside the road. There are people parked on the grass as well too. Well anyway, I've been  parked for about 10 or 15 mins when a guy pulls up, gets out & says \"Hey, is that your car?\" And I said \"Yeah\". He said \"Well, there is still a space over there next to the fence. If you move your car so I can pull over there, I have a N2O tank, we will sit & do balloons until show time\". I said \"Ok, sounds like a good plan\". And moved my car, he pulled in, and I pulled back in. And we set out a few blankets & introduced everybody to everybody & cranked up some tunes & began to get baked. I think the thermometer hit 106 that day. Not a cloud in the sky. Hell, we had already had a really good time b4 we dosed & went inside the show. This was maybe my 7th or 8th Dead show. And considering that we were in the outfield, & I was dosed pretty well, I knew I had seen a Dead show but, at the time, I didn't think this show was anything out of the ordinary for the Grateful Dead. But it was the first time I had ever seen them play in a stadium. When the show was over, I had to help a guy jumpstart his car cuz he ran his battery down cranking music all day. When we got back to the hotel we all 3 realized that we all looked like ripe tomatoes, we were so sunburned!! So we had the hotel give us a whole bunch of lotion, which our skin soaked up on nothing flat. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE MADE ME WISH WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT SHOW!!! But, not having enough cash & having a job I needed to get back to, we headed south for Atlanta. My camaro had a clear sun roof. We cut a paper bag open & taped it over the sun roof cuz our sun burnt skin needed no more sun rays. Favorite song for the ride home.....Going down the road feeling bad, going down the road feeling bad, going down the road feeling bad, yeah, yeah, yeah! Don't want to be treated this way.....well that's my story & I'm sticking to it. Do what you will with it. Great show!! Sounds better here than I remember it sounding when I was there! Totally amazed by all the views & reviews this show has gotten!! And lots of love to all who read this. And if you happen to know a tall blonde guy that goes by the name of Mark Wilhoit. Not sure if he still lives near Atlanta cuz I'm in the DC area now, but have him read this. He may get a kick out of it. I got to see Jerry about 65 more times since. And btw, I always remember this concert being at \"Hell in A Bucket\" Stadium!!! That was the perfect song to open this show! Cuz at the time it felt like \"Hell in a Bucket\".",
