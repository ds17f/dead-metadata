Yes, they played slow shows in 76, but this show is not just off tempo (i.e., the band), it's off pitch (i.e.,the recording chain).  I have a variable pitch cd player and can check this within a few seconds against standard pitch as represented by my guitar.  As an Oregonian and a big fan of this era, I've always wished someone would pitch correct this show (we've called it the heroin show for years)so I could listen to it in other locations. I am downloading this now and will check pitch.  If it's slow and Jay finds time, I'm sure we'd all appreciate a pitch-corrected Bertha Remaster.  Thanks for all the Bertha work either way, 5 stars for that!",

Yes, there are definitely copies circulating with a lesser pitch, partly because of that fact my original cassette copy of this show was one of those tapes I reached for before going to bed, or just because I wanted to doze for a awhile.  It always did the trick.  As someone said earlier the Help>Slip>Franklin's takes its' sweet old time and is a classic.   This copy, I believe, is right on the mark.. and yes it sounds a tad slow, but I don't think it is.  All you have to do is reach for your Jerry shows, ala 1/27/76 (don't quote me on the exact date) or something else from the 1st half of 1976 to see the similarities.  God Bless the slow things; it's about time we all slowed down a 1/2 a tick.",

If you listen to a couple of the songs from the AUD versions available in the archive and compare them to these SBDs, the SBDs DO sound a little slow.  Not a lot but I think it's noticeable.  Granted, they were playing stuff a bit slower but it just sounds \"off\" a hair.  \nSounds like a great show though, so I think I'll DL and use CoolEdit to fool with the pitch a little to get it \"absolutely perfect\".\nI gave it a 3 only because I haven't listened to it all yet (and the archive won't accept a review without a rating).",

      "review_text": "Hook, Line, and Sinker... Back in the early ' 90's, when I first started getting into the music of the Grateful Dead, a recently befriended taper handed me a couple of cassette tapes that read simply: PORTLAND 6/3/76. It was a simple and innocuous gesture that, at the time, I thought nothing of. However, as I sit writing this approx. 13-14 years later, I realize that those tapes were my, \"The Bus came by and I got on...\" moment. By the end of Scarlet Begonias I was making plans for Tour.\n   I will let those more qualified argue about whether the pitch, or whatever , is messed up. I'm not here to dissect the songs either, I'm writing this because it was this show: PORTLAND 6/3/76 that transformed me from a dissatisfied, aimless indie-rocker into a passionate, life-long DEADHEAD. On the ride home from my friend's house that day my face was stolen and I will be forever Grateful for it.\n   This show actually rates a four in the context of ' 76 as a whole, but due to its life-changing impact on me personally I am compelled to give it a five.

A few first timers including the sweet sounding Supplication (Bobby peters out on the lyrics, oh well)and a few relatively new to the setlist (eg Crazy Fingers and Help>Slip>Franklin's).  The Slipknot melts into your ears, winding its way through some uncertainty to resolve in some phenomenal jamming.  \n\nEach instrument and vocal track is clear and crisp and the sound is well balanced across all.  I would give it a \"low\" five only because in my mind the best 5s have the great songs that are well played, great sound and some 30 minute type segues (eg, June 9th), whereas this show generally has lots of very good but fairly distinct songs strung back to back.",

Most of the show is first-time material if you include the Blues for Allah songs, which had never been played outside of a handful of San Francisco \"test\" gigs.

      "review_text": "Crazy Search for Crazy Fingers Although I've been a GD fan for years, I've only become an OBSESSIVE one (alright, a Deadhead) for about half a year.  I've downloaded a couple dozen shows ranging from the '60's to the '90's and am happy to be getting a real foothold on this Greatest of Live All Rock Bands after two decades or more of prognasticating and putting off until tomorrow the hard work that you have to do to really understand the Dead today.\n\nAnyway, this is the first review I've posted, thinking I should make a minimal contribution to the Archive in thanks for months of great music and music-inspired thought.  This show from June of '76 is my out-and-out favorite of all the shows I've listened to.  Although '77 seems to be considered the greater Dead year, I have a preference to '76 because Jerry, Bob and Donna are all at their best vocally, I guess as they are coming off their touring break in '75, and because, although '77 saw the addition to the canon of Terrapin Station and Estimated Prophet, the band also dropped (or played less frequently) some of the Blues for Allah material, including Crazy Fingers, which for me is one of the sublime heights of American song (I came across this show, in fact, searching for the ultimate performance of that song, which I indeed found contained herein).  Also, not to continue to slight the '77 shows, the vocals tend to get hidden, whereas, particularly in this show, they're beautifully clear, and you don't have to fight to make out the lyrics (if you're still learning them as I am, that is).\n\nA final note: Some reviewers have commented on the slow speed of the recording of this concert.  If you compare the pitch-level of any given song, however, with, say, that on a corresponding '77 recording, it's only a quarter pitch or less under.  That means that they were simply playing slower than in '77 or even later in June '76.\n\nIn short, if you love '76-'77 GD, download this show now.  Great live music doesn't get better than this!",

I thought Cassidy was nice, too.\nI was looking for a great Lazy Lightning/Supplication and I believe this is the first performance (by the Dead), so I thought this one would be full of fire. But it's pretty disappointing. I can't put my finger on why. Check out Dick's Picks 3 for a great version (best I've found so far).\nScarlet was also a let-down. In fact I couldn't bring myself to listen to more and gave up during Scarlet. It's like the band was pre-occupied with something other than their performance that night.\nI don't blame them. They can't play perfectly every night for 30 years. But I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone.\nThe sound quality is excellent.\nIf someone can recommend a good Lightning, please do.",

Ok well not that bad.  I compared some different versions of Cassidy, playing along with my guitar.  This version was about half a note lower in pitch than the other one.  Sounds a bit weird to my ears.\n\nFirst Lazy->Supplication sounds kinda confused.  Check out 1976-06-29.  By the end of the month they had it down.\n\nIf the sound was adjusted this could be a 5 star show (maybe.)  Right now I give it about 3.75.",

Tapers taped shows or people traded soundboards and you got a cassette(it wasn't that long ago.) It's called a cassette tape player. They cost nothing these days. Or if must you can download a program to record sound (\"Audacity\" etc...) then burn it to cds\n\nBy the way. This show is excellent. Especially because it's just before the cocaine days really went into full swing and bobby and donna started their screaming matches. I personally recommend it.",

A gem of a nice summer day spent with the good ole Grateful Dead in the Bicentenial year after the haitas broke. 8-) Things tended to be a bit laid back in that time.\n\nAs to the recommendation below :\nAudacity is a superb audio program which is fee! It is great to use to record your own music and play with filters, overdubbing, and more. But do not use it, or any other program or hardware, to record these streams!\n\nThese streams are already in lossy format and if you record them you will be recording them in a low bit rate form. If you burn the file(s) to audio disk it will not become lossy just a mp3 disk (it won't look like it but run it through a spectrum analyzer).\n\nIf you then \"convert\" them into a lossy format (ie. : ogg, mp3, m4a, wma, etc..) you will be re-encoding to a much lower bit rate than you think. It will likely sound horrible as well.\n\nIf you make copies of the disk(s) for family/friends/?? you will be polluting the gene pool of what is going around and may/will make some traders and most all taper very angry.\n\nIf you want the sbds there several ways to get them.\n 1. Buy the commercial releases whether on disk or download.\n 2. Trade with someone who has them. They've pretty much all been here or somewhere else already. Many people have them. You just need to return to the old style of trading with friends, through ads and with copy parties. The bonus this time around is no generational loss like in the old days. There are lots of vines, trees and kind folks who'll burn stuff for you so long as you pay for the postage and send blanks. I can't get everyone but you can e-mail me and we can work something out.\n 3. Join one of the reputable torrent sites. There are several, which I won't name, that are run and/or administered by folks very closely tied to this site. If you read many of the reviews or forum posts you'll see them. Stay away from anyplace that's the least bit shady and you'll have no problems with viruses, trojans, etc..",

Mick and Bill haven't quite worked out all the kinks yet and some of the newer songs are tentative such as Lazy Lightning but all in all a good show. The songs are sometimes taken at the slower '76 tempo and it works for some such Slipknot and the gorgeous Crazy Fingers which really groove nicely. But it doesn't work for others. It Must Have Been The Roses was slow and boring to begin with, and it's just that much slower and boring. Sorry I know some folks love that song, I've never liked it. One More Saturday Night would benefit from a faster tempo as well, that song needs more pep. \nHighlights include the new version of Dancing, Crazy Fingers, a nice Scarlet and Samson and Delilah is excellent. A transitional show (hey it's a first pancake after a long absence) from a transitional year but definitely worth listening to. Sound quality is very good as well.",

By the way these shows have been traded in the public domain for many years. If you download shows that have not been released commercially you are not breaking copyright laws. Throughout this website I'm constantly reading reviews critical of the sound of mp3. While it's true that a computer analyzer can tell the difference human ears cannot. If you have the right software and know how to set it up you can make wonderful sounding mp3 discs. I've played the FLAC versions of these shows for many people and the mp3 versions. I have yet to find anyone who can consistently tell the difference. mp3 was developed by the motion picture industry so the soundtrack could be put on DVD. mp3 stands for motion picture 3. 3 meaning the third track. When you go to the movies or watch a DVD do you like the way it sounds? Guess what? It's mp3. I'm tired of people spreading the myth that mp3 sounds bad. Every now and then someone will be at my house and I'll mention mp3. Often they say they sound terrible. I then put on an mp3 disc and tell them it's in lossless format. After they go on and on about how much better it sounds than mp3 I reveal my little secret and shut them up. If you don't want to listen to mp3 that's okay by me but stop spreading this silly myth!!!",

Second, slow means pitch is off, in this case by almost 1/2 step. We do not do the trading pool justice by fatalistically dismissing these problems as some inherent unrepairable flaw in the medium of tape generally.\n\nThis is probably a cool show, but don't trust this source ...",
