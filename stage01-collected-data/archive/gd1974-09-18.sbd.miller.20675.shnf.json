As terrible as the French was, this show is an incredible ride from start to finish. \nThe first set alone is incredible with outstanding versions of Friend Of The Devil (listen to that fantastic, bouncy rhythm), Black Throated Wind and Scarlet Begonias. A gorgeous TLMD and a superb Playin' jam.\nThe second set starts off with what could be my favourite Loose Lucy they had been playing with the rhythm over the last few months and finally they perfected it (with a minimum of the cheezy background vocals). Absolutely outstanding version of Eyes with one of those 74 Slipknot squiggles and a jazzy, exploratory Caution jam.\nEver moment of this show is gripping.\nThanks, Charlie Miller.",

      "review_text": "Les Fran\u00e7ais aiment le Grateful Dead. Back in the early '80's the first set of this tape was in heavy circulation and an exceptional sounding one at that. All tapers had this one and it is clear to me nowit was from this same source. This set and the high pitched June Louisvillle show were played to death in my cassette deck and began my  love affair with this unique sounding and amazing year.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned the first set may be the best one, from start to finish, from this year. It opens with maybe the only time Uncle John's Band would ever open a show until the 15th anniversay shows of 1980 in Boulder, CO.\nThe last time they palyed it as an opener I believe 8/23/71?\n\nPhil Lesh is so strong this entire show and it begins the instant after Jerry strums those familar opening chords, Phil literally plays an opening lead.This version is a pinnacle reading of this classic too.\nThey bring it to a complete stop, which is how it was played often back then, and then begin a lilting and majestically transforming Jack Straw.\nJerry phrasing is just spectatular on this one, easily one of  my  favorite  versions, as this one is a true psychedellic dream. Follow this up with a sing-a-long dance-a-long reading of FOTD and this night is already heading toward mythical ethos.\nNext comes a  fantastic and emotionally packed BT Wind then the goods keep on coming with an upbeat and sparkling rendition of Scarlet Begonias, featuring excellent playing on the Moog by Keith.\nKeith continues to switch between the Moog and piano the rest of the show.\nLucky us.\nI love this  set and will not  get caught up in hyberpole, everything is played with that extra magic and sweeteness.\nThis could not be better represented by one of the most enduring and sweeping versions of To Lay Me Down ever.\nYou next get the \" standard\" PITB set closer, but hold on folks, no one has yet mentioned this before and to my ears I hear something  very funky in the end jam, that could  lead one to believe that Jerry may have stumbled onto the beginings of Shakedown Street this night.\nIt is something that they  toy with for a  minute or two and I always thought that whenever I've listen to this show.\nI would be curious what others think?\nIt ends triumpantly with a uplifting Reprise to end this special set.\n\nContinuing with the Phil Lesh  theme, this show included 13 minutes, of Ned and Phil.\nI would love to read reviews of the scene inside the show when these sets were played.\nThis one is actually quite cerebral and I enjoyed it.\n\nSet II tragically, begins with serious technical problems with the vocals for the first two songs. They are great versions and the band always made up musically when this did occurred.\nIt seems this was an issue when they played Loose Lucy since the Louisville experienced  a similar fate too.\n\nAnother fun fact of this grand show is the amounts of ballads Jerry plays, there are six in total, and the Peggy-O that is featured this night is stunning and heartfelt.\nYou know Jerry was relaxed and grounded as he went more for sweetness rather than mind melt this night. \nThe Eyes, is very  good, not as  deep as other  versions from this year but the ending is extremely well played as Phil continues to make his presence felt, this flows very nicely into ballad number four, China Doll.\n\nI am sure there were many heads who were at the '72 shows and this may  explain Jerry's trifeca, ending with ballad number five He's Gone. A stand up version with everything you would want out of this classic.\nPig Pen must of smiled on this one.\nThe band jams out of this into traditional rave up version of Truckin' and next is where the acknowledgement and respect for a fallen brother comes screaming through.\nThe jam has Phil teasing Caution almost from the start but Jerry and Keith first prefer to explore some jazz influenced themes first. Once again Keith is on the Moog and he  shines on it. It is about at the six minute mark that both Jerry and Keith finally take Phil's cues and launch into a  full blown dive into Caution.\nObviously this would not come to full rendition this night until late next month when the band returned home to close out the Winterland run, but this one is excellent and the audience loves it.\nJerry then surprises with a late set Ship of Fool, ballad number six,which with the previous jam and the He's Gone might be more of a band confessional on how \" they\" might have  intervened more on Pig Pen's behalf to save him from a sad and painful fate.\n\nThe band next goes old school with a JBG to end the set.\n\nThe US Blues is standard fare but the audience loves it and  you can hear their devotion and excitement bleed through the vocal mikes.\nAs mentioned before Phil tries to be the gracious host and acknowledge the loyal and grateful French audience for this historic night of music.\nIt was rare for Phil to speak and when he did it meant he had a  wonderful  time playing.\nCheck out 5/15/77 for what I mean.\n\nVive les sentiers de Grateful Dead et heureux de vous jusqu'\u00e0 ce que nous nous reverrons.",

So good to hear this in all its full glory.\nI can't exactly put my finger on it but there is something about the sound and musical space the Dead are in circa 74.\nAs already commented on the set list for the 1st set is just top shelf. I almost feel like it is an acoustic set yet they are electric and trippy almost hypnotic in places.\nThere are spots were Keith sounds like Ned might be sitting in or at minimum Keith is tinkering with something besides a piano.\nPhil's bass is just so front and center. I have to be honest I don't remember Phil this high up in the mix when I was going to shows in the 80's.\nThe vocals here are very good as well. I just like the way everyone picks each other up no matter who is singing lead.\nAnd then of course there is Garcia. I am not sure how anyone can be compared to Jerry. He was the lifeblood of the band when I was going to shows and here he is just simply other worldly.\nMuch credit also to Billy who is able to twist and turn the bus give it the gas or jam on the brakes.\nPretty sure that is a Shakedown jam in the Playin around 13 minutes in. Or at least the seeds for it.",

      "review_text": "9th Trip Around the Sun Choice, nearly 10-minute UJB show opener- that's featured on the 30 trips definitive live story. Last time opened was 8/23/71 and the next time would be 6/8/80- actually its last in the show opening slot. The sweet '74 goodness just keeps coming and the band keeps on giving: check out the great versions of FOTD - first since 12/11/72, 108 shows - BTW, Jimmy, TLMD, and the closing 23-minute PITB. Check out Stellablu122's review. Possible proto-Shakedown jam at around 12:28? I don't know, but definitely right to point out that there's - count 'em - six Garcia ballads at this show. Wow. Next comes a \"shorter\" 1.5 set that has Phil and Ned clocking in at around 13 minutes. Second set is all-star, highlighted by the late-set Truckin'->Jam. Here's what as1307 has to say about it (from the earlier 2004 Charlie Miller transfer):  \n\n\"ok...it's about 23 minutes long and features a drums/bass segment and what is labeled as the caution jam. i will mention that very early on, weir introduces the mind left body theme and garcia is right there with him, all over it, before lesh begins the 'caution' bass. so for a couple of minutes you get this MLB/caution hybrid jam (see 10/18/78 for the mojo/MLB mix...). its already cliche to call godchaux's rhodes playing during this era hancock-esque but really it is, and this whole jam has a strong bitchs-brew era electric miles feel (actually, the whole thing reminds me of 'pharoahs dance' off that record). great jam that actually gets pretty frenzied at its climax, with very very strong playing by everyone. amazing, really.\"",

Almost wish there was a good AUD mix rather than what so much of the '74 shows ended up sounding like on the SBD masters.  The recent '73-'74 Pacific Northwest Boxed Set packaged shows how good these shows were with a good audio mix. Nevertheless, this is a great show and very enjoyable to listen to.",

      "review_text": "Les sons t'endents <br />This was at Parc des Expositions de Dijon, probably in the center hall, not the 600-seat theater [which is newer, and the stage plan wouldn't allow the WoS footprint]. Bringing the giant WoS to another continent was a logistical hydra and they ended up with just four stops. They had hoped to play Arles, since they had never played down in Mediterranean France. But the booking fell through, dashing Riviera dreams, and a promoter arranged this show in Dijon, in east-central France, to fill a six-day gap before Paris. The band's management were all fired or quit after the show in Bavaria, so they had to get themselves to this show and, as often happened in those days, the promoter tried to stiff the band (Billy flashed a blade). Due to short notice, lack of marketing, or just the small market, only a few hundred people turned up. Unlike E72, E74 & the WoS lost money. This is probably the 4th best of the seven E74 shows. There's a crisp Kidd C. SBD with tunings and regular FM versions. The former is a very clear recording for the Wall of Sound, which usually has that weird, muddy sound on the vox and a lack of clarity on the individual instruments.\n\nFirst Set. <i>Uncle John's Band</i> is uptempo (even after pitch correction). It's a decent opener - it's the early jam slot that makes it good. On <i>Jack Straw</i> you get the drumming that didn't exist in the two-drummer era. X factor arrives with a wonderful <i>Friend of the Devil</i>. You will notice it sounds different. That's because they hadn't played it since 11Dec72, but I also suspect this is a version to interest French fans familiar with the album version, to give them a hand onto the bus. All four versions from '74 use this arrangement, but the other three don't have the charm of this comeback. Compare it to a few shows down the line, on 10/19. <i>Black-Throated</i> is the average run-through but this <i>Scarlet Begonias</i> is one to behold. Jer sometimes made little exclamation points, like the chirp after \"heart of gold band\"; after which he rides his volume knob for another golden moment. A fave of '74 (along with 6/28, 9/11, 9/18...). <i>Row Jimmy</i> is solid. Phil says, \"Le patter...le patter. Les sons t'endents? Le patter!\". It's a meta-joke. But there's a problem mixing-in English like this, because in French it sounds like \"Laisson tes dents le parterre!\". Puzzled Dijonnais may have heard \"Leave your teeth on the floor\". It probably should be \"Ces sons que tu entends? Bavardage!\" Or maybe Phil was just a fan of JFK's doughnut. <i>Beat it on Down the Line</i>-5/7 and the next couple are average '74, whereas <i>To Lay Me Down</i> is perfect...and very dry. Though not on par with the best of '74, <i>Playin' in the Band</i> is  a must-hear-once, with its varied pieces.\n\nSecond Set. After <i>Loose Lucy</i> has a false start [mic problem], it turns into Stars and Stripes Forever, then briefly a Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1. Tech issues keep things from being ironed out, so it's a wash. There are still tech issues marring <i>Big River</i>. The mics are finally fixed for <i>Peggy-O</i>, but it's way downtempo and flat. <i>Me & My Uncle</i> is just the thing for it - a snappy version propelled by just Billy, plus Keith playing wonderful barrelhouse piano. <i>Eyes of the World</i> is great even though it's a little forced compared to the two previous shows. It will still melt yo' face. As with much of the show, Phil dominates. There's a very nice seg into <i>China Doll</i>, but it then gets messy with Jer clipping off measures and Phil/Billy having to add or drop beats.  <i>He's Gone</i> is potent as a whole - Bobby adds much here - but I don't think it matches, say, 7/29 or 10/17. <i>Truckin'</i> is a bit thin during verses, with several flubs, but it gains a stride during the jam (which is also not the tightest). Phil backs Billy on <i>Drums</i>, then Jer comes out, and what you get is more of a unique jam than a \"Drums\"; then out comes Bobby, who starts a Mind Left Body [two shows in a row, both more or less out of Truckin']. Phil soon starts a Caution, or tries, and for awhile you get a blend of MLB/Caution. Note that in '74 Phil split his strings into stereo - he's doing it, and not the soundboard/mixer (in person anyway). This was the first <i>Caution</i> since the last Europe tour (11May72 w/Pigpen), though it's really just a Caution-structured jam. The real return of Caution is 10/19. But this sequence is a must-hear-once. There's recognition from the punters at <i>Ship of Fools</i>, so <b>Mars Hotel</b> must have been available in France (it barely was in the U.S.). Luckily for those that already had it (to presumably familiarize themselves before the show), five of its songs were played. These last few are middling fare; and with the encore, like much of the show the previous night was the big one. Et bon nuit \u00e0 tu.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nFriend of the Devil - whether French aimed or not\nScarlet Begonias - one of year's best\nMe & My Uncle - one drummer snap & barrelhouse  \nEyes of the World - melted faces and Phil dominant\n\nSOURCES: The miller_20675 is the remaster of miller_20732. A few tunings are trimmed and these run a little fast, needing <u>-1% pitch correction</u>, as does the official release. Sometimes <b>30 Trips</b> has longer tunings and other times the SBD does. The bertha-ashley_21925 is an EQd version. The jeffm_3398 runs too fast. The miller_32292 is the soundcheck, if you wanna check those sounds. Uncle John's is on <b>Definitive Live Story</b>. There is a bootleg vinyl from the '80s (\"Crazy Fingers\"). The spine says Jamaica 11/26/82, the center labels say Paris '74, but the tracks play stuff from this show.",
