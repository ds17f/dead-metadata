February 5, 1978 was remembered as the coldest night of the year that winter, but that was easy to forget in the light, airy confines of the UNI Dome [one of those structures whose ceiling is supported by forced air pressure].\n\nHow did Jerry do it?  A beam reflected from a spotlight on his guitar seemed to spread its blessings across every individual in the audience.  For \"Truckin'\" another spot illuminated the semi pulled up next to the stage, and it was all I could do to resist that roadie fantasy of mine.

He takes four verses, each one better than the last, a masterful bit of storytelling.  The Scarlet-Fire is beautifully paced, and Garcia's improvisations at the end of Fire are truly inspired.  And probably the longest Samson ever (Weir forgets the first verse, and has a heckuva time getting the song back from Garcia, who nearly refuses to stop soloing). What a performance.",

The \"bonus jam\" on Samson was supposedly the result of a broken microphone, and Jerry's series of same note staccato picks towards the end of the jam were supposedly directed towards the roadie working on the mike. When he stands up after the repair Jerry gives the super happy little guitar riff and then Weir yells Wooo! into the mike to see that it works. And away they go....",

Samson comes out swinging really swinging after a rough start. \n\nCheck out the cool progression that Jer plays around 6:40 in Scarlet - this is more like a stand alone '76 than it is a '78. The fore is really long and drippy No matter what this is a smoker - points off for the crummy quality of this. If this were a board I would say one of the best of the year for sure. \n\nChicago may be better than this other one for '78 but arnd 6:50 Jerry is just crushing it....\n\nLike the truckin>other no drums.... this is a great show.",

I usually think trilling on chords is a lazy thing on a guitar player's part- something they do while thinking of a new idea- and Garcia did rely on this at times, as do all others-but in this case the trilling goes through some convincing chord changes- very nice",

I have to admit that I was not a fan of Weir ditching his ringing Ibanez for the overt Strat sound sometime in the early 80's and this recording reminds me why.\nThe final Fire solo is bliss, like the whole song existed before it just to launch Jerry.\nWeir's freewheeling style is crystal clear here and complements the rest of the band the way I liked them.\n\nThe Other One.

Between the snow and the altitude made it very hard to find the car. Got up next morning and met Bob, Phil, Billy and Micky in the hotel resturant, and then when checking out met Jerry at the front desk . What a first time experience.

I recoded this show 5 rows back with a 1,000 dollar sony deck and 2 AKG mics. I then put on an Akai reel to reel and handed out as many cassettes of 2nd set as I could.
