I don't know how this happened but the tracking speed during the first set is waaaay fast and almost unlistenable.  Depending on how much time, skill and interest you have, it may be worth processing this set through an audio editing program to bring the pitch back to normal.  The 2nd set is perfect though, good AUD/SBD mix, great playing and normal pitch.  I'll give it 3 stars for a screwy first set and great 2nd set.",

Desolation Row, which was often plodding, lilts nimbly thanks to Jerry's fills, solo, and harmonies (\"where lovely mermaids flow\")\nBird Song sent me into another world at this show, and this recording confirms it escapes into the next realm.\nDidn't remember China Rider being so well executed, but the thunderous response at the usual moment (\"wish i was a headlight\") seems even more climactic than usual.\nThis recording doesn't pick up how Jerry slowed the acappella section of He's Gone by a half beat each time he repeated \"nothin gonna bring him back\", creating a really cool effect, but it does remind me how they just erupted out of that slow section into a great jam.",

Jerry was clearly bounced back since the coma and many shows: 3/26, 3/29, 4/4 were extremely tight with high energy.  The first night of Hartford is an excellent example, so I think warrants a full 5*, for sheer tightness.",

Every song has highlights. It's great to get to finally hear the second set, too - Looks Like Rain is just outstanding, and during one of the second set jams, I hear echoes of the amazing Birdsong Jam.  It has always felt like a soundboard to me, though a bit muddled in areas. Thanks so much for making this available.",

I had a great seat, first section off the floor on Phil's side, looking down at the band from the side of the stage, 20 rows up, and there were times that the crowd was as loud, if not louder than the band.
