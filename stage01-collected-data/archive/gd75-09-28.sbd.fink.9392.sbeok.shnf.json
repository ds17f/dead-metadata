Nice 6 minute Slipknot!, a very nice TLEO, and Jerry TEARS into the main lead break on Franklin's.  The sound is excellent, and if you listen real close, you'll hear someone playing harmonica on some of the songs (and pretty well, too - it's too bad it isn't louder in the mix.  Was that just some freak cranking up the harp in the front row, or is it just too quiet in the mix?)\nI give it 4, just because the American Music Hall show is superior, and the remastering they did on it is so great - it's hard to imagine listening to this show all that often...but it does have its share of gems, no doubt.",

To vadead and other archive.org fans:\n\nI've know Matthew Kelly for over 10 years now and have done several gigs (I'm a drummer) in Thailand with Kingfish and even one with Matthew and Bobby Weir in Jan 1996. Anyway, after reading your post I sent Matthew and email asking him if he played at this show. Here's his reply:\n\n\"As far as me having played harp with the Dead in 1975 in Golden Gate park,the time lines all seem to fit, but I have no recollection of it. However,I do believe that you definitely used the appropropriate term when you referred to the \"cobwebs of my mind\". Afterall, things were pretty hazy back then and there's a veritable plethera of gigs that people assure me that I have done, with pictures and tapes to prove their case of which I have absolutely no recollection whatsoever. So in answer to your question ,who knows??\n\"",

They're about as close to home base as they could be - Golden Gate Park, and boy do they deliver the goods! A fine, crisp SBD for the ears, and this may be the very first show where Jerry plays his new custom built Travis Bean guitar. The star of Set One is naturally the Help>Slipknot, played slowly but deliberately and they bring off the complex riffs with flying colors. The rest of Set One is average to good, with a reggae TLEO and a hot Big River the other standouts for me.\nThen Set Two shows that though they've been off the road for almost a year, they definitely haven't forgotten how to jam. Jerry really shines on the Truckin Jam, now with 2 drummers weaving texture into the groove. Keith's Fender Rhodes work is very tasty here as well. The Stronger Than Dirt Jam is amazingly fast, fluid and exciting all the way.The whole Set Two sounds easily as good as any 1977 show. If all the 1976 shows were this good, that year would be in competition with 1977 big time!\nThen they blow it out with a blazing version of NFA and GDTRFB where the whole band seems to be saying \"We're back folks!\" A little two disc wonder, short on long jams, but a real pearl nonetheless.\nDon't be cryin' if they release this one before you get it - get it now! Trip back 30 years to a time when Saturday Night Live was brand new, there was plenty of Dazed and Confused to go around, and an honest, intelligent peanut farmer was about to be President. Highly recommended and a rare classic!\nDr. flashback :-)",

The Franklin's is equally tepid and Jerry clearly isn't used to the song yet, both in words and music.\n\nThings do pick up with the post Truckin jam into GDTRFB but other than that and a fairly different sounding TLEO--sort of halfway between the early fast version and later slower versions, this show is nothing to get excited about.\n\nSorry, but i'm calling this one like I hear it.",

This show was performed at Golden Gate Park about 5 weeks later, it has a similar feel. It's kinda the sister show to \"One from the Vault\" show.

While Phil's base twinges might smell of The Eleven and Jerry's progesssions also might beat around the bush, we never get an official confirmation. Infact, I dont nesssesarily think that they even inteded it, just a misleading label.\n\nBut it does make sense for 75 considering this was their \"hiadous\" year, playing only few and far between as opposed to every waking moment of the year. This leaves room for some non-traditional bust outs (King Solomans) but I can't buy that the \"Truckin'\" jam is an \"Eleven Jam\", just because it would insult the original versions which were flowing with excitement, acidic fluidity, and tight group formation. This jam is too loose and jazzy to be considered that.\n\nRest of the setlist is good, but like others have been saying, refer to One From The Vault for a better example from this time period. Yeah, also a sick TLEO, transending the old versions to a newer, slower, reggae thang, kinda of like Good Lovin' from 1976-12-31 at Cow Palace.

To this 77 fan, the worst show from May of that year is better than anything from, say, a half decade of the late 80s. That being said, 09/28/75 sounds like a live concert as opposed to the tentative, studio-like feel to the GAMH show.\n\nAs for sound quality, after reading H. Seamon's comparison of the Fink and Ashley versions for use in his Matrix, I gave a serious listen to both. Contrary to my expectations, the Fink version has some real advantages--channel separation being the most obvious. (J. Ashley, I still humbly bow to you and your amazing work.) It's a matter of personal taste, but to any serious collector, I recommend listening to this version.\n\n...__[8]o",

The band is obviously having a ball and playing their collective ass off. This is one of a kind from a special point in GD history- the \"vacation\". Such an interesting stylistic edge to this performance - nothing like the '74 marathons and nothing like the '76 lighter mellower Dead (which I loved also). I remember missing the band in '74 thus having to wait an extra year 'til '76 to catch 'em again when  I first acquired this tape. As i said its been on my shelf for ages - glad I checked it out again - wholeheartedly agree with whomever said - turn this one on and CRANK IT!",

Tonally quite dissimilar from the other offerings of a very strange year (1975). Contrast with the Great American Music Hall classic, which to my ears\ncomes across as a more sophisticated, challenging\neffort while retaining that  endearing \"chunk-a-chunk\" quality unique to the period (sorry, that's the best way I can describe it).\n  I'm certainly not complaining, but the quality\nof the recording seems to vary over time, while\nnever being near unacceptably low. Still, on GDTRFB in particular and in other stretches, doesn't it sound like they're playing through\nreally cheap or borrowed equipment?

I'd been out most of the previous night, didn't even hear the Dead rumors until Marty Balin announced it from stage.\n\nChilly day, but a great show. I will clarify, for those still wondering, that it was indeed Matthew Kelly on harmonica. I recognized him right away because Kingfish had been busy at the time and I was at several of their shows.\n\nFor a 19-year-old Deadhead who'd arrived in town just a month earlier, to actually be there for a free show in Golden Gate Park was indescribable.

This show has elements of both, yet is quite unique in its own right.  I can't think of another show that compares real closely to this one in terms of style.

Lucky me. I had a place to stay, some excellent people to show me the sights of the great city and a concert to look forward to.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the Dead, but they did put on a pretty good show and the experience of mingling with the crowd and the very uniqueness of it all made it one of those peak life moments.

      "review_text": "True hiatus <br />Last show for over 8mos. Last show of four in '75. First time they played with Jefferson Starship in 5 years. Second of only two times in '75 billed as Grateful Dead. First public show introduced as Grateful Dead in almost a year. The Haight-Ashbury People's Ballroom put on a series of free shows - this one was Unity Fair '75, and they had successfully booked Jefferson Starship. Kantner then asked Jer to open for them at short notice, and said he was surprised when Jer said yes (possibly because the new album had just reached stores - without touring plans). The Dead were not announced in advance, and the show was promoted as Starship & Friends. All low-key, you were unlikely to hear about it if you did not live in the Bay Area or even on the peninsula. Still, the crowd size was estimated at 20k-40k.  Weir had joked to friends that \"San Francisco was about to hear the rustiest band in show business\" and that \"the audience would probably end up holding torches and pitchforks\", a comment that fit the first two shows of the year but not the recent one. By the set's end, however, he was described as euphoric (albeit most of the band supposedly  got dosed, which hadn't happened in years). Jer played Wolf earlier in the day with Diga Rhythm Band, but played his Travis Bean with the Dead. There are <a href=\"https://www.gdao.org/solr-search?q=38_s:%22Lindley%20Meadow,%20Golden%20Gate%20Park%20%5C-%20September%2028,%201975%22&facet=itemtype%3A%22Image%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">lots of pics</a>. The Dead played 40-50 free shows - chiefly '66-'70, not counting benefits - but this was the last (they played a set as part of the Graham memorial in the park, in '91). All four '75 shows [two as Garcia & Friends] were free shows or benefits<b>:</b> 3/23 was ostensibly a benefit, 6/17 was a memorial & benefit, 8/13 was an an industry showcase, and this date was a free park show (an Aug 22 show as Grateful Dead had been cancelled).  \n\nThey played one set @1hr45mins. Opener <i>Help on the Way</i> is the third one, but just the second with lyrics. Jer forgets a verse but it's warm, cozy and great. <i>Slipknot!</i> is the third one but the first not going into a Franks - they call a halt when Jer breaks a string, and he's absent on the closing riffs. Franks is picked up later (in the next year they do a Slipknot! into an NFA and one into a Samson). Matt Kelly then comes out to blow the next bunch (only heard here and there). <i>Music Never Stopped</i> is the second ever. Donna is good but they are slightly unsure. An anomaly on the official @3:30 could have been easily fixed. This is the first <i>They Love Each Other</i> in over 1\u00bdyrs and the first without the bridge section. It has a unique sound but is mostly of historical interest. A standard <i>Beat it On Down the Line</i>-10 leads to the third ever <i>Franklin's Tower</i>. Jer impersonates Travis Lion Bean, but it's not as great as the previous show. <i>Big River</i> IS  reminiscent of that show. Keith is great and Kelly is heard. <i>Musta Been Roses</i> is rote & bland (this premieres the new arrangement, with an end solo), and they get lost a few times in a mess of a <i>Truckin'</i>. Like the SBD, the OFF has a 35sec edit @3:18, cutting the \"Sittin' and starin'/Busted\" verses (3:11>3:46 on beggs AUD or 2:46>3:21 on menke AUD, though both are missing a few secs @3:46/3:21, oddly both slightly different sections). The Truckin' jam has been mistakenly called \"The Eleven\" or \"Eleven Jam\" on some lists/tapes (even the OFF!). They drop one beat and briefly go into 11/8 time (@3:20 before Drums, for 1\u00bdmins), but do not visit the riff from The Eleven. This happened a lot in passing, though longer examples are the Day at the Dentist Space, in the 26Dec81 Oakland show (a jam in true 11/8 time, but not the The Eleven riffs), and on 6Aug82 St. Paul, using TOO riffs. The final The Eleven was 4/26/70. <i>King Solomon's Marbles</i> was correctly labeled on <b>One from the Vault</b> so it's strange that it's labeled Stronger than Dirt on <b>30 Trips</b> (as on many tapes and here). Original labels on <b>Blues for Allah</b> correctly listed \"KSM>Stronger than Dirt (or Milkin' the Turkey)\", but  confusion was caused when later CDs incorrectly listed KSM as having \"pt. 1 StD and pt. 2 MtT\". The correct list on this show is Truckin'>Drums>King Solomon's Marbles>StDoMtT>King Solomon's>NFA. Even the original studio version actually goes back into Phil's KSM, but at this show they skipped the later parts of Blues for Allah (unlike the previous two shows), and unfortunately after this all were abandoned. This is the 4th KSM and the second StDoMtT [the latter starts @2:06 on track 12; @2:13 on Menke]; the fullest KSM and the last. The next couple songs are not fully inspired/exciting, but there's a slick finish with <i>Saturday Night</i>, if Bobby is getting a bit fried. <i>Goin' Down the Road</i> has a cut @0:31 of 39 secs [missing 0:30>1:09 of the AUD], but the OFF and SBD edit this slightly differently.\n\nOverall = B- \u00a0\u00a03\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nHelp on the Way - warm and cozy\nBig River - Keith good and a bit of Kelly blowing harp\nKing Solomon's Marbles - fullest version\nOne More Saturday Night - making a statement to launch true hiatus\n\nSOURCES: Bob Menke captured an AUD (motb-0069_91769) so pristine that it is often labeled a SBD. It is patched with the SBD and is the only source with the full tunings (which the OFF does not have). It has a cut in Truckin' @3:20 of several secs, that's smoothed over on unknown_.2562 (or  beggs_236), which oddly is only missing a few secs. These latter two are the Menke AUD, but are missing TLEO and do not patch the cuts [3\u00bd mins of Truckin', NFA @0:26 of 18secs, GDtRFB @6:53 of 8secs]. The true SBD is fink_9392. It is missing the Phil intro, but has all songs except the complete Truckin' and GdtrFB, which are the edited sources (as on bertha-ashley_22257, an EQd SBD). <b>30 Trips</b> has most of the show, uses the edits that were made by someone on the original SBD, and trims tunings/banter. The 102155 is a strong Seamons matrix. Franklin's is on <b>Definitive Live Story</b>.",
