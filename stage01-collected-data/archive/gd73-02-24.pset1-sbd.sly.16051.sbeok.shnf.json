A magical show followed on 5/13/73 in Des Moines at the fairgrounds. But this night the fieldhouse was packed. The band was on. I had taken the bus to Champaign and saw the show 2 nights earlier. These shows show why '73 is my favorite year. Yes hopeully some day the rest of the show is found. You never know. As the recent finding of a couple of shows in '69 and '70 shows, it can happen. GO HAWKS!!",

      "review_text": "What a tease <br />A very poor-qual AUD used to circulate that went:<br /><b>x1x</b> Bertha; Mexicali Blues; Brown Eyed Women; Looks Like Rain; Loose Lucy; Beat it on Down the Line; China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider; Jack Straw; Here Comes Sunshine; El Paso; Box of Rain; Tennessee Jed; Playing in the Band\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br /><b>x2x</b> They Love Each Other; Greatest Story Ever Told; Row Jimmy; Big River; Ramble on Rose; Me & Bobby McGee; Wave That Flag; You Ain't Woman Enough; Truckin'>Eyes of the World>Sugar Magnolia.<br />\nApparently there was no encore. The show became more of a mystery after a Phil jam became the most common fragment. It was assumed that it was part of a Truckin'>Nobody's Fault Jam, until Nov. 2012 when the continuation into Sugar Mag was part of 30 Days of Dead, and we figured out it was coming out of Eyes. Anyway, it's not a NFJ: four descending major chords means a Feelin' Groovy (starts @5:54), whereas NFJ (played earlier, in a Truckin' sequence) is a blues jam in minor key. <a href=\"http://deadessays.blogspot.com\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\">Light Into Ashes</a> points out that this was the last random Feelin' Groovy Jam before it became part of China>Rider.\n\nIt's a total tease because it's a pretty interesting frag and, given the setlist, it may have been a stellar, 4-hour show (there are four jam songs in the 1st set alone). Or not. There are supposed to be remaining mysteries, and anyway it's <i>Iowa</i> (note how one person's parents went, were blown away and yet <i>never went to another show</i>!), so we can't expect many tapers. The Alembic system with which they were touring (this is the year before the Wall of Sound toured) assigned Phil's bass one channel per string, and it sounds like the mix at the board split these into left and right channels (in the 2nd set frag). That does not necessarily mean this is what the audience heard from the stacks this night (with the quirks of that year's system) but it's possible, given pictures of  the '73 stage setup. If it was used that night, it probably wasn't as distinct in person as it would be on a SBD.\n\nSOURCES: The sly_16051 for the end of the 1st Set. The Dead.net release of Eyes Jam>Sugar Magnolia. UPDATE: The owen_berger AUD mono frag, in better quality (needs +1% pitch), adds Wave That Flag, Truckin' and Eyes, so we now have a clearer indication of a great lost show.  As a show frag it now totals 84min of B+ to B- from the 1st set (with a great Playin') and the must-hear 2nd set Eyes jam into Sugar Mag (SBD) plus the 2nd set AUD of Wave That Flag>Truckin'>Eyes first half (A to A-).\nOverall = 4\u00bd Stars (extant, collective frags)",
