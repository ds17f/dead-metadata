They tacked this show on to the tour no gd ticket sales, which is why I was able to go. Fun Chicago show, the Rosemont was not my favorite venue, with the planes and all. They did have speakers in the hallways though. Louie, Louie was ok nothing like Louisville 04-09-89. Typical Dead show for that era, the Hey Jude brought the house down and Heaven's Door was a sweet way to send us out to face the Rosemont cops who were not my favorite either.

      "review_text": "First Show This was my very first Dead show. We lived three hours south of Chi-town and I was home on Spring break.  My friends talked me into going up there without tickets.  We dropped before we left and by the time we hit Chicagos traffic we were flippin-not even imagining what was yet to come.  We scalped some tickets and were so high we didn't even really look at them.  By this time we had dropped again and eaten about 2 grams of mushrooms too.  We were pleasantly suprised when the ushers kept telling us to go down further.  We had scored 8th row tickets.  WOW what an experience that was and I immediately decided I wanted to see these guys as many times as I could.  It changed my view on live music totally and I can't express enough how grateful I am to have witnessed these  guys turn it on as many times as I did.  Once again thanks for the memories and the lifestyle I lead today.",

The cops in Bloomington, Indiana were very cool to us, and just called a tow truck to unflip the VW out of the intersection, then let us go sympathecticly, freak flag and all.  two of the guys were going to a film convention in Chicago, and hitched a ride.  The show was packed, and roudy!  I remember grabbing a bunch of old cups and stuff out of the garbage in the show to act like my hands were full, because the ushers were not checking tickets for folks with hands of food.  it worked and we got up front. what a jam.  the ride home was smoother.",

      "review_text": "Nothing too distinct 1st Set: When's the last time the band opened with a \"Scarlet\" much less a \"Scarlet->Fire\" combo? Regardless, the former is tepid lacking any jamming while the latter has clear Jerry lines but the excavation is not all that deep. \"Walkin\" is airy and not compelling enough. \"Cnadyman\" features some wavering, nausea tones that fit the theme of the song. When will they retire \"Louie Louie?\" a failed attempt at a mid-set blues mood number? At the very least, the boys sound good when they say 'we gotta go.' Smart thinking seguing this with such a pooular skiffle of a riff that charms all who come down to \"Cumberland.\" \"Memphis Blues\" is fine but the \"Deal\" goes from breezy uptempo nonchalance to a fitting busy end to this first set.\n\n2nd Set: \"Hell\" is nothing better than standard, despite action artifically (synth cheats) picking up during the last minute. \"Crazy\" feels stilted as a song but when Jerry takes over during the quiet coda, his singular instrument is comforting to those in solace. \"LLR\" is also reassuringly soft and small. Even Bobby is repressing himself. \"Terrapin\" is a tight if not monumental machine. A deer's hooves are providing trott-y noises during \"Drums.\" \"Space\" is relatively disorienting whereas \"TOO\" is compactly busy. Oddly, we then are treated to a nonchalant, purposeless but fine enough \"Miracle.\" The \"Fantasy/Hey Jude Reprise\" is becoming a staple at 1988 Dead shows though tonight's edition lacks a 'fresh' seal of approval. A wave of \"Lovelite\" hits the stage. Jerry's countering Bobby's words well thoughout. Mild bustle. \n\n\"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen...tonight is a very special night because it's one of our drummers' birthdays. In fact, in fact, it's both of our drummers' birthdays. So you can throw stuff out, at them...\" No singing this time around except by Jerry who's in a different, more somber mood, a soulful \"Knockin.\"\n\n3 stars",

      "review_text": "Stream this already! I just listened to this show and I have to say that I loved the audio, wherever it came from. I have a lot to say about it too! If you fully believe the Dead were the only live band, you might not want to read further below, because some of the stuff I might say may strike the remaining faithful as blasphemy. \n\nI was at this stand of shows too and I've always been a bit torn as to which one was the best, first on the 13th, Or this one on the 15th. As Dstone5553 posted earlier, \"Doesn't hold a candle to the first night's second set but still worthy. \" He isn't far off the mark, set 2 of Wednesday was rambunctious, Though the lackluster, clock punching set 1 really detracts from my overall memories of that show.  Frankly, I've always thought that the inspired playing in the second set on the 13th is a result of how flat the first set fell. \n\nAs for the gem on the Fifteenth. . .The first set with the Scarlet/Fire opener was certainly a surprise, maybe not as stretched out as some second set run throughs, but a real rarity nonetheless. Another reviewer posits that it was the only one ever. I'm not sure of that. If so, on rarity merit alone this show should rate with all the set list score keeping GD fans. If you ever went to see this band let it all hang out and take chances even in their advanced age, set one of the 15th is one that clearly highlights a band not just resting on their laurels. \n\nTo clarify we're talking about the same show, this show was definitely at Rosemont. The band did three nights at UIC Pavillion the year before. CBR must be awesome!\n\nAnother reviewer below, jboyaquar, indicates, \" Oddly, we then are treated to a nonchalant, purposeless but fine enough \"Miracle.\" The \"Fantasy/Hey Jude Reprise\" is becoming a staple at 1988 Dead shows though tonight's edition lacks a 'fresh' seal of approval.\"  \n\nI'd argue that there are many shows of post-coma Jerry that are far better than a great deal of the early 80's shows. Any number of which Jerry was seen sporting his latest fashion accessory onstage, a shower cap that  kept  his hair from catching fire while freebasing between sets. \n\nAlso, I'm going to digress into a bit of music trivia/history. Grace Slick has claimed that one of her greatest memories of Woodstock is being in the bar used by all the musicians as a hang out/staging area. The jukebox in this bar had the recently released Beatles Single, Hey Jude, on the jukebox. She claimed that it was played over and over with everyone singing along. If some of the greatest musical artists of the past half century found Hey Jude good enough to sing along to over and over, I'll sing along with this staple any time. Even if it lacks jboyaquar's fresh seal of approval. In reality, the Dear Mr Fantasy/Hey Jude reprise is a far less disingenuous tune reading than \"the Weight\" which was favored after Brett's passing. \n\nNot to say that GD enterprises wasn't always a business, but the earlier years feel a lot more communal and a lot less greedy. But prior to the band realizing their full corporate potential, they were having some inspired performances with the band seeming to enjoy themselves with the recently clean Jerry and a new lease on life. I'd posit that they all realized, to steal a line from Almost Famous, that they got a second chance to run off and join the circus. This is because the goose that laid the golden egg, Jerry, didn't pass on at that point. \n\nIf there is a disappointment with it, it is in the breaks inserted at points to demarcate the tracks. In the aforementioned Fantasy/Hey Jude, before Jerry kicks in (and just before the track break) you can hear Brett singing na, na, na. . . off mic. Is this Brett giving a heads up to the rest of the band that he wanted to do the hey jude reprise at the end of fantasy?  That's my take on it. It also says to me that maybe Hey Jude isn't as rote as others might have you believe. If this were the case, it would seem to me that it would have appeared tacked on the end of the \"without a net\" live album.  \n\nAnother  example of this less than convenient track break bummer for me is at the other one/miracle break. At the time, I felt that Jerry was holding that note at the end of the other one until the rest of the band caught up and miracle kicked in. It just seemed to hang there and then ca-chunk-chunk, Miracle was off and running. \n\nLast bit of remniscing about the show: In the knockin encore, in one of the latter choruses, that is Jerry with the wail. At this very point in the show, he also raised his fist in a bit of triumph to go with it. I'd always thought that this gesture and yelp(?) was a sign that he himself believed that the band was firing on all cylinders this very evening, including his voice. And if it is as I believe, and the one person who was pretty much the Grateful Dead incarnate felt the same way, That is even more reason to give this show some props. Really, there is some 80s era output that deserves a bit more credit than it receives.\n\nThe las bit of bummer track break complaining, I wish the start of the second set had a bit of the crowd before the band kicks into Hell in a Bucket, I've always been fond of that bit of anticipation guessing game.  But overall it brought back great memories and I'm more than happy it is out there for others to hear. If reading all this doesn't do it for you, put the show on and hear for yourself.",

I was at this show, 10th row center, off to Jerry's side. Epic. The Knockin' was incredible.

      "review_text": "Best?? Ok, I'll stand in the face of the purists and declare this the best dead show of all time. Sure, I would have liked to have been there in the 70's with the crowd helping, but this was the late eighties and the only thing that was available, was a crowd half filled with In The Dark radio fans and the echoes of the soundstage that was the Rosemont Horizon.\nThey ALL showed up on this night, and the first thing I remember is Jerry playing the scarlet solo backwards/inverted after being shown some tasty riffs. I didn't have long to ponder this impossibility before Fire started in and the band introduced themselves with Brents electrical magical piano that would permeate this show. Jerry, everpresent, had some extra pop in the pedal, and the drums and base made their presence known between riffs. Walkin was testing the aforementioned echoes to their absolute heights and then they went to Candyman and it was clear the foreshadowing was no mistake. We were going for a ride. My favorite version of all time since space and time were actually being distorted, I can attest.Sweet electric solo, then it was on to Louie. Say goodbye to reality, this is your last glimpse for a while. Cumberland, you can hear the crowd swoon after the first verse when they BENT the song, and I admit I became a little lost, in Mobile maybe? Eternity passed since I'm here to describe deal with Brent carrying the otherwise tame version until the end when they all came together to finish off the set... WTF just happened?\nThe second set is exponentially better with Miracle, being the only song, out of place. I will tell you that we NEEDED the miracle and the band killed it once the effect of the past wore off a bit.Personally, I think even they thought they carried it too far.\nI can amend my first statement to my favorite dead show even though, judging by the crowds reactions, everyone who saw this show went though a special spatial, mind altering revival. I have more personal favorites associated with this show but all but Candyman are in the second set so you'll have to listen to judge for yourself. It's taken 25 years, but I have found what I've lost. This show. Enjoy!",

      "review_text": "Rosemont 88 Finale, n3 Best show of the run. I think this show and run from spring '88 sees the band inching closer to that refined '89/'90 sound. At any rate, they certainly sound better than they did the previous spring of '87- not that they sounded bad. Those shows were exciting as sort of comeback shows, but the band just sounds both tighter and more relaxed for these. Of course, it's been noted how great su88 was: \"Summer of 1988 is often hailed as one of the best touring periods for the Grateful Dead. The mid-June to early-July shows...have always been nodded to as release-worthy outings.\" Read more: http://jerrygarcia.com/tour/summer-1988/11362. \n\nLove this Scarlet-Fire show opener. You know it's gonna be hot when they open like this. I can't recall -- off hand -- any time they've done this before or since. Walkin' blues and Candyman that follows are very good versions. Make sure to check out the Candyman jam. Louie Louie is rollicking, not the most polished but certainly good fun and segues into Cumberland. Memphis->Deal to close. Deal closer always hits the spot! \n\nFor a change, I think the real goods comes in the third quarter rather than the fourth. But don't slouch on the fourth, post-drums/space is also great. Seamless transition to Miracle after a five minute heater of an Other One. No late Jerry ballad, but it fine: there's a great Mr. Fantasy/Hey Jude->Lovelight closer and then there's a beautiful rendition of Heaven's Door. ",
