Why the need to insult people?  Why the sanctimoniousness? \n\nNot everyone worships at the same altar as you.  Please spare us the trotting out of the old sacred cow that no performance outside of  '68 through '74 (or wherever you put the bookends) can ever be considered as good as one inside of those dates.  \n\nTake a piece of music like the Stranger from 7-17-89.  Jerry's solo is jazz, and it is masterful.  He hints at an idea, then goes off to pursue another related but clearly distinct musical idea, then returns to the original riff and nails it home.  It is nothing like a scorching Viola Lee solo from '68 or a mind-melting '72 Dark Star, but it is no less good.  \n\nIf you don't think that the '80s have some great playing by Jerry, some of it up there with his best, even if different, I feel sorry for you.  Perhaps you need to expand your listening mind.\n\nThis show has some great playing.  Maybe not Earth-shattering, as Dead shows go, nonetheless a great band in great form.",

It's my guess that the negative reaction to his comments stem from INEXPERIENCE. I saw them 175 or 180 times, yes, but the best part of my GD experience is that I saw them almost every year over a 25 year period (5-15-70, Kirkwood Community College through the St. Louis shows before the final Chicago shows). Those of you who are criticizing him, did you see a bunch (about 85 or 90 for me) of shows between '70 and '78 or '79? I'm here to tell you that if you had, you'd know FROM EXPERIENCE that after that the boys never really played the same way that gave them their reputation. Did they play great shows after '79? Sure, on occasion, but never were they the force that they were in earlier years. It's not being bitter, people, it's reality. Thanks for letting me share, BW",

      "review_text": "A fine show for the era I personally prefer to write and read reviews that are in the context of the era, but that's just me. This is a fine show from a very fine tour for the early-80s incarnation of the greatest band on earth.\n\nNow, as for the debate on this page, both sides are half right and half wrong, I think. I certainly agree that the best years of Grateful Dead music are from the 60s and 70s, and even though I was too young to see them then (my first was in high school, in 1985) I'm well aware that in the early years there was a personal, musical and psychedelic intensity that goes beyond what we experienced later. So in that sense the crotchety old guy is right. \n\nWhere he's wrong is that he came off like a condescending jerk while doing it. It's not just what you say, but how you say it.\n\nThere's a significant subjective component to music appreciation, and also a very real objective one. I can't understand people who say that the early 80s are just as good as the early 70s (or better, as a few even claim), and in many cases there are objective reasons to say they're wrong...some of it depends on what you like...but all of this nonsense could be avoided if people would just learn to talk about \"my favorite\" or \"I prefer this over that\" instead of just saying What It Is.\n\nNone of us are qualified to do that. If you don't get that everyone's POV on the Dead is valid on some level, I can guarantee that you're completely missing the point, because this is something Garcia himself hammered over and over in interviews.\n\nBottom line - if you like this era of Dead you'll probably like this show, and if not, not. If you don't know, check it out, it's an above average representation of the period and a fine example of the style of the time.\n\nEnjoy, and peace",

So, as such without Day Job how could any show be good. As such all shows after 1989 and before 1986 were garbage, since their only good song is day job. Oh well. I would never want to see a show with some thing like here comes sunshine or a real darkstar versus the bird songy thing on 7/13/84.2/13/70 must have been a drag, but the best show ever was actually at Woodstock. The vocals were excellent, and the high time is better than 11/7/85. So old man, youve been trumped. Instead of seeing them at a small venue with 200 people, join us with 800,000 and see the band from 3 miles away in section 840 at Giants Stadium in New Jersey of all places without Pigpen, Donna, Keith, or jerry, and wait for a estimated to prove something that can't yet be proven. I promise you will never want to see them again. Now back to that 6/30/74 thing, wish they would play springfield this year, whomever they are. Bob etc. and someone.",

      "review_text": "Love is love, not fade away Music is personal.  Some love it all.  Some love jazz.  Some love classical.  Some love rock.  I love it all unless it denegrates women or glorifies violence.  But I especially love the Grateful Dead.  I even find flashes of brilliance in 1995 when a sick and dying Jerry was giving us all he had to give.  Even at their worst--and there were some awful shows over the  decades-- there was nothing like a Grateful Dead concert!  Love and kinship abounded.  So let's remember our commonalities and love of America's greatest band.  #BeKind  #AINTNOTIMETOHATE \n\nAs for this show, a highlight from summer of 1982.  Along with Iowa City, my favorite from the 6 shows I caught that summer.  \n\nOh to be 23 again, still in grad school, and having the luxury of time and lack of real world responsibilities.  Able to hop in the car and catch a few shows around this fantabulous country.  \n\nSo whether you think this is the best show ever, or a dog, or just a good show for the era, be grateful it happened at all.  Just like life, nothing is certain.  So appreciate life and all it has given you.  Especially the opportunity to have experienced the Grateful Dead.  Lord knows my life is better for having gone to shows from 74 to 95 and beyond.  A lifetime of great friends and wondrous memories.  And as 60,000 of us chanted leaving Soldier Field after the 3rd Fare Thee Well show......   love is love, NOT FADE AWAY!",

Tape wear and stretches, and 30+ years of age from original recording night, all considered.\nI don't hear the \"cut\" in Stella others say is there. Sounds great while I type this. All around solid playing from the band, and I would have left feeling I got my money's worth at the end.\nAgain, all the thanks to Charlie for being so kind to bring this recording for us all to enjoy. It's the 08-03 #DeadOnThisDate pick on twitter.",

First set is very strong.  To Lay Me Down was exquisite, and another 2nd set LIG very tasty.  Almost at Stella Blue, which others note is wonderful - can\u2019t wait!\n\nAnd to the grumpy old timer below, just chill.   Some people only saw the beginning in the 60s, others the 70s, 80s or even the 90s.  Many crossed decades.  But every decade had its ups and downs (albeit more downs as time wore on.). But one thing holds true: When they were \u201con\u201d it was \u201con\u201d for sure, a musical and social event with no rivals. My heavy time was 1980-1989 and I am blessed for being at some truly incredible shows that I would rack up there with some of the best.  True, I had to wade through some clunkers, but that just made the great ones that much sweeter.",

      "review_text": "8/3/82 Is The Magic Given one show to be allowed to return to, this is the one (out of 121 shows coast to coast from 1/79 thru the end).  Still the best Half Step and the best Franklin's I've heard.  Big Railroad also sounded so good from my seat  (I had a Row H center reserved seat-sweet spot).  I remember the sparkling light reflections off of the scrollwork on Bob's fancy red Ibanez guitar during the Franklin's and his jaw muscles twitching and grinding uncontrollably during his slide guitar break in Minglewood.  Poor guy.  Too much coffee before the show I suppose.  During the 2nd set Let It Grow jamming a guy next to me dancing on his chair lost his balance and fell and everyone grabbed him before he hit the deck. The sound was just incredible at my seat and they were playing songs where I kept thinking \"Oh, I love this song.\"  So many favorites played at this one. It was the only show where I came out and told people \"I think I got off on the first set more than the second.\" Small outdoor ampitheatre with no roof on a gorgeous summer night in 1982 under a full moon with the Grateful Dead sparkling on stage.  A perfect show experience. We spent the night camping at some nearby campground with a lake and jumping off of a dock and swimming and playing in the water all night long under the full moon.  The plan was to drive back to home base at Rolla, MO. after the show but while on the highway to KC my friends (from KMNR, we were all college radio station DJs) announced that they decided to camp out instead.  All I had was the clothes I was wearing.  Cutoffs, tee shirt, sandles. Napped on a picnic table towards sunrise wrapped in a pair of extra jeans someone had.  This really should be an official GD release.  My fav 1982 show. The Audience tape enjoyed by so many for so long sounds better than the SBD.  10 1982 stars for this one.",

      "review_text": "I was 24 and will never forget this show This August will celebrate the 40 year anniversary of this remarkable concert.  I was living in KC at the time and the Starlight theater had a package program where you could buy a group of concerts before the season started and was guaranteed your seats would be in the first three rows.  They offered several packages with different groups and I chose the one that included Van Halen, Doobie Brothers (with Michael McDonald), Asia (ex Yes members and other players) and THE GRATEFUL DEAD!!!   What a f\u2019in no brainer.  Well my previous experiences with seeing the Dead live was about 6 years and maybe 10 shows.  After that night, I went full throttle.  This was also the first show that I later got a copy of my first bootleg tape, which took me to a new level of obsession.  I would have to argue that most \u201cwhite collar dead heads\u201d got that way from falling in love with GD bootleg tapes.  Well to get to my review.  This has been and always will be my favorite.  That first note Jerry hits towards the end of Mississippi Half that begins the transition into Franklins Tower just was perfect.  He then begins a wonderful solo ballad where every note was coming from his musically gifted perfect mind.   Hanging on some notes, then floating around in and out and out and in until it was time to start the shift towards Franklin Tower.   Amazing Jerry moment and as always, Phil was following along in perfect sync.  What surprises me is how  few people have commented on the Peggy-O song.  Holy Cow that in my mind is the best part of the concert.  Cumberland Blues and Althea and then the best Big RR Blues EVER!!!   Period.  Jerry was ripping the shit out of that song.  The back and forth duo solo between Jerry and Brent in Shake Down is priceless.  You could tell that Brent threw in the flag towards the end of that moment and gave the trophy to Jerry.  Sorry Brent, you held your own very nicely but that would sort of be similar to playing chess with Magnus.  It was fun at first, but it was time to knock your king over.  The only bad issue about the concert is I can\u2019t find a copy of the show with the brilliant crystal clear audience taping.  The sound is a little muffled and we aren\u2019t getting the great high notes and the deep Phil notes that rattle your rib cage.  I would be so grateful (no pun intended) if anyone out there had a version with that quality.  Miss you Jerry.   But thank you for all these shows on this forum. RIP",

Some because I was there, or to mark them so i can keep track of which ones i've listened to, want to find my way back to etc.\n\nAnd then there is the occasional show that while casually listening to, you go \"Oh my god.\" This show is one where I hit the Favorite button because its genuinely a standout being a smoking show, and one that deserves the recognition. \n\nI also have been skimming over the names of so many venues they played over the decades that without attending, or being near to it, you would never think twice about the contribution the venue gave the show. Ive heard of the Starlight theater but just thought it was a theater, like the capital, the orpheum, or whatever. I was pretty amazed when I saw photos of this place. Very cool.",

      "review_text": "I'm going to Kansas City <br />An outdoor show at the attractive Starlight, known for (and traded because of) a great Shakedown. It also has one of the better second sets from the year. This was their first time at the amphitheater, and though there are more consistent shows overall from this tour (say, 7/29), and better shows later in '82, there are a few don't-miss highlights here. The 1st set has a flat Bobby and a trainwrecking Jer, with short bursts of GOGD, but the 4-song pre-Drums sequence in the 2nd set is money.\n\nFirst Set. The SBD is poor quality for the first couple songs; you'll do better with an AUD. The FOH mix was poor for <i>Half-Step Mississippi</i> and Jer is cold so it's kind of a wash. But they do warm up<b>:</b> <i>Franklin's</i> is not an all-timer, but it's fun. <i>Minglewood</i>, however, outright sizzles (KC fillies/Kansas City). <i>Peggy-O</i> is solid and Jer keeps taking measures [the SBD speeds &amp; slows here]. After a perfunctory <i>El Paso, Cumberland</i> surprises with alacrity. The rest is average to below average. <i>Althea</i> is a sludgefest with no big solos and <i>Cassidy</i> is a borderline clunker, though <i>Big Railroad</i> perks halfway. A raggedy <i>Might as Well</i> signals the break.\n\nSecond Set. As they tune, somebody shouts a request for \"Mars Hotel\", perhaps from an alternate universe where that's the band's best set opener. <i>Shakedown</i> soon hits X factor, then delivers a gobsmacking jam. Great version, Brent in particular. Likewise the <i>Samson</i>, which builds spires on top of that granitic base. Jer knows he's on top of a good one so he extends <i>To Lay Me Down</i> [it's longer than 12/14/90]. <i>Let it Grow</i> is led by Jer with concentrated intent, plus check out what Bobby does after Jer/Phil leave [the very beginning is cut on SBDs; use 136587_senn441 here]. <i>He's Gone</i> is tight, if sans fireworks, but they make up for it on a slick <i>Other One</i>. Here the SBD abruptly speeds, needing -1.5% pitch correction from  6:03&gt;6:19. The sweet <i>Stella</i> needs -1.5% from  8:08&gt;end. The rest of the set is average, but with a fluctuating SBD. <i>Sugar Magnolia</i> needs -1.5%  from 0:00&gt;3:30; -2% 3:30&gt;4:50; -1% 4:50&gt;5:20. <i>Casey Jones</i> needs -1% from 0:00&gt;2:57 &amp; 3:40&gt;end. This was the last CJ for nearly two years.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B\nOverall = 3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nNew Minglewood Blues \u2013 sizzles like a KC Strip cut  \nShakedown Street \u2013 delivers awesome jam, listen to each player\nSamson &amp; Delilah \u2013 floats on Shakedown's angel's share, builds\nLet it Grow \u2013 w/concentrated intent\nThe Other One \u2013 twirls, swings back, forth\n\nSOURCES: All sources have mix, pitch &amp; EQ issues. AUDs surpass the SBD in places. The clearest AUD is the 145217_fob_beyer. It has the beginning notes of Half-Step Mississippi that are missing from (even the patched) SBDs, as well as a couple solos that are turned down/off on SBDs. It runs a bit fast in places. The tetzeli_fix-19228_33614 runs from slightly fast to way too fast. The partial_121973 runs too slow. The 158506_senn421_vita has extreme pitch errors, running from 1%&gt;3% too fast in the 1st set, and 3%&gt;4% too slow in the 2nd set. All SBDs have pitch issues, running too fast, and have below avg sound qual [no lows, hissing highs, some buzzing], improving marginally for the second set. The miller_77196 has the best sound quality, though you need to re-pitch and EQ [try lifting 70&gt;180hz shelved; dropping a notch @600hz, rising considerably from there to 6k and shelved across the rest of the highs]. It <u>needs -2% pitch correction</u> for the first 30secs of Half-Step, <u>then -1.5% for</u> the rest of the first two songs. Minglewood <u>needs -1%</u> along with the first 29secs of Peggy-O and all of Cumberland. The first few secs of Big Railroad <u>need -2%</u>. The second half of the second set has wonky pitch errors, as outlined above. The sbd_unk_19228 has similar pitch errors but lesser sound qual. Or, you can try the chappell_30705 MTX, which <u>needs -1.5% correction</u> for the first set and <u>-1% for the</u> second set. It doesn't really sound that different from the [best] SBD.",

Still excellent it hits all the key points with Bremt adding a great sound of his own alongside Jerry's tight solos and Phil dropping bombs like he's liberating France in 1944.\n\nAny show that involves TOO>Stella in the 80s is a mark of a good performance. Which get rare until 89>90 when Jerry is apparently  \"lucid and creative\" \n\nHowever I digress. Great show to get someone into 80s Brent Era dead.

This was a wonderful show, especially after the hot miserable Ok City show where everyone was a bit spent, I\u2019m guessing they were running on no sleep, too.\nIf I had to put my finger on the start of Jerry\u2019s physical decline, it might have been his 40th. While not immediately evident, by New Years it seemed like something was up. By June of \u201883, it was noticeable, although the shows I saw that tour were still pretty good. By \u201884 I decided to limit my travel to 100 miles. It was getting hard to watch.\n",
