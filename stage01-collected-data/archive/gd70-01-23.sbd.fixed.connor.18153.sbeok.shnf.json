The sound is very nice and crisp.\n  But here is now the truth, it has good moments, but I find it mostly dull. They sound like on autopilot mode. \"Other One\" and \"St. Stephen\" are delivered well, but not one you will say, 'Check this out!' to your friends. \"Dark Star\" just slugs along, never really finding a groove or even a space. \"Lovelight\" is just isn't that exiticing either. All in all, it's neither a good or bad show, just going thru the motions. Perhaps you will enjoy it for than I have, and please remember not trying to pick a fight, I am just giving you my honest review.",

Not a long show, and I imagine they had time constraints being on the bill with JA. But very strong playing has made this a well traded favorite.\nThe Black Peter is soulful and well sung. But the last segment is really where they cook. Nice long versions of The Other One and Dark Star- rare in 1970 to get both. Not as special as 2/13, but certainly gets you kind and with great Jerry jamming.\nSome 1970 shows have weak spots, such as when Bobby attempts Green Grass, or Pig sings The Rub.\nBut this one grooves all the way. A nice sounding SBD too! Kick back and crank this one up.\nBTW - this whole Hawaii run would make a nice Dick's Picks set, no? Tom Constanten's last shows with the Dead.\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

Just wanted to point out that the Jefferson Airplane did not play that night.  And the second comment was about the shows apparent lackluster.  The Dead just hadn't become the popular item they were to be later.  There was only about 75 people in the audience.  Hard for a group to get really enthused about playing when there is such a small crowd.  The auditorium would probably hold 2500 if it was filled to capacity.  I still enjoyed the show a lot.",

What's available from '70 is a little more spotty but this one is a standout. China Cat has a nice long transition to a great Rider. Skip the yellow dog story. Bob never was able to tell a joke. Hard to Handle is always welcome from Pig. TOO is very hardcore and transitions long into Cryptical which transitions real nice into DS. The DS may be my favorite all-time from this era. Lovelight is very eventful with some early Jerry slide in the middle but something happens around 31:48 like a cut into a Jam... not sure what's going on there, but am curious. The sound quality is really good and you can even hear some audience, which always gives a SBD more life.",

Something has really changed for the better here: this Dark Star' energy is quite up to the standards of early 1969, as compared with more recent ones previous to this. Is Garcia still playing that brown Strat here? It sounds like it, so maybe by this show he's getting used to the wider frets, bitier sound, etc....?",

Incredible mix.  \n\nSeond:  As many have noted, from Good Lovin' onwards this is every bit as magnificent and inspired as 2-13-70 and, at times, better than that.  The Cryptical reprise goes in a completely different direction than 2-13 but does not fail to decimate. The Dark Star shares a fair amount of DNA with 2-13, to be sure, but that can only be a good thing (out of respect for this Dark Star, I'm going to listen to it about twenty or thirty more times, I think, before I return to the 2-13 version). Every so often Bear dials the sound system into the bleeding edge of shrieking feedback (or beyond -- check out the \"quiet\" part of St. Stephen!).\n\nThis is a surely one of the most entertaining Lovelight's in the Archive. Thirty six minutes of greasy, groovy rock and roll. Maybe Jerry's hottest ever slide guitar on tape. What got into him? The tropical island air?\n\nAnd who is the immortal freak \"gettin' it on\" with Pigpen in Lovelight (e.g., around 11:30-?  It doesn't sound like one of the Dead. It's someone else but the person doesn't seem to be identified anywhere.  One of the Airplane, perhaps (I think they shared a bill with the Dead for the Hawaii shows)?

      "review_text": "Upuupu <br />This was the first show in Hawaii (after being cancelled both of the previous 2 years). They only went there twice, for four shows, all in '70. As others have already pointed out, this show lacks spark. There is certainly some GOGD \u2013 Black Peter ain't bad, though there are much better shows in early '70, including the following night. An interesting aspect, though, was the wealthy young dilettante \"singer\" who opened the show in a promoter-instigated publicity stunt.  Michael Brody, aka \"The Oleo Heir\", had appeared, sensationally, on Ed Sullivan on the 18th, where he was allowed to play the one song he had learned \u2013 after months of wild claims and press attention, one of which was that he was one of the world's greatest musicians (oleomargarine, iydk, is life-shortening hydrogenated trans fat, dyed yellow). When the Dead deplaned, the press besieged them with questions about Brody, of whom they knew nothing, nor that he was on the bill (Jer came from L.A., where he was recording incidentals for Antonioni). He opened with his one song (a very rough You Ain't Going Nowhere), threw 300 Washingtons (a sack of bills demanded from the promoter) at the small crowd, then angrily refused to appear the next night. <a href=\"https://www.oleoheir.com/home\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\">Chapter 14</a> tells the story, as does the doc Dear Mr. Brody, and his single is on YouTube. Mental illness was shoved under the rug in those days, and therefore not as recognizable as today, where events such as this are usually circumvented. After hearing the story, Graham gave Jer a copy of the rare single (this can be heard at the beginning of 2/8/70). Brody was followed by Pilfredge Sump, September Morn, and then Sun &amp; the Moon, leaving a narrower time slot for the Dead. The OFF has most of the show and was likely released for its better qual, restoring missing tunings, circulating the partial Casey Jones, and for adding 4min47secs to Love Light (though still incomplete). Still unrecoverable are the rest of Casey Jones and the beginning of Dire Wolf.\n\nJust one long set. A <i>China&gt;Rider</i> opener is solid enough to open the bus doors for the Hawaiians. After years of thick psychedelia, you can hear Jer relish his new song, <i>Black Peter</i>. It's the best of the show, though the next night has an era best. <i>Hard to Handle</i> trainwrecks when Pig confuses all the verses and throws the band off. Then Bobby trainwrecks the first verse of <i>Mama Tried</i>. An excerpt of <i>Casey Jones</i> is on the OFF. We're missing the very beginning of <i>Dire Wolf</i>, but it sounds like either somebody shouts for the Coasters' Searchin', or Pig calls it. Either way he teases Jer's retort by singing a measure (off mic). Jer was close, but the song didn't exist until '57. <i>Good Lovin'</i> is on the bland side, but the next night again has an era best. <i>The Other One</i> is solid enough, if very generic, but the closing <i>Cryptical</i> just isn't very inspired. This is T.C.'s final <i>Dark Star</i>. It's fairly standard, with a Sputnik jam @10mins, but then @15\u00bdmins Jer returns to another early '69 theme that had been mostly abandoned.   It's been said that Tom plays glockenspiel, but I hear none. The first two months of '70 have 8 Dark Stars, of which a whopping 5 are all-timers; but of course they can't all be. The SBD has a cut @11:33 [probably missing less than 20secs]. The OFF has an additional 6sec edit @11:40 to hide the cut. <i>St.Stephen</i> is affable, but <i>Love Light</i> is just not a good version; in fact with the vapid sections so lengthy, it's one of the worst. With the extra mins added by the OFF, we have nearly 37mins [@36:46 the OFF switches to 5/15/70b]. Assuming it went on for another few mins, it may have been the longest one. A guest comes on-mic @11:35 \u2013 probably from one of the openers. A slide player starts @16:10, and it has been assumed it's the guest singer, but it's Jer.  \n\nOverall = C  \u00a0 2\u2153 stars\n\nHighlights:\nnone rank for the era\n\nSOURCES: The fixed_connor_18153 is an improved SBD but it still runs slow, <u>needing +1% pitch correction</u>, except from Dire Wolf through the first 6mins of Dark Star, which <u>need +2% pitch</u>. <b>Dave's 19</b> has most of the show, and needs <u>+1% pitch</u> from Dire Wolf through 5min54secs in Dark Star.",
