      "review_text": "Initial thoughts (5-04) and ... For the SBD quality, I'd give this a four.  Phil's bass at the start of Scarlet is severely muted, as if he's plucking cat gut.  Garcia takes his typical three turns, each pleasant, with some melody to his madness.  The jam is mostly a quiet one.  At about 11:40, he steps on the wah, and plays the little Fire intro (always sounded to me reminiscent of the Midnight Cowboy theme).  At the last byte of Scarlet (13:52) he starts in on the first sung verse.  A decent enough Fire....\n\nEstimated is pretty good, a flatter more muted \"wah\" from Jerry than, say, Spring '77, but the jam is long and winding, with some very fluent, articulate runs, and a starry night kind of feeling.  Unfortunately, the handoff into Eyes is not fluid; Garcia simply stops what he was doing and begins brushing the Eyes chords.   \n\nThe Drums/Space is 17 minutes.  At the 11 minute mark, Halloween begins....Jerry does indeed noodle a few round, wah'd notes reminiscent of Space from 1-22-78 and thereabouts.  And at 16:35 he does play Close Encounters, twice, faintly; Lesh dances a few notes around it.  Then Weir slides into Magnolia....This one is a little too plodding to begin.  Jerry starts late on both his breaks.  The jam gets off to a disjointed start, so the drummers try to bash a little energy into it.  All of them end up trying to throw the kitchen sink into it, but it kind of feels like a sloshy goulash, not a freight train.  Contrast this with three nights later, where Garcia seems to have some definite melodic ideas/feelings he wants to communicate.  An energetic finish with Donna, and Weir doing a little scatting.",

Jerry missed several cues, and only a few high points of th e night.  I had taken a friend who had never seen them before, and I thought he was going to be blown away.  Coming back after, he thought it was a pretty good show, I was just disappointed.  Now almost 30 years later I hear the show again, and have the same kind of feelings.  In some ways, the start of a long decline in Jerry's playing.  At some points (like the Estimated), a very strong show.  The rest of the band sound good, but very little creativity here.",

      "review_text": "This is a very good show I've always thought this show was underrated despite the afformentioned little vocal flubs and miscues and stuff. There is a very mellow, laid back vibe to the show. Jerry in particular seems way spacier than normal at that time. The recording quality isn't as good as the other betty boards for sure(there is some funky noises coming out of the speakers during the scarlet jam) but still not bad at all with Phil particularly funky in the mix. The band is playing very strong right from the start, the half step opener is still one of my all time favorite versions. The rest of the set bubbles along nicely and is quite pleasant even though none of the tunes reaches the heights set by the awesome opener. The entire 2nd set is wonderful, the scarlet>fire just plain smokes, I don't think that some of these reviews do justice to just how good this scarlet>fire really is. This version is just really out there, like the last reviewer stated, there are some very unique melodies that I haven't heard in other versions. The jam into fire gives me goosebumps and I still believe that the fire on the mountain is one of the all time funkiest version with Jerry hitting some very awkward yet cool notes with his mutron, not the longest version but something about it makes it one of my all time favorites. In fact, this particular fire on the mountain was my first exposure to this show when I heard it on grateful dead hour in 1988 or 89. It was the first live fire on the mountain I heard being a newbie back then yet it still has this effect on me so many years later! The rest of the show is strong as well, the estimated again is very powerful, with Jerry's mutron in full effect once again, stellar version. The eyes is nice and mellow(there is a slight cut in the 1st verse) and the drums>space is pretty nice as well with another close encounters themed space that goes right into sugar mags. Only one song after space, but this version of sugar mag is one of my all time favorites and is a real smoker. The same can be said about the Sat night encore, all in all this was a great show. I wasn't surprised when Dick Latvala wanted to release this show, unfortunately probably because of the recording quality and the overall raggedness it just didn't get the thumbs up. But this show seriously needs to be re-evaluated so I highly recommend downloading it!",

Doubledose, a reviewer whom I have loved for his highlights of tons of underrated shows, seems to miss the magic.\n\nThere is a very human yet spiritual sensitivity in Jerry's second set riffs that is extremely rare for anything post-77, except maybe the 1980 acoustics. Though experimental and necessarily imperfect, it's very loving...\n\nIn any case, this show is a keeper.

Yea, at the start of her tenure with the band she was sometimes all over the map screeching and hitting the wrong notes. By this date her singing is heavenly. She really is a great back-up singer, adding such sweet tones. Her harmonizing with Bobby on Looks Like Rain kills me.",

The second set is pretty much perfect, with one of my favorite Scarlet>Fires -- although, let's face it....they were all great by this point.  But Jerry really seems to be branching out here, and is definitely emoting more than usual on his solo in \"Fire on the Mountain\".\n\nSoundwise, there is a bit of a distant feeling to this recording, despite the fact that it comes from the board.
