I love this early version of the Other One with alternate second verse lyrics! The Clementine jam is so smooth and jazzy and the New Potato Caboose here is probably one of the best of '68. I love when the Dead really worked on their three part harmony vocals between Jerry, Phil, and Bobby. They create such a strong vocal sound that was lost after '72 and I'm not sure why. I think Phil or the band didn't like his voice but I love that high range yell he does! Great backing harmony that was always on pitch, just not a professional singing voice. So this show has the band at their best, playing tight psychedelic music. I also love when Billy and Mickey do their military esque in synch drumming! I remember listening to Anthem of the Sun for my first time on E and just marching along to their ratta-tap-tap beat! Check this show out for great 60's Dead!\n\nGreat sound, great recording, great mix! Thanks Charlie Miller!",

      "review_text": "White Rabbit as their generation's \"Dark Star\" This thing everybody keeps calling \"Spanish Jam\"...OK, WHY is it called that? I guess it could be sort of Andalucian or something, like bull-fighting music, but it really resembles Middle-eastern music more than anything else. Country Joe & the Fish did the same thing this year--called it \"Eastern Jam\", which is closer. QMS put it in everything they did for years. All because Grace had done \"White Rabbit\" with two bands already! It's THE SAME TUNE, folks! It's the Dead playing freakin' \"White Rabbit\" as an instrumental without the bridge and crescendo. It occurs to me that \"White Rabbit\" probably had the same effect on the Scene as \"Dark Star\" had on Deadheads later: people wanted to hear it all the time, and all the bands had people in them. I can just see Garcia at a Jefferson Airplane set, yelling, \"Gracieeeeeeee! White Rabbiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!\"",

And I read in Relix a few years back a Cippolina quote that he liked the jam so much that he integrated it into the QMS repetoire, which would account for that. As far as the \"White Rabbit\" resemblance goes, I see your point, especially regarding the regal cadence that provides the platform for the melodic part of the jam...but that can be traced back to Miles too, so maybe they were BOTH influenced from Sketches of Spain? Who knows, but that answers your question regarding the name, anyway.\n\nOtherwise, I'll give this show five stars, disregarding the brutal lapses, because the snippets we have are just so damned powerful. Primal and electrifying.",

      "review_text": "1/22 & 1/23 = 1/26 & 1/27 I think there's definitely a convincing argument that the end of this spanish jam is captured in the one song recording we have labeled 1/27. They seem to go together, though there is a gap. But more than just that song, I think that there's an even better argument to say that both this show and the one labeled the 22nd were in fact played one the 26th & 27th, as there's evidence that those were the only days the Dead played Eagles Auditorium in early '68. Deadlists seems quite convincing that this show and the 22nd are mislabeled. And Deadbase doesn't even have a record of 1/23 being a show at all, but it does show similar songs between the 22nd and the 26th, and I'm convinced that this pairing of shows has just been continuously mislabeled, but is in fact the pairing of the 26th & 27th for which there aren't full show recordings.\nSo, using Deadbase and Deadlists I feel that I've gotten enough evidence at least for myself to label this show the 27th, and the show from the 22nd should be the 26th. We may never know with no doubt, but it seems like that's the way it is.\nFor the show itself, I can't say enough about '68. I can't say I'm quite an expert of the Dead's total repertoire (I've only been hitting the archive and starting my Dead education for about a year) but '68 is always on fire, and this early stuff is as close as we can get to '67, for which very few recordings exist. \nThis is primal Dead at its best, raw psychadelia coursing through them, coming from a distant star and using these talented musicians as its outlet. The Dead certainly continue to get better and more expert at their instruments and their style later on in their career, more polished, but this is raw psychadelic energy that represents what all of us (at least I do)wish we could've experienced by living in the '60s. Can't go wrong with '68.\n\nForever Grateful for the love, music, and energy the Dead will always represent.\n\n\nEDIT: About the other one lyrics, deadlists gives pretty comprehensive details about which lyrics are used when, and while I'm not positive when exactly they started using the Cowboy Neal lyrics, it was before he died (Feb 4), as deadlists attributes the last date using one of (so there must have been a least a few) the early lyrics, and it does say Cowboy Neal, to 02/02/68, before Neal was dead. And I recall hearing this said in other earlier versions too, but I have seen evidence that there were at least a version, or possibly two, of the early lyrics that don't use Cowboy Neal.\nThe biggest difference in the lyrics is the first verse. I suggest visiting deadlists.com and looking at 2/2, as it says what those lyrics were. Also view 11/11/67 if you'd like, as it evidences use of Cowboy Neal in the lyrics then, as well.",

The rest of the <i>Spanish Jam</i> is correctly labeled (on 1/27) but the official release is mislabeled all the way back to the tapes at the venue.\n\nIt's known that the show opened with <i>Lovelight</i>, so the setlist would likely be:\n\nLovelight\nViola Lee\nBiODtL-17\nIt Hurts Me Too\nDark Star>China Cat>The Eleven\n/\nCryptical/Other One>Clementine>New Potato Caboose>Born Cross-Eyed>Spanish Jam>Spanish Frag(miller.97344)\n\nThe part from <i>Other One</i> through <i>Spanish Jam</i> is average '68 (with a pretty good <i>Spanish Jam</i>) but I prefer the parts on <b>Road Trips</b>, being above-average '68, particularly the <i>Dark Star>China>Eleven</i> sequence. \n\nSo, rating the three parts as a show: C+ \n(a bit above average for '68).\n\n<i>Highlights:</i>\nBeat it On Down the Line-17\nDark Star\nChina Cat Sunflower",
