      "review_text": "Freak Show What a fun show this was. Freedom Hall is on the same site as the outdoor stadium and some kind of small amusement park/carnival. What a blast, heads on all the rides, security with balloons. And that was also the last day of some Honda Goldwing convention so there were tons of biker types all over town. Shakedown erupted in some grocery store parking lot a few miles from the venue that morning while waiting for the camping bikers to evacuate/ gates to open for the Dead. Weird seeing thousands of camping bikers at the venue before our freak festival showed up. No camping for us though, I guess they knew better. Great show, I remember the Althea, the Spoonful, Morning Dew and GLORIA! Left us rockin and there were tons of hootin and hollerin in the lot afterwards. Good 90's show for sure! Listening to the streaming audio right now and it sounds pretty good.",

Thanks again for that...and those tickets...HUGE...the biggest ticket stub I have ever seen...\n\n...As for the show, I thought it was uneven but entertaining.  The funniest thing, and I'm pretty sure that it screwed Jerry up during Crazy Fingers, was when the cotton candy vendor thought perhaps somebody in the front row might want some cotton candy...he proceeded to move from Vinnie's side to Phil's side with the cotton candy over his head...I believe there were a few missing by the time he made it all the way across...\n\nI remember Jerry looking at this guy like...\"What the fuck are you thinkin?\"",

      "review_text": "TOP 5 SECOND SET OF THE YEAR! These two nights at Kentucky have some of the best playing of the year. Althea is so hot. Lots of slick  solos and powerful  ending Garcia is Cooking. The second set smokes. The intro to Vicim is the best ever. Phil kicks it of with a massive Bass Bomb. Jerry is very creative and really gives it his all. Crazy Fingers is probably the best of the year. Estimated too.  Spoonful was a suprise very good. Bobby was on both nights of Kentucky. He's Gone is amazing. Weir is so audible just awesome licks all the way through. No need to prefence this review with (for the 90's) They sound that good. The Althea and the Whole Second set and the Saint-Lazy River from the next night are some of the best versions of the last ten years. Last Time is played perfect certainly among the best. Morning Dew is a Monster Make sure you download the updated version.  Do your self a favor download set 2 play it on a nice stereo. The sound Quality is excellent. I wish more of the boards that summer sounded like this. Very thick and full sound. Similar to the summer 90- SBDs. Not that horrible monitor sound that is so flat.",

      "review_text": "Circus is in town I remember that there was a motorcylce convention going on around the same complex as the Rupp and all the fans; what a scene. I believe there was also some kind of amuzement rides (a ferriswheel comes to mind). I drove from PA to SC to meet a friend who had tics for me to both nights, then back up through SC, TN, KY, and camping out just over the boarder in Indiana. I remeber the shows being ok, these boards are nice to have to relive the memories. 3 stars for the shows and four stars for the SBD's. Thanks archives.",

      "review_text": "goldwings and such This was unfortunately my FIRST Dead show.  I loved it.  a few years ago I was living in NC, and belonged to a county club there.  One of the guys there told me that he used to ride a Honda Goldwing.  It turns out that he was at that convention.  He knew I was from KY, and told me that he was in Louisville for the convention. he said to me  \"you know who was there?, the Grateful Dead.\"  I thought it was so funny that I could tell him that I was there, too.  But I was there to see the Dead. :)\njust thought I would share that.",

      "review_text": "Yeah how about those Goldwings! Man, don't let any Louisville basketball fans know you called their arena the Rupp!  Anyway, this was a pretty good one -- first set is solid and tight, though nothing really jumps out at me.  I guess Althea comes on strong and Desolation Row is nice.  I agree with the comment below that the Victim intro is great; just haunting and beautiful.  Crazy Fingers is also great, though I wouldn't say the best of the year (I vote for 3/24 in Chapel Hill).  The Last Time hit the spot and you can never go wrong with a good Dew to close.  The Gloria encore was maybe a bit of a disappointment, but that's no big deal.",

I have noticed that this has happened erratically but somewhat frequently.  Is this a common problem for other listeners or just my pc at work? \nOn a different note, I hold no grudges with Bob or any one else who want royalties for gd music passed on to thier kidz/grandkidz, especially after freely sharing it for 30 years.  How greedy is that?",

      "review_text": "93 Louisville These two nights in Louisville contain some of the tightest playing of this very underrated year. In fact I think these shows have some of the best playing post-coma (yes I said it!) Jerry's leads are blistering and the rest of the boys are in fine form, including much miligned Vince Welnick. \nUnfortunately I missed the Stranger due to a lagging friend who's ticket was in my truck, he's lucky I waited, I almost gave the ticket to the kid parked next to us LOL! The Stranger sounds damn good here though. Bobby is in rare form, he is hot the entire Louisville run. Jerry's solo in Althea rages, you know this space is getting hot! Bluesy Wang Dang with more Jerry fireworks. Old school FOTD. The tempo on this version is closer to the fast 70s versions than the sometimes lethargic 80s ones. Jerry and Bobby trade licks and it is obvious that they are clicking big time. My only live Desolation Row follows with Bobby remembering most of the words. First of back to back versions of Dont Ease closes the first set.\nSecond set is pure magic. They dont pause for a second from the red hot Victim clear through the monumental Morning Dew. Jerry came out after setbreak with both guns blazing for a blistering solo before they started Victim. I remember him up there just burning up his fretboard. Unfortunately every source I've heard cuts in at the middle of this jam. I would love to hear it in it's entirety, though whats here is still pretty hot. This is the best Victim out there, no other I've heard even comes close. I've heard some say Deer Creek 90 but I listened and it was black and white compared to this versions full color HDTV. Jerry and Vince build the jam to insane climaxes! This is how Victim is meant to be played, all others I've heard pale in comparison. A crystalline Crazy Fingers follows. If Jerry didn't flub a couple lyrics I would rank this Fingers up there with 3-24-93 as among the best ever. The coda floats off to a beautiful place...peals of fragile thunder keeping time.. Then comes the launchpad for the rest of the set, a muscular Estimated...fire wheel burning in the air... Bobby goes nuts screaming \"ooooh yeah ooooh yeah!!!\" Vinces \"sax\" solo even sounds grate. Vince deserves kudos here as his playing is spot on the entire show(not always the case). The jam is a complete meltdown, in a good way. Jerry picks the PERFECT moment to bust out the midi flute and sends the jam into the stratosphere. Then comes back to a tone that shakes the very foundations of old Freedom Hall. WOW!!! Out of the ashes rises a sizzling Spoonful thats downright dirty, Jerry shreds. Sweet, SWEET, He's Gone shows the boys in fine voice with perfect harmonies, Bobby also adds some nice rhythm here. Very good drums/space segment segues into rocking Last Time. \nThen the zenith of this show. My favorite  post 5-8-77 Morning Dew, IMO better than the overhyped 9-18-87 and 3-27-94 versions. I know I'll catch some flac for that but it's true. The tempo and feel remind me more of a hot 69 version than the slower 80s ones. While it's more agressive than most latter day versions, you can still hear the proverbial pin drop during the slow parts. Lots of dynamics in this 13+ minute masterpiece. Bobby is waaaaay hot in the mix(like both nights in Louisville) Bobby is playing lead lines along with Jerry during most of the song, contributing to a very unique vibe. One of my most cherished live/Dead memories will always be seeing Bobby and Jerry up there bathed in blue light guitar lines intertwined in a most beautiful way. It reminds me of the subtle interplay between Jerry and Bobby on the classic Europe '72 version. Speaking of 72, Jerrys vocal also harkens back to that venerable year. After laying down some unbelievably hot runs in the first jam, he slows it waaay down and treats us to some very tender and nuanced leads before he fans out at the end with Phil dropping some huge bombs for the incredible climax, I GUESS IT DOESNT MATTER ANYWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!.\nRare Gloria rocks hard as the encore and sent all in attendance home with a smile, knowing we had just witnessed the Grateful Dead magic in all its glory. I know alot of people will say that there are no 5 star shows post-Brent, or post-78, or post-Pig, but this show is classic latter day GD and I'm giving it 5 so fuck y'all!\n5 stars for crisp board. Much better than the auds I've heard. I'm still waiting for that Victim intro jam though (hint hint!)\n5 stars for old school setlist. Victim is the only song that could be considered \"new\"\n5 stars for the unbelievable playing. Add this to the legendary 74 Freedom Hall show as being among the best from their respective eras.\n(I give a show 5 stars if I think it is one of the best of that year/era. Trying to compare shows from different eras is impossible, the sounds are so different it's like apples and oranges)",

The '93 guitar sounds were very compressed and distorted by Dead standards, that effect is very evident in this soundboard mix, which is very crisp with loud pronounced Weir in the mix...Bobby in particular seems to be playing with his Metallica rig in some of the tunes...The Morning Dew is a great version, I was blessed to see a number of Dews and this one was up there, maybe 2nd or 3rd best I've seen behind Richfield Coliseum 09-09-1993...the show is tight overall, a very consistent '93 showing by the Boys...",

      "review_text": "Another Great Kentucky Show! Fantastic Soundboard version. Jerry's vocals and guitar are ON tonight! His lead phrases seem like the execution of complete thought-out runs, not a step behind, no matter how fast the riff is. Vince's keyboards are well mixed, adding to, rather than trampling over any given tune. Several cover songs are featured in this set, including a rocking Gloria encore. Also, Desolation Row for the 3rd straight Louisville show ('89, '90, '93).... maybe something we should know about? I'm not sure how often they repeated a song on consecutive nights, but the 1st set closer for both nights in Louisville was Don't Ease Me In...STRANGE. I had 5th row seats for this show, but considering state of mind, I might as well have been sitting in the upper deck! Is it just me, or were they always FAR AWAY?!?! As with any and every show in Freedom Hall, the sound was spectacular. Perhaps because of the tiled roof, the sound was/is tight. I remember the Drums/Space segment utilizing the house PA to create a surround-sound effect that shows up on this recording, but would be over-the-top if done on a 5:1 mix. And, closing the 2nd set with a bouncy The Last Time into Morning Dew that is truly inspired! One of the best from '93, check this one out.",
