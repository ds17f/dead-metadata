As for the tunes, the stuff that makes this a stand-out is (surprise) in the pre-drums segment - esp. the Fingers -> Playin.  For my money, though, it's the Dew that keeps me comin' back to this show.  Just huge.  The Let Phil Sing banter is pretty funny, complete with a request for volunteers from the audience!  Now THAT would've been a good time!",

To me, Oxford was the height of Bobby's wannabe-ness.\n\nA particularly funny moment occurred during one of the choruses of Row Jimmy (probably the one right after the 3rd verse where Brent used to solo), when Bobby gets the notion to grab his guitar like a canoe paddle and starts paddling air--very purposely and seriously.  This is the genius of Bob.  Phil sees him, makes a jerky motion back and forth with his bass that clearly indicates to the rest of the band and entire audience that, yes, Bobby is indeed an ass.  Bob catches Phil out of the corner of his eye, becomes completely self-conscious, and sheepishly goes back to actually playing his guitar.  Sublime.\n\nThere was a lot of banter from the stage this summer tour.  In fact, I seem to recall them having almost like little \"bits\" worked out.  Punchline Jerry: \"Don't listen to Weir, he's been crazy all these years.\"  To thunderous applause of course.\n\nThe sound was magnificent these two days (at least from where I was squished on Day 1--Day 2 was back further, and the sound seemed even better out there).  I recall heads trying to get a Help>Slip>Frank chant organized pre-show.  The crude butterfly tattoo on the butt of an oblivious dancer stripped buck naked during the first set and having the audience part like the Red Sea before Moses as she majestically danced her way to the front.

      "review_text": "Good gig but Saratoga still stands taller 1st Set: Why did the city of Boston preclude the band from playing the Garden or any other comprable arena? In addition where is the Oxford Speedway in relation to the city? Anyways, back to business: \"Iko\" is full of assured energetic Jerry singing. Warm, easy-going feelings abound between band and audience. The drummers bring a solid pacing to \"Jack\". the version especially comes alive during the second jam section, Phil Bombs aplenty...Yea! \"West LA\" is standard. \"Don'tcha think the boys in the band are going to get jealous if you yell for me all the time. I want you guys to yell for Mickey, Bill, Bobby, Jerry Brent...Next time you hear someone say 'We Want Phil' you yell back 'We Want Brent, Mickey...' This hilarious rant then extends to each bandmember asserting his own goofy lines...demanding that the crowd screams the same for the crew, \"We Want Steve.\"\nAnd you know, Phil's right... he's the frickin bass player, and has two songs in his repertoire at the moment... lay off.\n\"Memphis Blues\" is finely contoured, but I always appreciated when this song was in the after-ballad slot as we're moving to \"Row.\" Bobby and Brent's activity help it move beyond the trudgery that sometimes afflicts stationary versions. \"Blow\"'s verses don't impress but you get a sense with the outro how impressively frantic if they choose to extend it beyond the song structure. There's more forward momentum than usual in this typically frightening \"Victim.\" After the stand-alone song \"Foolish\" is quickly ushered in to seemingly close the set. It's fine but kinda fades away unconvincingly...the stirring requires more of a climax I do believe.\n\n2nd Set: Twas a surprise to me that the set started out on a \"Crazy\" note considering the subdued nature of how the first concluded. That being said, this version flows magnificently, especially during the final couple of minutes.   Nice rimmin' skiffle during \"Playin\"'s second verse...the band liftoffs afterwards making me extremely bitter towards my boss who's present... preventing me from spinning contorting my bod into desirable seizures. Predictably we end up grounding ourselves to do the \"UJB\" thing, which is good and all...but it's really a 'by the numbers' thing to do. If \"Terrapin\" didn't have verses to croak out, it would be a doozy. After four substantial songs, nobody should be shocked that it's \"Drums\" time. It and \"Space\" grooves into warmer regions signalling a lesson about the Circle of Life...ahem, \"The Wheel.\" Can we say 'triple threat?' \"Gimme\" is a decent rocker but \"Watchtower\" is the real ambitious barnstormer both in dissonant design and execution. Like most tunes tonight, \"Dew\"'s feelings are better expressed through the music than the recitement of the lyrics. Uhhh, that is til Jerry's desperate pleadings during the third verse. (8:00 or so) \"Sugar\" is an ease of a good time...but nothing urgent or necessary for the lungs.\n\n\"Mighty\" isn't quite at that level, but it's a simple clap-along. \n\n3 1/2 stars",

We've never before had to cancel a show because of you. Think about it. \n\nIf you don't have a ticket, don't come. This is real. This is first a music concert, not a free-for-all party. Secondly, don't vend. Vending attracts people without tickets. Many of the people without tickets have no responsibility or obligation to our scene. They don't give a shit. They act like idiots. They think it's just a party to get as trahed as possible at. We're all supposed to be about higher consciousness, not drunken stupidity. \n----->  Want to end the touring life of the Grateful Dead?

It's true that the scene was in trouble by now, and the fans were clearly the problem; but the fans were also the reason that the scene lasted for decades. The Dead were a social extravaganza and it would be naive to separate the band from the crowd.

West LA and Victim are excelent. Blow Away is about as 80s pop as the dead got, but Brent's enthusiam brings it to life. Foolish Heart could be one of the best iv'e ever heard. The boys are new to the Built to Last material and they are messing around with what they want for these songs. the result is opposite of the early In the Dark live material (sophomoric and often boring) these early Built songs are mostly better than the preceding years renditions and that is what makes this show a \"five star\" show.\n\nWheel>Gimmie Some Lovin' is always apreciated as is the clsoer Quinn the Eskimo.\n\nGreat example of the energy to come in the next year of the Dead's existence.",

I don't think they are head and shoulders above others, but they do stand out (both at the time and even in hindsight with the benefit of listening to them all again).  But I don't think that this night, in isolation, is a five star.  Together the two nights are a five star, but this one just falls slightly short in my book.  Aside from Jack Straw, the first set is not spectacular (it's very good, but doesn't hit that five star mark).  The second set, however, is where things get great.  The post-space section of this show can stand up to any other show I ever saw.  And we couldn't ask for a better recording than this (love the crystal clear SBD/AUD mixes!!).  \n\nThe scene:  Chard, Peter and I drove up in the bus from Rochester.  At some point I crawled in back for a nap and let Chard drive.  When I woke up they were both trippin balls and we were pulling up to either a traffic jam or a roadblock - I don't remember which.  What I do remember is that Chard's pupils were exploding all over his face and he was behind the wheel of my new baby with cops around.  I was, uh, worried.  Anyway, we made it out of that mess and wound up parking about a mile down from the venue in a little camp-type area with trees all around and only about 10 other cars.  The sun was shining, it smelled like Maine in the summer time, and it was a beautiful day.  Little Feat opened both nights, which was nice, but I actually enjoyed them more the next summer in Oregon.  At these shows, I don't even think I went inside until they were almost done.\n\nThe music: Set I: um, can we get a sound check on Phil's bass?  Yeah, that's nice.  Now turn it to 11.  Oh yeah, that's the stuff.  Good song choices.  Every song is really well played.  Energy is flowing freely.  Iko gets the crowd in the high energy dance mood.  One of the best Jack Straw's I ever heard.  Brent's piano animates Row Jimmy nicely. Blow Away keeps progressing, but at this early stage hadn't yet made it to where it ended up.  His piano solo on this sounds a little bit \"Little Feat\" influenced, IMO.  Maybe he was grooving to the opening act.  Best Victim yet (in its short life span), giving a hint of the better, creepier, drawn-out jams that it would sprout later in its life.  Foolish Heart is also getting better with each time out.  \n\nSet II: Crazy Fingers was just played two shows ago, but it's hard to ever argue that it's played too much, right?  The jam isn't particularly special.  The Playing jam, on the other hand, has Phil leading the charge and obviously everyone is really on.  Jerry takes things deeper than usual for this time period (and even deeper a few weeks later at Laguna).  This jam also allows more space (not in the drums>space sense) than was typical in 86-87 - that feeling that things can get loose without someone having to immediately step in and drag the jam into the next song.  Towards the end of the jam, Bobby and Brent start chipping in nicely as well.  UJB is good, but not great.  I was fully expecting that they'd go into drums from UJB, and was very pleasantly surprised by Terrapin.  The jam at the end of Terrapin is really nice.  A furious space follows an interesting drums.  Jerry is just going nuts all over that fretboard.  As I stated above, this post-space section is as good as it gets in my book.  Phil and Brent are fantastic for GSL.  Listen to Phil and Jerry trading subtle beautiful chops in Morning Dew and you'll wonder, is this really 1988??  Just like Terrapin was a surprise before drums, we all expected Dew to end the set, so Sugar Mags was a great addition.  Compared with most shows of this era, we really got two free extra songs this night (Terrapin and Sugar Mags).  This Mags has legitimate energy - not one of those end-of-show dragging versions.  Brent especially is strong on this one.  Quinn ends the show on a high note.",

One of the best outdoor venues the East Coast had to offer. Beautiful amphitheatre in a natural setting. I think the Rochester joint was a minor league baseball stadium, which was kind of bizarre. Oxford a wide open speedway/field kind of place. Musically, this was the best show of the leg. The Dead seemed fresh and energized for the show. I think they were inspired by Little Feat opening. This show is a good listen for sure. Thanks for the Matrix upload. Excellent sound.",

The speakers the band used were off-worldly - I've been to hundreds of different shows and never seen anything remotely similar.  People were vibing in some kind of lovey dovey Midyan Shekinah... picture people competing to hand you a free ice cold beer as you walked down the road. Everything was suddenly free, and fairy pixys were running around dispensing drops of liquid acid rumor had it the band had procured and dispensed to \"make\" the party.  There was liberal amounts of free Opium, or \"soap-ium\" and all us newbies were literally having out-of-body experiences.  The band was \"on\", as I would learn in retrospect after many more shows.  It was electric and possibly the largest communal gathering of freaks ever in human history.  And does anyone remember the closing song we all chanted on for an hour after the concert was over... everybody singing as we strolled back to our tent-city... \n\nMagical, Electric, Spiritual, the great hello and goodbye of the Greatful Dead.

This first day/night there was a special groove-energy happening between the band and audience.  It wasn't lazy and it wasn't forced.  Kind of like a peaceful stillness between friends or lovers; nothing awkward about it- just comfortable and time did not matter.  I mean, listen to Jerry during Row Jimmy.  I am swaying in my seat right now.\n\nI always have difficulty saying this song version is the best or this show was the best.  Each and every one is different and so are we each and every time.  There are different people, different scenes, and different intakes.  Isn't that why we kept going all those years?  \n\nThis JS is good but I like the angry energy from Syracuse 10/20/84 Jack which I also saw.  Doesn't minimize this Jack, just different stuff happening and it is what I personally like.  And if you are into the Phil thing, check him out on Foolish Heart although Jerry shreds the lyrics.  I always thought Phil separated himself on The Other One, but again, that's just me.\n\nGlad I was able to catch 60+ shows from 83-92 and a dozen or so JGB shows which were a real treat.

And you know what? It's cool.  It's a rockin' little show, tight as a fresh acorn.  Even in my dye-hard tape trading days I never heard of this one, or really, most of the gems I've found on the Archives.  If the Grateful Dead Archives were a movie Indiana Jones would fight Nazis for 'em.  \n\n(Now they've just gone from a really nice Crazy Fingers into an outstanding, outstanding Playin' jam- and that's cool.  Listen close for this Uncle Johns...)\n\nWhat's also cool is reading TDCarowindz's 7/2/12 review about buying an ounce of mushrooms for $20 from a suitcase in somebody's trunk in Maine at this show!  And about syvhead getting smoked out by a redneck and then seeing him at that (this) show later that night.  And Chirs U, January 2, 2008, who contributes \"too much processed cheese will make you sick.\"  Umm, ok.  I love this shit!  This is what makes the Dead the Grateful Dead.  Celebrate the music, celebrate the scene, celebrate the celebration.\n  \nEvery so often I read a review from what I have begun the call \"grumpy granola rollas\" who vehemently complain about the \"social/cultural\" reviews of shows and just want to stick to brass tacks: jerry's chops, bobby's timbre, phil's rhythm, the rating in a particular year, season, guitar model number, etc.- and that's fine and cool too.  It is a big part of the value of these Archives.  \n\nBUT- I must point out that the folks writing about the weird hitchhiker they picked up in Vermont or the crazy morning after in the corn fields never seem to complain about the \"music critics.\"  Nobody ever says:\n\n\"Yawn...can somebody please stop XXXXXXXX from yet another vivisection of minute 2:12 of Slipknot!?\"\n\nor\n\n\"If I hear another 'whoa- this recording is so crisp' i'm going to lose it!!!\"\n\nor\n\n\"I guess nobody can just enjoy the scene and drugs and forget all about the music- lame.\"\n\nGet what I'm saying?  So, just back off all y'all grumpy granola rollas, yo-  Puff on one and remember the romance and magic that was every Grateful Dead show.

Let's stop for a second and consider what was going on: crowd control experts estimated that there were 250,000 people inside the speedway and another 250,000 outside the speedway.  The Dead had their tower speakers they rarely used, and many of them were pointed outward so the crowd outside blended with the one inside.  Quite simply, it was the biggest concert in human history.  The Parking Lot scene was endless and everyone was in a most excellent and sharing mood.\n\nThis is me: my friends made me swear to take every drug offered to me.  We are sitting around a campfire chilling with about 60 strangers and I'm already on 5 different kinds of mushies and 3 different types of Bear, a ton of whippets and throwing down drinks when this girl comes skipping up, zeros in right on me and asks \"have you ever tried opium before?\"  Ummm, no.  So I had to try it and in a hot second I'm astral-projecting.  I'm still sitting cross-legged but i'm about 30 feet above my body, also cross-legged below me.  I can hear everything and what was cool was I could see above the trees and scoped the perfect path to the concert through all of these endless camps.  I KNEW RIGHT WHERE TO GO~!\n\nSome of you might remember that old Dead \"Soapium\" that smelled like it had been cut with Ivory Soap and Strawberries.  I don't think I toked Laxmi Dhoop but Dragon's Blood laced with Fentanyl.  That was the second time in my life I had lucidly projected and it was rad!\n\nOn the way into the show everyone was offering me free beers, which of course I had to drink.  Inside there were fairies running around with vials of fluff, which of course I had to take!  Hey, GDF guys with your wing-pins, don't talk to me about thumbprints bros, back in the day we got face-melted directly from the vials, I'm guessing there was enough in that dropper to make at least a sheet of white-crystal fluff hits!  Damn!!!!!\n\nHalfway through the show I had to go for a walk.  Keep in mind, there are over 250,000 people in that show and we didn't have a flag or anything.  I just had the mic-forest as a reference point.  I went everywhere and smoked some of those bowls that were the size of my head, and somehow I made it back to my peeps who were quite amazed!  They made me lead them on a tour of the place!  The worst thing - remember the Heads who threw down their blankets to mark their \"space\" and then acted offended when you walked over them?  DUDES - THERE ARE 250,000 PEOPLE HERE.  YOU'RE BLANKETS ARE GETTING STEPPED ON.  DEAL WITH IT.  LOVE YA.\n\nThose Oxford shows were amazing and the nights were just as awesome!  Everyone was partying like their lives depended on it and there was insane amounts of love and peace everywhere.  All of the newbs we took were transformed.  Those were no ordinary Dead shows!  I've seen lists of the best shows, and I've never understood how any of the Oxford shows were never included.  Absolutely amazing to three infinities squared times four eternities!  The largest gathering of the Tribes ever in human history!  And who can forget the end song of July 3rd: \"Not Fade Away\" where the band said goodbye and the crowd of half a million sang the lyrics for the next hour as we all shuffled off to our camps:\n\nI wanna tell you how it's gonna be\nYou're gonna give your love to me\nI wanna love you night and day\nYou know my love will not fade away\nYou know my love will not fade away\nNot fade away\n\nMy love's bigger than a Cadillac\nI try to show you but you drive me back\nYour love for me has got to be real\nYou're gonna know just how I feel\nLove's real, not fade away\nNot fade away\n\nCrowd repeats for the next hour: \"love's real, not fade away, love's real not fade away\"\n\nAnyone wanna rap about those days, shoot me an email \"fromthechrysalis@aol.com\"",

      "review_text": "Yes If you don't like this show, then you don't like the Grateful Dead. This is about as good as the band got in 1988. While it's easy to argue that the Dead's best years were during the first half of their career, there's a lot to be said for what they did at their best later on.\n\nThis one has a little of everything, or at least as much as can be crammed into a 3-hour GD performance. I often use the word \"amazing\" to describe the Dead's music, and it applies here.\n\nThe amazement starts out right from the beginning with an Iko, Iko. The song is a simple 2 chord sing-along, and you get the impression that these are serious musicians having a great effing time. If there was any doubt about their musicianship, the smoking Jack Straw puts that to rest. The only major flaw in the recording comes towards the end of this song, though, as the tape machine was no match for the Phil bombs. \n\nThere are great versions of nearly every song. The end of the first set was that place where the band breaks out the new songs. I've been to concerts by other bands where the new songs grind the energy to a halt, but that doesn't happen here. All three songs became mainstays of the repertoire, although I have to say that I wasn't sure what to make of \"Victim or the Crime\" when I heard it that night. It eventually grew on me to where I now like it a lot.\n\nI consider the Playing In the Band from this show to be one of the better versions of the era. Terrapin is powerful. And then there's Space.\n\nIt bewilders me why so many Deadheads seem to dislike Space. The Dead were unique in a lot of respects, but it was their ability to be creative during these space jams that really set them apart from every other band that ever existed. And Space from this show is as good as it gets. It's pretty amazing. And it transitions so beautifully into The Wheel.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the Dead's versions of Memphis Blues Again or Gimme Some Lovin'. The former has a  cool signature lick that repeats throughout the song, but the song is long and doesn't really build.. The latter would be a fun set opener, but it lacks the power to really work in the post-drums segment. The band makes up for it, though, with a segue into a blistering version of All Along the Watchtower.\n\nMy one other criticism is that the Morning Dew, like many of the later versions, is somewhat anti-climactic. It peaks too early, in the guitar solo prior to the last verse. In the best versions of this song, the outro starts off quietly and slowly builds to an insane crescendo. This version nails the quiet part, but the build seems abruptly cut off.\n\nBut not to worry! The Dead weren't finished yet. After Morning Dew, they tack on a very satisfying Sugar Magnolia to end the 2nd set.",

Walked to Speedway Boogie. I remember the crowd was laid back like a Maine Dead show. Sat near the free standing speakers and walked up to stage no problem. Great show lobster breakfast.",

I expected incredible things from \nThe Grateful Dead and the times \nthey completely exceeded my expectations are still some of my best memories.\nThis show is right up there for mind blowing \nmusical performances.\nWhy this show over the Second Night?\nJust a vibe thing I guess.\nI got launched with Aiko -)Jack Straw\nSmiling so hard my face hurt after awhile.\nBrent played Blow Away which was followed by Victim and a jammed Foolish.\nThree new tunes to close Set One.\nThe Second Set is just one classic \nafter another and fat with 5 pre-drums\na twisting SPACE and then 5 post space\nThe Quinn encore rang in my ears for days\nMuch like the RfK 86 -Satisfaction.\nJust one of those nights \nif you went away disappointed\nyou probably needed to check your face \nin the hotel mirror.\nGod bless the boys\nIn the barroom..\n",
