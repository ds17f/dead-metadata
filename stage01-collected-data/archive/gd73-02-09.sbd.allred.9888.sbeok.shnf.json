In spite of major tech problems and this being their first show, they manage to deliver a sparkling performance,including many historic debuts of songs like Eyes,Row Jimmy Row and China Doll that will stay on the setlist menu for years to come. This is what I like to call a \"greatest hits\" show that they occasionally played from 1971 thru 1973. No long amazing jams, but they load up the sets with your favorite rockers and ballads. This show has them all - China>Rider, Jack Straw, Box of Rain (esp. good I might add) Casey Jones, Sugaree, and so on.\nA show deserving of much praise. Also a great show for taking on long trips. In your car,I mean. Heh, heh. Give this show for Xmas presents! Oh,BTW the Eyes is amazingly good for the first time. For some fun,play this version, and then one from the end of 73, say 11/17 Eyes, and you'll see just how far the Dead can evolve a jam song in less than a year. A timeless and classic show!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

In part, it is the fantastic-sounding recording (Jerry's guitar is very high in the mix), but the performance just slides right down my backbone. These early (in some cases first...) performances of \"Row Jimmy\" and \"Here Comes Sunshine\" are my favorite ever. Perhaps my favorite song of the set is \"They Love Each Other\". Just listen to the funky shuffle they lay down! Absolute pinnacle of funkitude. I brought this show over to the house of a friend who's an \"appreciator\" but not a fan. We smoked a bone then dropped this one on, and when \"They Love Each Other\" came on, we simultaneously stopped our conversation, stood up off our asses, and danced with a \"this is just S-I-C-K\" smirk on our faces. \n\nDownload now and be happy forever. \n\nBless us all.",

Not so here, there is is a well mixed organic sounding show and the sound quality if A+.\n\n  Second, this show had a particularly funky groove to it.  Jerry sings like a man possessed on Loose Lucy and the pulsating vibe on TLEO can't be beat.  The Jack Straw and the China Cat/Rider are also quite nice.   Get this show!!",

      "review_text": "Pre-Wall of Sound fizzles and pops... Sorry to whiz on anyone's parade but the first set of this show sounds like a soundcheck to me (Bobby even admits as much after the first few numbers!).  And it speaks to the quality of the musicians that  a soundcheck by the Dead is better than most bands' actual set!  But it sounds to me as if *nobody* can really hear too well up on stage.  I don't think I've ever heard Billy play with less feeling than on this first set, as if he's struggling just to make sense out of the aural chaos around him.  His playing is heavy and plodding and fairly repititious - in other words, not like Billy at all!  Yes - there IS a lot of kick drum; don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of kick-drum too, but it threatens to overwhelm tunes like Row Jimmy in this first set, where Kreutzmann's subtle playing is CRUCIAL to the song.  I'd love to hear some details about the PA setup for this tour and how it might have inspired the '74 Wall of Sound.  With the exceptions of the Loose Lucy and Here Comes Sunshine the first set is sort of a wash for me.  THAT BEING SAID, *everything* comes together by the time of Playin in the Band: the PA system is apparently fixed and the band plays every song with a vengeance.  What everyone here has said about the great mix applies absolutely from there on out.  The early version of China Doll is just stunning.  The vocal harmonies on that song, Box of Rain, Uncle John's, are all amazing and crystal clear.  Then, oddly, for the Casey Jones encore is sounds like someone spilled a beer on the mixing console during the short break!!  Seriously, at first at though Jerry had a blown speaker in his amp, then I noticed Bobby's guitar was all distorted (in a bad way, like an overdriven mic preamp) as well.  Don't know what happened but once again I think it affected the band:  Jerry especially seems to hold back a bit at the beginning, like he's saying \"what the #@$! is that noise?\" before going \"aw, screw it\" and then just tearing into the song.  Anyway, those technical issues are the ONLY thing keeping this from 5 stars in my book and I just thought it was weird no one else mentioned it.  I guess it didn't bother anybody else?",

This is where, in Palo Alto, CA, Weir meet Garcia New Year's Eve 1963 at Dana Morgan Music (Music Store) and where many moons ago, approximately 640 moons, figuring 29.5 days for each moon cycle, I was born, at the old Stanford Hospital which, according to my mother, was on or very near the site of where the Dead played this night. So here we were, me around 241 moons after birth, actually, unbelievably, on a date, and the Dead 10 \nyears after meeting, enjoying the night together. As it turns out this was the only time I took a date to see the Dead. We ended up as far away as possible in the building but I consider this in my top 10% as far as fun factor. The girl was hot and I was shocked. Only my wife was as hot and I meet her 15 years later. It is probably the only concert I sat the whole time but that's cool as \nwe were enjoying ourselves just fine. Are you guys sick about hearing about me? I've just started my reviews. I have around 90 more to go. Click my name and you will find out more. You see the last time I talked to anyone that liked \nthe Grateful Dead, even though I live in their home territory, was in 1984 when my DeadHead male friend and I parted as long time friends. Since then I have been on my own. Went to concerts on my own, grieving the losses on my own. My wife thinks the Dead play Oakie music. What can I do? So I live in my own little private world of the Grateful Dead. And it is an awesome place this little private world of great music that I have adored since my first concert on 12/31/71 where I actually saw Pigpen with the Dead. The only time.\n\nOn with the show. I made one CD of the concert. In it Loose Lucy, Here Comes Sunshine, China Doll, and They Love Each Other are all played for the first time. And to think that I saw that! I love the dual lead in Loose Lucy. Garcia screws up some lyrics in Here Comes Sunshine but the lead is great. Weir is raucous in China Cat and They Love Each Other is played very fast. Sugar and Around are great. Sound is very good for being so long ago. This is a strong 4 star CD that I made, like a 4.4, but since I had such a great time at the concert, and all these songs, including eyes, were played for the first time, I am giving it 5 stars.

Is this the no-Hart days?\n\nFor instance, I get a really good feel for how Black Throated Wind goes, in many of the later concerts there is just too much music coming out to really hear the base, guitar, and drums. Some songs are not meant to have 6 instruments going at the same time.  It just muddles a simple melody.\n\nThe recording is OK - there are times it's crystal clear and times that it drops in and out.  I'm only on Me and My Uncle so far and there have been several drops.  Not completely annoying though.",

Doesn't mean it's the best, just sometimes you hear a less than ideal version of a song and you think oh well what if, and then to hear that what if, ripe with the purtiy of the concept, Donna Bob Phil and Jerry together, its well worth the experience.  Sure the new tunes will get better and different later on, but most music hits the ground running, less Lucy, Im a 74 fan, and Wave the Flag is unique, cause it only lasts a few months,we are very privilaged to hear them work out the kinks right in front of us.\nemail me at fieldhouse11277@hotmail.com happy to share with responsible listeners.",

      "review_text": "One rainy night I haven't heard this show since that night. I am not a tape trader, and I just happened upon this site a couple of days ago.  I had heard that this was a popular show with the Dead community, but I had no idea how popular. Well, the music speaks for itself. What I could add is that listening again confirms what I thought that night, which was that the Dead were loose and swinging. And I thought I would share a couple of memories with you all. \n\nI was attending Stanford at the time (I saw a lot of shows at Winterland in the early 70's, but that's another story), and me and my friends took turns standing in line in the rain and shuttling back and forth to Manzanita Park to get dry and smoke in peace.  You could get your hand stamped so you could go outside and back in if you wanted.  I think they had about two security guards for the whole arena.  I think we trashed the floor pretty well -- you know this is for basketball, this place -- so all the future shows on campus were at Frost.  Anyway, the stamp read \"DEAD\", and I spotted quite a few foreheads stamped. There was a lot of dosed folks at this event, and it was a beautiful trip for all.\n\nI am so glad I can hear this concert any time, even if there are some dropouts and fading in and out on the vocals. Jerry's playing is very creative, and the PITB, TLEO, CC/IKYR are only a few of the highlights. \n\nOh, I am 53 and I probably saw about 20 Dead shows total, some of which are considered pretty darn good (10/18 and 19/74, 2/26/77, and 12/31/78 are a few).  Happy listening, dudes and dudettes!",

Better instrument separation, tone, and voice.\n\nWhile I prefer the summer shows from this year, this late winter/spring tour is not to be missed. You get the very first versions of Eyes of the World, Here Comes Sunshine, Row Jimmy and more. This show presents the birth of the jazzy Dead jams that would come to define their sound over the next decades. Jerry is playing his tweaked 'Allegator' Strat which sounded more and more unique as the year would go on ('73 is also the birth of Jerry's customized tone; he moved away from playing basically standard guitars, like the sunburst Strat and various Gibsons). The proto-Wall of Sound was used during this tour.    \n\nListen carefully. This show will steal your face.",

Not only an extremely well played show, but it was this night that the band introduced the country to the proto 'Wall of Sound'.  While the sound clearly still had kinks to be ironed out, it does not steal from the accomplished and energetic music the boys laid down.  What's more, many debuts were introduced: HERE COMES SUNSHINE, ROW JIMMY, LOOSE LUCY, WAVE THAT FLAG, CHINA DOLL, THEY LOVE EACH OTHER, and of course the epic EYES OF THE WORLD.\n\nThis debut Eyes is interesting in that Bobby Ace's chords during the verses are unique only to this version. By late '72 Bobby had really come into his own as an accomplished six-string player, and one can here that vividly tonight.  His licks are lyrical with contrapuntal remarks that evoke a line of melody traversing a world of exploratory chord changes.  Check it out, folks!\n\nWhile things would only get better (see 2/15 Dane County), this whole show is a gas, and an essential slice of 1973 in all it's glory..",

In the meantime I've probably listened to most of the other versions of Eyes and/or China Doll from '73-'74, and some of those numerous times.\n\nAnyways, on my aforementioned \"return trip\" to the Maples Pavillion, I came to the conclusion that these two first performances of Eyes and China Doll were two of the best they ever played. I'm not sure I could say that for any other Dead tune (though I haven't given it much thought ... yet ... ).\n\nAs others have noted, Weir and Co. take the Eyes into a plane which is never revisited in subsequent versions. The transition into China Doll is great, and the Doll itself is insanely lugubrious, the climax a most relieving payoff. \n\nThroughout these two songs, the sound system appears to be working quite well. If there are any \"bugs\" in it, they either aren't audible to me or they are the kind of \"bugs\" that the band just flows with and which end up being \"the sound of that show.\" The randomness of tube electronics.",
