It is quite annoying.\n\nThis show has been overly compressed and lacks dynamic range.\n\nOverall good show.

      "review_text": "Yes, there was a little more to this show I had an old bootleg of this show that included a Bobby intro at the beginning in which he thanks Joan Baez for putting the whole benefit together. And while tuning, in between Franklins and Minglewood, Bobby announced \"It's a very special evening tonight, it's our drummer Billy's birthday. It's his 45th, he's getting pretty close to the big 5-O.\" Why Bobby says that, I am not sure, because Billy was 33 at the time. Also at the end of the Dead's set, the other performers join the Dead on stage for a final song Joan calls \"Into the Gap,\" during which she introduces the members of the Dead, and Jerry responds in kind with a short, soft solo. An absolute gem.\n\nThere is a ton of energy in this non-traditional set that far exceeds any diminuition one might feel it suffers by a few drop-outs or pops and crackles. I agree the dynamic range somewhat falters, but a little EQ work is all it really needs. The mix, clarity and definition are great. This is a hot, hot show.",

Note that it begins immediately after a highly successful Phil bomb.  Over the next thirty seconds, his signal is gradually resurrected that he might rejoin the ensemble (and as we listen on we wonder whether he is humbled by this little disaster!)  Just a hunch.  \n\nAnyway, I enjoy this tape as a scrappy artifact of a goofy little show.  Let us enjoy it for what it is.",

I think this recording is wonderful,,, and i agree that all the flaws mentioned by Ron \"the geyser\" Keyser are present. I even value the timely eruptions of blah blah blah the spew forth from your reviews Mr. Geyser. What I don't like is the idea that noone could possibly enjoy this show because you didn't like the click noise you heard @ 3 minutes into whatever you are listening to.\nThese recordings are not studio production recordings to be marketed and sold to a critical public. They are rather, a beautiful mark in time and memory... also have you ever really gotten into the flaws of a recording??? I know all these recordings (even studio ones) sound like they have flaws if i stop time while i'm listening to them... Dig?? or if i have imbided in certain tornado juices...\nremember tornado juice???\nAny way back to the show... very minor flaws, in my prideful opinion they deter from the show in no way.

We were partying and celebrating his return to normal life. Imagine spending 4 months in intensive care.\n\nAlso significant, since this show is only an hour and a half, the GD were full of piss and vinegar and really kicked ass that night in Oakland.\nJerry's guitar had that squawky tone to it that I especially adore.\n\nThis sounds like a pre-FM board. I say that because the bass is super boomy, but it is not oppressive. There are also little sound jerks and fits, but overall, the sound is fine. \n\nAlso on the bill of faire that evening was the Jefferson Starship and the Beach Boys and although I don't recall a thing about their sets, they were both excellent. Their sets were both way too truncated due to the constraints of time. Nonetheless, brevity often makes us appreciate things more, I guess.\n\nSurely was appreciative that night and in subsequent nights to come -- for many reasons.\n\nMany years later I befriended a man from Cambodia who lived through the nightmare that befell his country. His entire family was murdered right before his eyes. It just goes to show what kind of pain the human spirit can endure.\n\n5 stars for sentimental sensations.",

He was exiled from Iran and had pancreatic cancer which he tried to get treated in the US in 1979, the Iranians threw a fit and wanted him extradited back to Iran to go on trial for who-knows-what, and then stormed the U.S. Embassy and took all those hostages. This in turn spelled the end of poor Jimmy Carter's political carreer. In the end, the Shah was denied medical treatment and ended up dying in Egypt in early 1980 at the ripe old age of 60, the last of 2,500 years of Iranian monarchs. Interesting story. \nP.T. Barnum and the Shah of Iran, two infamous rich guys now surely reincarnated as dung beetles or sewer rats. Karmas a bitch!\nAnyway, great show, flat recording, 4 even. Peace.",
