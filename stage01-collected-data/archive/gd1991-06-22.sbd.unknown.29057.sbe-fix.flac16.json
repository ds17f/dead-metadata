Bruce teases Dark Star a number of times through the pre-Drums portion of the second set.  You can hear him trying to steer the band into it, but at every break Jerry kicks off a diffreent song - that great creative tension the Dead thrived on, the give-and-take, can-you-top-this kinda stuff.  Then after Space, Jerry leads off into Dark Star, finally - you can almost hear the huge s**t-eating grin on his face!",

Warm up?  Not too often.  The real treat was the Dark Star teaser and the great Shakedown jam - pretty hard to pickout highlights as it was alot fun for me to be there.  Overall, i really liekd this post-Brent show.  I miss Brent to this day and his Hammond B3 and leslie - he had the sound.\n\nOnly gripe I have, and I give someone else out there in Deadland the credit for this statement, is Vince's $25 casio keyboard voicings.  Yuck!  I thought Bruce Hornsby was an amazing addition to the Dead, but Vince's skills were lost in his crappy choice of voicings.  \n\nBTW - I just saw Bruce (on a total whim) in Vegas and the show was beautiful.  The guy is a true musician and deserves a great deal of credit on his own merits.",

From the moment Bucket starts up, it's a smoker, and might I dare say that the Shakedown (clockin in at well over 15 minutes) is probably one of the best EVER (notice I said ONE of the best, not THE best) performed. There, I said it. Give it a listen and tear me apart, if you so dare, but  I have a feeling by about 8 minutes into Shakedown, your jaw will slowly start a'droppin'.",

I remember looking over at a dude wiggling to \"Hey Mr. Spaceman\" and grinning my ass off. I knew the tunes but did not have the nuances down yet...so the Dark Star teases and \"goodie\" and \"jems\" sort of went in one ear and out the other. I had a copy of it a long time ago..but it was D- in quality. I'm glad this was one of the first I decided to listen to. 14 yrs later I hear some choice licks...Shakedown is classic whaaaa whhaaaa whhaaaa...I agree on this being the best Soldier...Maybe the 92' w/ Steve Miller is close...but by 95' the scene was crappy...concrete..cops...and bunk ALL around....I'm just glad I was there for them all at the Field'...Especially since they turned it into the Mothership...All we have are the music and the memories....",

I live in Chicago area by the way and seen all Soldier shows and lots after but Vince in my mind was the worst.I drove to Ohio for his first and lots after and like I mentioned in post he was refering to was his Keyboard playin and sound reminds me of lame Casio bubble gum pop. Cheesey to the max solos and on top of it his voice was horrible. Man, Brent was such a loss to the group and fans and of coarse family. Unfortunetly from what I read in Phil's book and others He didn't comprehend how much he was loved and was so insecure, wow he was dead wrong he was the best inmy opinion he deserved to be playing aside with Jerry Garcia definetly awesome counter part to Jerry and great blend with band. Huge Brent fan like many, The Hammond ,the wicked bells and buzzer freak sounds and his passionate sweet singing/preacher man bad ass.\n The some good jams on Shakedown Bluesy. Jerry midi stuff is pretty cool. I remember being up in front rows at this shows and during Black Peter and watching him pretty close and trippin hard. He looked like he was partying again and from whats in print he relapsed heavy on persian again. pretty cool shows, lucky we had Bruce. Dark Star tease theme was trippy for me and spacey in that roman pillar collisem spaceship.",

When i walked up from under McCormick Plaza and into the sea or tye-dies and VW's - i was in absolute awe. \nPutting my culture shock aside and trying to blend was a neat trick ...lol. Ya didnt have to do a damn thing but put on a smile , and everyone greeted you happily with open arms....or shot of shnapps , or a toke ,....\nBut the show itself ...well lets see, its their first time playing Soldiers field , and its a shame no one realized until 1992 that 2 nights were better than one. Looking back on this show , im dumbfounded by what i heard at this show, and realize  later in life what a treat i was really given. \nBucket opener - That became the Chicago standard for three years running at Soldiers - 91, 92 , and 93 openers with Bucket. I was so happy in 94 to get a picasso moon. But since this was my first , it rocked of course :)\nBut then Shakedown!!! I would jones for years to come before hearing another. Thankfully this one was pretty memorable. ALtho Wang Dang was you typical wang dang - theres something abvout having Bruce in the band that makes it stand out more. Friend of the Devil lends itself to be one of my all time favorite versions. The solos by vince and bruce , and later Jerry almost seemed as if it were the studio collaboration of how the song should have always sounded , embeded on an Album in time forever. Its just one of the most gorgeous versions i have heard. Brown eyed is a nice version as well , and later became a favored tune of mine to hear as well as Let it grow - this was a pretty powerful one too if you ask me. It just seemed epic ending the set with the last few fading notes of Let it grow , and watching the horizon behind Soldiers as the sun started to creep down behind the Skyscrapers. \nThe second set opens with a blazing Foolish that i love to go back and listen to. Yes there are many better versions of this song out there, but this one is nice and i am partial to it of course. Vince miscues the solo and jumps ahead of Jerry to drop back into the final verses - but Jerry just drags him thru another round until he builds the crescendo back up to where he wanted it , and then drops the notes . Its a great listen. Bobby belts out a very nice Looks Like Rain - again , while i know there are way better versions out there, espeically duets with Donna - this was still played very well on this evening and is pleasant to the ears. Now comes my favorite part of the trip. It was right about this time in the show that a guy calling himself Panama Jack handed me a stick of something i have never ever smelled or tasted before in my life , and have never seen since. I can tell you this -  Crazy Fingers -> Playin' -> Terrapin  - **drooool** .....*rubs eyes and looks again* Wowowowowow. This was the incredible highlight that whipped my perspective of life into a whole new realm. There were huge screens with wonderful animation taking place- a recall flying eyeballs - and a wizard with three shapes  - a circle, a square and a triangle all floating above his hand and they would flash out - and flash back in as the wizard would fade out - \nLooking back i cant imagine not having this moment in my life. It literally changed me. By the time Drums started , i looked at my friend in utter disbelief at this hidden secret he kept from me far too long. Why had he not told me sooner? He patted me on the back and said *Yeah , i know....* \nTrying to keep my jaw off the floor to hear the last portions of this monumental show , i didn't realize until later that i was about to hear a very rare occurence - one that teased heads all tour long during the 91 shows  - the ever elusive Dark Star Tease . \nIt was so prominant and there- ready to be played - i could tell by the look on other peoples faces that something big was about to go down. Alas , as the notes dropped off into the tinkling of the Playin reprise , a full fledged Dark Star was not to be born this night. But a dark star jam even , is a dark star nonetheless :)\nPLayin' reprise (which i thought , jeez , they already played this ...LOL) followed up the jam , and moved languidly itnto the dire riffs of Black Peter. Never on the top of my Jerry Ballads list , im happy I heard this still , and it seemed to fit the ambiance for my evening. \nThe real treat for me believe it or not was One More Saturday Night , as this was the song i first heard ever by the Dead  - and looked forward to hearing so much (since i was informed ahead of time i would most likely hear it , be it a saturday night..lol). It had the entire stadium dancing on their feet. \nFinaly ending the show with The Weight was as appropriate as it could get imho. I love that song , and it is a shame it didnt stay in rotation. Wanna hear a sweet one? Here it is. \nAfter wiping a tear from my eye - over the soundsystem comes Jimi !!! A recording of  Jimi !!!! What are they doin blasting Jimi over the sound system for ??!! Omg !!! They are blasting off fireworks to Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWhy o why didnt he tell me about this sooner? \n\nThe fireworks became a staple for the show closers at Soldiers. They happened every year after. Needless to say , i have never been the same since :)",

He was giving away tickets \"For a hug.\"  The driver in our group (Anton's girlfriend) scored a ticket for a hug, and was allowed to pick another \"deserving soul\" to receive the next freebie.\n\nSuch kindness and serene personality I had never witnessed.

Of the 15 shows I saw this year, this ranks #1.  Perhaps 1st day Vegas is close.\n\nThis Bucket>Shakedown opener is ridiculous.  Jerry's dialed in for sure on Bucket and his use of the midi-sax on Shakedown had me looking on stage thinking Bradford had joined them.  I've never heard him use the alto sax sound before or after.....it's usually the tenor or baritone.  Wang-Dang and FOTD are solid as is Masterpeice and BE Women.  However, shit hits the fan on the set closer, Let it Grow.  Bobby doesn't miss a lyric, Jerry doesn't miss a note and this is as good a version I've seen.  Again Jerry's use of the midi has completely changed the complex of the oldies but goodies (Eyes,Playin,Grow).\n\nSecond set is the goods........A GREAT Foolish Heart is followed by an adequate LL Rain>Crazy Fingers and then were off into a magical 30min segment that rages.  Playin>Terrapin deliver and in a year where the Terrapin Jam has found a life of its own, this one wins hands down.  The post-Terrapin jam weaves thru a couple spectrums and finally ends up in Drums.  The Space>Dark Star is another winner as they toy around with the theme for about 8min until Playin is finished.  The Black Peter>Sat Nite closer is also exceptional.  Unfortunately they encore with Weight.  4 stars because 5 stars are reserved for pre 1978 shows only.",

No way... Jerry cuts the jam short at the end.  What people seem to forget is that Foolish Heart was almost always good and is far and away the best song in the 'In The Dark' era.  Its a vocally demanding song, so there were always some rough moments for Jerry, but the jam offers a lot of space for beauty, and Jerry frequently took it to that kind of place.  FWIW, the best Foolish Heart I've heard is 4/28/91.  7/12/90 is a really big version as well, and the 8/19/89 encore is an excellent early version.",

      "review_text": "yin yang Thursday, October 11, 2007\nGrateful Dead - Chicago, Soldier Field 1991\nThis was my favorite dead show, hands down. I drove up with the infamous Lowe brothers and this other guy Rob Kohnfelder. A couple years later, I would grow to truly despise two of them. So much for the peace and love theory. We spent some time on the Southside of Chicago buying tons of beer at a distributor. Tom and John bought about a dozen cases which really weighed the car down. The suspension was bad enough on my little Charger 024 Omni. I miss that car - it was the original Saf mobile or as my father referred to it \"the fucking jalopy and eyesore to the neighborhood.\" We arrived at the parking lot around noon and the place was filling up rapidly. I parked near these college kids who were dispensing 8 nitrous tanks. As the day wore on and the lines grew, I got to know them pretty well. They explained how they were from Cornell University, snagged a bunch of tanks and decided to hit the show. There were 4 of them - all business majors, go figure. They had given the security cops $100 a piece with a promise of another $100 each at the end of the night. Probably a good idea, since the lines were 20 people deep and the swooshing noise form the tanks was loud. At one time, they actually had two lines formed. This pissed off Tom at first since he was trying to sell imports and these guys were making a mint selling hippie crack. He eventually would sell all his beer anyway. The Cornell foursome probably netted about $16,000. Not bad for a days work. Not sure if they went into the show or not. I never even found out if they were Dead fans.\nI had an interesting run-in with this Asian kid in the middle of the afternoon. We were standing by the car and we noticed this one hippie riding his bicycle while simultaneously hitting a nitrous balloon. I look to the Asian kid and said \"that doesn't look like such a good idea.\" Before I could finish the sentence, the hippie slammed into a parked car and hit the pavement. The balloon went flying and he was pretty skinned up. Fortunately, he didn't crack his head. After a couple of minutes, the banged-up hippie managed to get to his feet and ride off. I started talking with the Asian kid - he told me his name was James. James and I started walking the lot talking about a variety of topics - where you from, you got a ticket for the show, the usual stuff. He then said that his band was playing tonight and told me \"We should go check them out. I'm not going into the show tonight. I've got to play, but I wanted to come down here in the afternoon and check out the scene.\" I told him I was going to the concert and I doubted my traveling companions would be interested in seeing his show since we were heading to Kansas for another Dead show (that's another story). He mentioned that they were about to embark on a tour and said they'd be playing in Pittsburgh in a few weeks. I asked where and he said the Metropol. I was impressed and mentioned that the place holds almost 1,500. \"Are you guys really that big?\" He repsonded, \"Oh yeah, there's about 4,000 people coming to our gig tonight. We're from Chicago and we're starting a tour to support our national release.\" I was a little blown away. We ended up hanging out for a couple hours. Right before we split to go into the show, I asked him, \"Hey, what's the name of your band anyway?\" He looked at me and quietly responded \"The Smashing Pumpkins.\" A year or so later, it dawned on me that it was James Iha - guitarist of the Smashing Pumpkins. I always like that story.\nBefore the show, there was much speculation of the opener. Lots of people wanted to hear Shakedown Street which hadn't been played all tour. I explained that there's no way because it was Bob's night to open. They'll probably open the second set with it. On the way in, I noticed 2 great personalized license plates - one said \"BUCKET\", the other \"SHKDWN.\" I wished I'd had my camera on me since I used to take pics of dead plates, but I had left it in the car. We walked by this group of crazed hippie/college kids and they were smashing beer bottles on the lot. Just for the hell of it, I guess. Laughing up a storm and probably tripping their brains out.\nWe made it into the stadium right after the opening act. The weather was crisp and really windy. The sky was filled with a ton of colors and constant lightning strikes, but it never rained. They hit the stage and the place went nuts. Bob opened with Hell in a Bucket and Jerry would follow with Shakedown Street. This would be my all-time favorite dead opener. I couldn't have written a better setlist. I loved this whole show. Just had a tremendous vibe. A one-night stand at Soldier Field. Now I get it. They closed out the second set with One More Saturday Night and encored with The Weight. Quite simply, my favorite dead show out of about 50. Like I said, now I get it.",

Vince was a professional, very talented musician who was hired as a fill-in at what was probably known at the time to be the final years of a great band. He over achieved on his job description on later tunes like So Many Roads, Standing on the Moon and especially Days Between.
