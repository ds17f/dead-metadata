I'm not sure he would want his name known either as he sounded quite wasted and it became more comedic than musical at times. It's kind of like Bill Murray on peyote right off the range; he actually sounded alright during his blues impromtu forming unintentionally off the Katie Mae as he got the crowd riled up well and the band went along. But his contribution to the Not Fade Away was embarrassingly bad. It was like listening to a concert right next to a drunk loud idiot. The unknown vocalist's harp playing was amateur to say the least. He got the clue and scaled back his presence greatly during the Lovelight, at least until the tapecut....another great mystery in life. Pretty good sound quality despite some volume fluctuations sometimes caused by The unknown vocalist's very loud vocals. Could The unknown vocalist also of become the 70's-fad The unknown comic? This certainly could of been his start. Did Mickey have a gong that night? BTW, The Star Theater is suppose to be in Scottsdale, AZ even though The unknown vocalist might disagree.",

The group backed him up.  Later, by the time the band did \"Lovelight\" there were maybe 50 members of the audience on stage with the band.  The Star Theatre had a round revolving stage (now called Celebrity Theatre).  The band members were surrounded by crazed audience members (me included).  The theatre's still there, at 32nd St. and Van Buren in Phoenix.  I saw Bob Weir's band (Ratdog) there a couple years ago during a visit.  I also saw Cream there, among many others.  This show by the Dead was the best, though.  My first Dead show, as a matter of fact.",

After Ceballos's evil twin joins the band, I'm sure Bob wishes it had remained impossible....

This is what narcissism sounds like when it's jacked up on a megadose of psychedelics.\n\nAs a historical document this is interesting.

This site is such a vast resource I could(already have :)  ) spend years within its hypnotic collection.\n\nSecondly, I hope the situation for Jennifer Ryan turned out okay. I obviously don't know a thing about the woman or how old she was at the show,but I can't imagine the size of the instant panic/anxiety attack I would have hearing that message announced during a Dead show. \nThen the walk to find the pay phone or some desk? Coherently talking my way through the calling collect process in the sate of mind I would have been in at GD shows would have been nearly impossible. That was between the ages of 15-25, I Stopped when Ole Jerry kicked.\nGiven the time frame close family member  she could have had a close family member at war. Just like many of us do today. \nIf only the planet could coexist like so many of us do in the Dead community. Nearly 44 years after this show and where nowhere near the global peaceful state people must have imagined the 2000's would bring.",

      "review_text": "Amazing band and an amazing AUD Comparing the three differant recordings of this show, the most obvious difference is the reviewers' theories as to the identity of a guest singer (Elvin  Bishop or  a Southern California musician -- who later makes ihis own post, asserting he never went to AZ in 1970 to the AUD member whose review is pasted just below), Paul Butterfield on harminica, or just another AUD member, to te two and then 50 AUD members who got up on stagr with the band.\n\nI loved all the songs.  Jerry's voice is so sweet and musical.  Bob is crystal clear.  The drums are tight.  The while evening was a very good time for me to listen to three times.",

But I can\u2019t believe Cummings could ever be so painfully bad. I would\u2019ve given this three stars if not for the classic acoustic set tossed in. ",

      "review_text": "Jim Morrison? I was listening to this and before I read the other reviewer's comment about a \"second rate Jim Morrison impression\" I had exactly the same thought.\n\nI don't think it was Jim Morrison, I mean that would have really been historic.  But he was reminiscent of the Lizard King.\n\nAnd I don't think it was just some random stranger.. the person isn't a very good singer but he obviously is practiced in wailing the blues.  Who knows.\n\neven if we never know who it was I think it's awesome that they just let some person come up on the mic and start wailing his heart out.  \n\nThat's real raw primal Dead stuff there!!!  Love it.",
