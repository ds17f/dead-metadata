The 17th show rained for a bit but not the whole show, during the break we made a big slip and slide on the tarp that cover the grass field, it was so much fun :)  the rain songs were very appropriate that day and the show increased its quality as it went on but started out slow.  oh ye i remember before the rain they had some difficulties gettin the second set started and Bobby telling eveyone that they are workin on it, that they \"we're a democratic band\"",

Having camping right out the stadium was an unbelivable scene.  The show was great and you can tell the band was having a great time.

      "review_text": "RAAAAAAAAAAIN...I DON'T MIND That day will forever be seared in my memory as being one of the single best things that ever happened to me.  It was raining, so most of the weekend warriors were absent.  We got ahold of some great doses in the lot and there was just a feeling around that place that something great was gonna happen.  The Dead Set skeletons were mounted on the side of the stadium, outside, and cut out of that big Aiko eye stared down at us as we graced the west entrance. The whole perimeter of the stadium was adorned with tie-dyed flags, and there was a huge Steely right next to the fighting duck over the press box.  That stadium was definitely OURS for the weekend.  \n\n During the break was when things started getting noticeably weirder (what's new, right?).  It was a pretty steady drizzle at that point, and those flags were waving around the top of the bowl, birds were swirling all around the place checking to see what all the excitement was about.  Time was definitely standing still, and what was going on inside that stadium was definitely NOT connected to the world around it.  We were somewhere else.  \n\nAfter the break, the boys came out, I remember Phil blowing a kiss to the clouds, and they all grabbed their instruments and just kind of huddled up in Jerry's area.  They all kept discussing the next play, and looking up into the stands (and at the rain), and Jer was smiling and grabbing his beard.  Phil blurted something out about how they were getting to it, and then they took their positions and, in unison, all started singing RAIN.  Angels could not have sung a more perfect or powerful melody.  It blew everyone away.  That word at that moment changed my life, and I have a feeling I wasn't the only one.  Fucking amazing show from there on out.\n\nBe sure to check out the extended intro on The Wheel out of space.  Still my favorite Wheel of all time for that reason.  Bob is to this version what he is to that jam between Alligator and GDTRFB from Fillmore East.  Beautiful things were happening in that stadium during that song.  \n\nAnd the Attics.......\nI mean, wow.  I was on a one way ticket to heaven at that point.  I didn't even notice that the transition from TStones to Not Fade Away was like someone walking into a closed sliding glass door.  it was just ON, for me.\n\nGet this show.  It's one of the best of the later years, and we all know we need a little of that now and again.",

      "review_text": "My First Dead Show This was my first Dead show and my buddy Ted (who had just moved to Oregon) arranged for this to happen. I had been into the dead since I was pretty young, and knew that the shows were like nothing else but this show exceeded my expectations GREATLY! Just hanging out in the area was fun in itself. One of my favorite memories is all the sharing, like the time we were walking around the area and the girl in front of me just turned around and offered a bit of her chocolate chip cookie. \n\nBut the biggest impact was the start of the 2nd set. I was up at the top of the stands (in front of a urinal, if you must know) and being a huge Beatles fan, when I heard \"Rain\" kick in I can't tell you how stoked I was. What a great song in itself, but the Dead couldn't have done a better job covering it. I remember running down the stairs singing along, when I spotted another guy doing the same and we high fived. I still get chills just listening to that track.",

Coming from the Great Lakes I had heard of these legendary Eugene shows and the experience was more than I could even have imagined. I mean c'mon....even the cops here were Deadheads!\n\nI seem to recall my Brother & I came across some very good tabs and well....the rest is historic eh!\nExpansive...Magical....this run of shows.\nBeautiful times....Beautiful people.\nI sure do miss it.\n\nPeace",

      "review_text": "This must be heaven... This was my first show in Eugene and the scene lived up to all the hype. Camping in the lot and the afternoon show time lent a unique vibe to the scene. The Furthur bus was parked out front and Kesey and the Pranksters were in attendence.\nAs for the show its an above average 94 show, which aint sayin much. This show has some definate highlights but the second set on sunday(6-19) has the best that Eugene 94 had to offer. \nFirst set is solid with Ramble on Rose, Black Throated Wind and the set closing Deal providing the highlights.\nSecond set is magic. When they came out after setbreak it seemed like they couldn't decide what to play. The crowd was getting restless so Phil walked up to the mic and said, \"We're workin on it, we're workin on it. We're a democratic band...really\" It was pretty humorous. At setbreak my freind called the Rain>Eyes opener, the only time they ever played this combo. This Rain is like a ray of pure light shining down from on high, the vibe in Autzen was through the roof. Good vibes just radiated out from the stage. My favorite version of Rain. The Eyes that follows is no 3-29-90 but it does nothing to stop to good vibes. Lots of mellow strumming and sparkling piano. Samba in the Rain was well recieved and fit the vibe perfectly. This is a really good Saint like someone pointed out below. Phil does this crazy sustained note thing during the jam that makes this a unique version. Marathon Drumz into a exquisite Wheel with an extended intro jam. A stunning Attics follows with the boys in fine voice. Average Throwing>NFA closes. US Blues was a disapiontment as they had played it just one show before in Seattle.\nThis is above average for summer 94 but Jerry is still a bit off at points and the highlights are most definately found in the second set. The Rain>Eyes and Saint>Drumz>Wheel>Attics are pure magic. Those moments were becoming rarer and rarer by this late date.\nDecent Aud=3 stars\nRain>Eyes and Saint>Drumz>Wheel>Attics=4.5 stars\nRest of show=3 stars.\nI'll give it 4 for 94.",

      "review_text": "the Deal with Rain 1994 had some pretty tough spots for us Jerry heads... including the start of this first set, but the closing sequence of Black Throated Wind, Tom Thumb's Blues, Deal was excellent. It was awesome to see that sequence of Bob-Phil-Jerry to end the set and it was very well played.\n\nBut the reason I'm writing is to explain the deal with Rain. So the boys reaaaallyy took their time starting the second set. 45 minutes going on an hour kind of thing and the rain dappled crowd was getting impatient. So in response to the \"Let's Go\" vibe from the crowd Phil was all \"hey we're a democratic band\". That's what he was talking about on the crowd track here. Classic Stuff. And they launched into Rain, a Beatles song they were covering at the time. It's a terrific version complete with loud crunchy Jerry guitar. Woo-hoo. \n\nSweet little outro jam > after the Saint \"rain falling down now\". And yet another huge late-era drums > space and then yes The Wheel > Attics Of My Life. Another excellent sequence of songs and the natural, sensitive nature of the songs really gelled with the earthy Eugene vibe. Super good stuff.",

      "review_text": "I am on an amazing journey I am listening to every 1994 show in order, mining for gold. \n\nSet 1 Highlights: BERTHA>GREATEST STORY. Not quite sure, but this Lazy River Road might be the best I've heard thus far in '94. THICK Wang Dang Doodle. Phil really lays it down this set. Jerry is wide-awake for Ramble on Rose. Beautiful delivery, that is until he tries to switch from the Mutron pedal to MIDI, and it fails. He gives up after missing the key solos, and then tanks the lyrics lol. Very good Black Throated Wind, but 3/25/94 is still the winner thus far. \n\nSet 2 HIGHlights: Rain is back baby! Not the best I've heard though. Nice Eyes into Samba. Saint is quite good, with some cool MIDI effects thrown in by Phil (I think?). One of the best I've heard from the '90s. The rest is all very well-played, with a heady Drums>Space, Wheel>Attics (can you really go wrong there?), and perfect Throwing Stones>NFA. Very strong opener to the Oregon '94 run.  ",

I spent the weekend with a friend biking back and forth to Autzen Stadium to hang in the crowd and enjoy the music. Lifelong memories were made that weekend.To be fair, my 5 star rating has more to do with nostalgia than being the best live Dead show I ever heard, but there it is. Long live The Dead!",

      "review_text": "Old lady on Slip-n-Slide was me! @ststvnfa, this set of 3 shows were my last Dead shows ever \u2014 soon before leaving Eugene to travel to Iowa City, IA (go Hawkeyes!) to start medical school in my 30\u2019s (second career; first was Computer Scientist).  My mother was angry and said I was crazy to try this\u2026and other family simply feared I would be hurt by failing.\n\nI DID NOT FAIL.  I approached my education & training the same way I approached the rainstorm at Autzen on 6/17/1994:  I suspended self-doubt, remained optimistic, and ENJOYED the moments.  I graduated from medical school in 1998, and have been practicing medicine for the past 26 years and counting.\n\nAt Autzen in 1994, I saw much younger people running fast then sliding fast across the giant wet tarp covering the Duck football team\u2019s valuable artificial turf.  Looked fun!  So, despite being obese, white-haired, and nearly middle-aged, I joined them.  Just once.\n\nI sprinted for 20-30 yards or so, then SLID feet-first into the path where others had slid before me.  However, due to my momentum,  slid quite a bit further than the others \u2014 so far that I NEARLY crashed into a tall, handsome young man at the end of the course.  Fortunately he saw me coming (we briefly made eye contact right before impact).  Then, in an instant, instead of deciding to dive out of my way towards safety, he chose to spread his legs apart far enough that (to my amazement, and to the amazement of bystanders who saw the crash  coming) I slid right through!  I finally came to a stop about 30 feet away, then jumped up, ran back, and shared a mutually Grateful Hug of relief and delight.  PURE MAGIC!!!",
