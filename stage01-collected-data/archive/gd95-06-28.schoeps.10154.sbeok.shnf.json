      "review_text": "China-Rider Estimated-Uncle transition Well, I got the bus in my senior year in 92'. I was more than thankful to be putting away my Creedence Clearwater CD collection and jonesing for bootleg of any era at the time. \n\n  When The Dead rolled into town at the Palace in 92', I was bummed to have missed it. I made sure to get in there that following year and what three glorious years they were for me at the Palace. I was a local Deadhead and did my homework listening to what they were all about. I personally love the 94' shows \"Mickey Mouse theme\" \"Adamas Family\" pure fun, corny as usual!\n\n  But this tour, you could almost sense what was bound to happen in the following months. The vibes were somewhat weird as I remember, but the energy was just really powerful!Good energy and potent. The parking lot scene was having way too much fun in the hot sun, if anyone recalls the storm front that was creeping from the NW direction. I remember clearly as entering the show, the tempeture dropped slightly and the winds picked up a bit, the sun had slipped behind the clouds. Dark ones. All I was thinking about was if i left my windows in my Bus down.\n\n  Into the show was just more the fun and less the worries. As soon as they came on it was a roaring applaud. I was close enough on the upper balcony overlooking Phil's side. I could see Jerry and the boys fiddling around looking like they need some sense into what should be played.\n\n Mississippi Half Step! Well played, very fun and Highly energized! I have heard better but this is worth a listen.\n\nSchool Girl.......oh goodness! What a hoot!\n\nBlack Throated Wind.......makes sense, due to the weather.\n\nThe Music Never Stopped, I was bouncing. It was pretty much an overall short set, typical in the late 90's.\n\n  The Second set promised some great gems. I really loved the transition from China-Rider. There is something unique about it. If you listen carefully you'll notice towards the very ending of the China jam that picks up the speed as if your on a locomotive. The way the sounds structures out into the Palace is what makes this transition worth the listen. And to polish it off, the headlight verse makes the crowd go nuts. I can recall the lights lighting up the entire arena at that verse!\n\nAs for Estimated Prohpet-Uncle John's...I was VERY thrilled to have had this experince. I loved it. \n\nWhen you talk about mind telepathy or communication, strange but true what happend to me. I don't know how this came about when i was listening closely to the jam of Estimated, when the boys wandered down and stretch out and formed loose note particles in the air, all that came to mind was..\"Uncle John's\". I remember clearly at the point looking back up in my seats to another Deadhead who was standing and staring at the show, motionless he was, but a huge grin! and he looked at me, nod his head in agreement...and the first notes of Uncle john's was played. I looked back to see the excitement of the band, turned around to see that the guy wasn't there!!!\n\nStrange.But isn't all Dead shows like that?\n\nDrums was just underwater, Seriously deep electronic grooves and out of this world sounds. I was running around around in the upper balcany and surf seating. At one point I had left the arena to wander the halls and got lost to where my seat was, could't rememebr which hall letter it was. It didn;t matter, cause I was looking outside the Palace high glass windows to see that rain had come down. A storm must have past by. Just in time for space.\n\nEasy-Attics-Good-Lucy...all around fun, Not any highlights for me, but worth to have as a collection.\n\nSure enough when I got out the parking lot was wet, but no rain. I wonder if the storm was what made the selection of songs happen?? hmmm....\n\n\nSo for my rating, I give a solid four 1/2 stars for performance. 2 for recording. I have a copy and hear it much better, but still, I truly hope someone has greater AUD recording, closer perhaps?\n\nAll in all...worth the download and play for background or long car trips!",

      "review_text": "My dad came to this show w me If you see by my name, I was a kid when i saw the Dead. Was 16 at my first show at Deer Creek in 1994, and thats another story. \n\nAnyhow, I grew up in Michigan, and it was my older sister who got me into the Dead. She decided to ask my dad to come to these Detroit shows with us, and he did! But I was so young, I didnt want my dad to see what I was doin at Dead shows, so I ditched them both days and wandered the parking lot solo.\n\nThe crazy thing about this day was the storm that came in. Listen to this...so it starts to rain, and there is this trailer with a big tarp and a bunch of people were standin under the tarp to get out of the rain. The tarp is bein held up by a metal pole. Anyhow, the wind blows the metal pole down, and it comes crashing into my head! No kidding, completely knocked me out! \n\nI woke up in a car; some nice heads had dragged me into their car and revived me! Talk abt crazy! My head hurt, but they nicely 420'd me, and i felt a heck of alot better!\n\nAnyhow, joined my sister and dad in this show. During the China Rider, my dad turns and takes a picture! Embarrassing! But a great memory, lookin over at dad, dancin away.\n\nAs for the show, for me, loved the Half Step, loved the Schoolgirl, but the Loser, oh wow....almost brought me to tears! The sound was so thick and even though Jerry missed a few words in the middle, I was in awe. His final guitar licks in the center brought his solo to fine crescendo and i felt every drop of it as they came back into the lyrics....\n\nThought BT Wind was ok, then Phil on Tom THumb's was awesome. Big RxR was kewl, but Music smoked! Bobby screamin! Good jam to close.....\n\nI tell ya, it was my first China Rider, and that was the original song duo that got me into the Dead! Dont think it could have been better! IT is such a unique and awesome jammin China Rider, and especially the vocals on Rider are amazin, prob best ever! So much energy, and Jerry doin everythin he can to keep it up! \n\nFor me, the rest of this set is just ok, I loved the Attics, was my first, and I think its a sparklin version. Good Lovin was better in Detroit 94, and Lucy sounded great, was also my first. All in all, with my dad and sis beside me, and the Loser, Tom THumbs, Music, China Rider, Attics, n Lucy  make this quite an awesome memory. \n\nIt's my second fav show only to the last show, which, if you were on that tour, speaks for itself.",

      "review_text": "The end of a Long Strange Trip I came to this concert towards the end of a 13 year adventure with a fundamentalist seventh-day sect with wife in tow.  Her first.  Garcia died on her birthday and she wondered why the calendar I used had her birthday blank.  The crowd though damp was enthusiastic and I was happy to be there again after four years and free to really enjoy the crowd unfettered by religious judgement.  Estimated Prophet indeed!  Uncle John's Band, yes indeed! And the encore to remind me of my first concert in 1973, Lucy in the Sky!  Too bad this recording is weak.  \n\nI thought Garcia looked and played strong that night.  I couldn't stand Welnick, but hey, have the Dead been know for their vocals?  Phil surprised me with is monotone droned Tom Thumb - it was great!  Thanks to those who recorded this memory moment. \n\nBesides my baby getting a headache from the contact high - this was a great crowd of real deadheads - it was a great way to see them for the last time.",

      "review_text": "oke music I was at the palace this night and since then I go back to it thinking is it me cause there is some really strong points to this show I here that loser solo and my hair stands up I can still feel it like im standing there so not every 95 show was bad needless to say im very grateful! I was at the two shows in 94 at the palace as well his b day, but my first show was 92 deer creek 2nd night so the so many roads from that and this loser are some of my lifes gems as far as feeling close to jerry and I must say the significance to me is sunday was the 20 yr anniversary of that and they played loser at levi stadium I looked at the date and couldn't believe it so I had to share  and reading some of your comments really is a cool thing cause I can relate to a lot of em and a couple of you mentioned the loser in the very same way I dig it so be grateful and keep on truckin",

      "review_text": "Come on clap your hands Incredible experience, not my best GD show, but I drove up from Knoxville in my VW bus to see the previous night's and this show. As I recall there was a huge downpour just before the show? That's why the \"prayed for better weather\" line in MS 1/2 step got such a big response. Thank God I gave my friend his ticket beforehand bc he flew in the day of and took a cab to the show. When I got to my seat, he was sitting there, it was a miracle. He's sorry he spilled that beer on you, whoever that was next to us. Lots of older tunes compared to the night before for us Boomers. I'm pretty sure this is the final Attics, and it's actually not bad. Jerry's playing seemed on a leash all night. It was kind of a harbinger show and kinda short. It isn't just this recording of it, there's a disjoint that pervades a lot of this show, but I am by no means sorry that I attended!",
