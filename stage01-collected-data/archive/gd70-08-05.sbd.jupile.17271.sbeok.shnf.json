The mix is a wee bit off, but the sound is of excellent quality. David Nelson on mandolin is beautiful bonus. He can be heard very well in the mix.. almost too well. ;)\n The show is delivered with a laid back feel, almost like one can experience at a religion event. The crowd sounds very small, so must have been quite a treat for those lucky ones who were there.\n   Big note is there is a few songs that are ONLY HERE or very few other versions (Drink Up And Go Home, A Voice From On High, Ballad Of Casey Jones, etc.) making a GD collector drool.\n   All in all, if you seek rocking GD, this is not the show for you. But, if you want to relax and put another log on the fire, it doesn't get any finer.\n   Hats off to the legendary Jjoops for finding and preversing this rare for all of us to enjoy!",

      "review_text": "Great Show, Less-than-ideal Sound This might be an excellent acoustic set, but the muddy mix and the high levels of hiss kinda detract from the listening experience. Vocals are hardly audible on some tracks. A cleaned-up, remixed sbd for this show would be a must-have, but this lineage is mainly for acoustic enthusiasts and fans of the mandolin (which is mixed too high, IMHO). This arrangement of El Paso is very cool, and worth the download. Note that Bobby had not yet figured out what the real lyrics are at the end of the song!  UPDATE: OK, revising my rating up to 4 stars. This sounds much better if you boost the mid-range on the equalizer. Also, try shifting the balance to about 2/3 left channel to bring out the vocals and bring the mandolin (right channel) more in line with the other instruments.\n\nCan someone clean this up a bit and re-post?",

      "review_text": "Truly golden! The definitive showpiece of rustic 1970 acoustic Grateful Dead. From the moment you hit play, you're immersed in dusty tape hiss, intoxicating strumming, silky cymbals, and country-tinged vocal harmonization. Phil lends a pinch of carefully restrained bass, which is just enough to give the show more mass than you'll find in some of the acoustic sets from earlier in '70 that featured just Jerry and Bob.\n\nI think the drummer here is Mickey. His style is a little more \"diagonal\" than Kreutzmann's, and unless the song calls for it he's not as heavy on the snare, not to mention his status as a New Rider and his presumed presence at the kit for similar California acoustic shows, 4/18/70 and 7/30/70. Speaking of New Riders, an earlier reviewer gives us attendee confirmation that the mandolinist here is David Nelson, who played this kind of music with Garcia in the early 60's, giving the show even more of that reminiscent old-timey feel.\n\nI love the religious numbers, folk covers, and Workingman's/American Beauty-era material. It's tough to cherry-pick highlights here since the whole show is just gorgeous, but I think the Ballad of Casey Jones truly demonstrates the greatness that they were capable of with a couple of acoustics. Some of Garcia's verses are warm, legendary, and sentimental, others ice-cold, grim, and haunting, all accompanied by twisting guitars and fantastic backwoods instrumentation that would have the very ghosts of the genre's inventors tipping their hats.",

So if Riders were on tour Nelson could have set in on Mandolin or acoustic guitar while Jerry played mandolin. But did Jerry play mandolin?. Nelson probably knew the songs. \nRegardless a great show despite his and vocal mix low",
