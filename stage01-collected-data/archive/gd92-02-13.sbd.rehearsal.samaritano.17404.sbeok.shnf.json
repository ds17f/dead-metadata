This song was such a theme for Jerry in the later years.  I absolutely love this song, and it was one that I was really hoping they would have laid down in studio.  I think they could have really made this into something amazing.. There are a few live versions that show a hint of how incredible a song it was.   Just list to 6-8-1992 at the Richfield Coliseum - my all time favorite live cut of this song. Jerry goes nuts at the end!!\n\nAs much as Jerry hated to write songs (by his own admission), when he nailed it...he really nailed it.",
