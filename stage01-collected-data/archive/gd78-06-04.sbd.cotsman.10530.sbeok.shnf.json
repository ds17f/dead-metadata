Non-Deadheads kept saying after the show \"I didn't know Garcia could play guitar like that.\"   The energy level was unbelievable.  I never saw them come close to sustaining that level of intensity for an entire concert ever again.  I listen to this show again, and I am there.  Hard to say whether someone who wasn't there can really feel the vibe or not.  Wish that someone had sneaked a movie camera in.  Regardless, the Estimated/Eyes is among their best, with Eyes at a very fast clip with an amazing amazing amazing Jerry solo, and everything post-drums is simply explosive.  Set a standard that, at least for me, they never equalled.  Wonderful to be able to shitcan my 99th generation tape for this gem.  One million stars,and I am not under the influence of anything right now.",

And Donna has a nice moment.\n\nThe transition from Estimated is a little rough, but Eyes begins at a nice, snappy tempo.  At 5:20 Garcia really takes off.  He begins a wonderful, long trilling of chords after the six minute mark.  The tune dissolves around 7:40 into a beautiful airyness, then percolates nicely for several minutes atop a bed of piano-Weir-drums.      \n\nAt 3:55 in Space, the Motorcyle sonata begins...\n\nA good getting out of the ya-yas in Not Fade, Weir and Garcia trilling chords passionately.  Alas, Donna's contribution here is a little hard to take.  There is a very brief Nobody's Fault But Mine instrumental at 5:40.  \n\nGarcia's first solo in GDTRFB is fun; the second run is all chords.  Second solo starts snappy and  fluent; second run here is more great chord work, a bow to Chuck.  \n\nAfter all this, still had energy for Around, and  an energetic second encore Magnolia (Donna is far better here).  Them's were the days...\"Thank you very much and have a long, hot summer!\" (Phil)  \n\n(one of the wackiest Garcia solos on Around you'll ever hear.  First run, brillant.  Second, drops out, and scrambles to get back in.  Third, astonishing entry.  Fourth, wacky.  Crazy sound, indeed....).  Grateful G-- D--- dead!",

This concert was highly anticipated, we were completey \"stocked\" and stoked.  Unfortunately, going through the entry gate, one of my friends got popped for acid, and spent 3/4ths of the show in the Goleta jail!  somehow, the rest of us managed to put his predicament out of our heads for the duration of the show (which was pretty great) and then went looking for him in the Hell's Angel area after the show.  Almost got our asses kicked, but made it out alive, and ended up coming down with beer and chicken flautas at Serranito's after the gig....a truely great day to be a local!",

It was Elvin Bishop.  Nice show.  The one thing I remember Warren Zevon saying to the crowd was something like \"Hey, what's wrong with you guys out there?  You're a bunch of acid casualties!\"\n\nI got a migraine headache from being in the sun all day, and had to stay at a motel on the way back to Newport.  It was worth it. This was my last show until 1987 at Oakland to see Dylan and the Dead.  This show sounds great as I write this.  Just like I remember it.  Even my wife liked it!",

There were some high thin clouds & not a wisp of wind. People were literally hanging from the trees outside the venue.\n\nWe had to negotiate the gauntlet of CHP\u00c2s in their jack boots & Santa Barbara County Mounties to get in the place.\n\nIf I recall Bonnie Raitt was Warren Zevon's guest on Werewolves of London. He was pretty drunk and made some rude remarks about the crowd being burn-outs and Weir's girlfriend or something like that.\n\nJerry Garcia and WZ, Bonnie Raitt as well as some others did a tune or two between acts.\n\nIt had been advertised as a festival show and the atmosphere was rather festive being independence day and all, and the band seemed like they were into it.\n\nLooks Like Rain was very nice, Jerry's riffs felt like water pouring over a stone. Equally groovy was the Estimated/Eyes seque and GDTRFB was energetic. Donna Jean struggled as she often did with the live mix. Sugar Magnolia/Sunshine Daydream had us dancing in the parking lot as we left. \n\nQuite a memorable show overall.",

Not so with the Brown-eyed Women here, which is laden with heavy drums. Looks Like Rain is nice, and Jack Straw and Samson cook. The second set is fast paced and more experimental then most of '77, with mixed results. A great Estimated, interesting Not Fade Aways. The space gets tedious (the motorcycle is pretty funny), the Going Down the Road is marred by some ugly screaming by Bob and Donna. The last three rockers take us out on a high note.",

      "review_text": "Oh what an afternoon this was ! Just from the simple fact that the band themselves were hooting gleefully in the middle of some of the first set tunes, expresses how wow this was even though the song list was generic!\n     Please bear with me! I have a lot of technical explantions that are important to understand which are not immediately obvious simply from listening to this, but if your patient you'll learn something and have a deeper apreciation of not only this but other shows as well!\n     Before we get to that let me say some notable things about the openers; I know I am heavily digressing here but hold on briefly: Despite Warren Zevon who was the last of three opening acts (Wa Koo and then Elvin Bishop) being drunk and and getting booed off! In all fairness Grateful Dead gave him a second chance to open in Tempe, Ariz. was it in '82 or 83? Where he redeemed himself, with just good music i.e. no accusing us in the crowd of \"being possibly high on Qualudes\" and \"all 60's rejects\" etc. God rest him, it sure shocked him when I saw him in the restroom backstage at an L.A. Sports Arena Pink Floyd show in '87 and told him I was at both this U.C.S.B. Grateful Dead show when I was a freshman in college, (actually I transferred to U.C.S.B. later as a junior), as well the Tempe show (Needless to say Bonnie Raitt was standing on the side of the stage and I hadn't yet back then seen her play live so I was eagerly hope she would come out but not with this fiasco with Zevon)!\n      Elvin Bishop on the other hand was in top form as reinforced very coolly  by Jerry Garcia jioning him aalong the guitarist from this very interesting opening band \"Wa-Koo\"! What ever happened to them? Of course Elvin Bishop, was \"Struttin' his stuff ya'll\". But then he \"Fooled around and fell in Love\"!\n     Now back to the main event: If any of you attended the Greek in 87' where they were doin' the motorcycle thing! Well, this is were it was derived from! On that board tape one can clearly hear Mickey tell the biker not to rev. it up but to just let it idle unlike here; where this guy with the motorcycle obviously had a different approach!\n     For example, not only with the bike but with his monkey vocalizations too which he apparently couldn't hear himself with no monitor not realizing (and asking eventually though the mic, \"Is this fuckin' thing workin'?\") that it is going out over the P.A. before hand during the improvisational jam with Garcia doodlin' through his envelope filter (on by the way, the \"wolf\" Doug Irwin guitar i.e. the one in the movie since the Travis Bean had gotten stolen some time late the year before); (Wier unusually had a Ibanez double neck, and Lesh on the 10 button bass (Europe '72) but neither of them were in this jam until the motorcyle); while most interesting and rare Mickey Hart set some spooky Carribean rythmns using genuine steal drums! Not to mention some weird moaning and hollowing from Donna(? not visible or who knows maybe that was Bonnie Raitt or some other chick with the biker, in any case it made for a unique jam into the motorcycle charged Not Fade Away)!\n     Later I asked Mickey on his birthday in '83 Sun. 9-11 in Sante Fe, N.M. at the hotel about this. (How I came to be at the hotel : as a result of Southwest Airlines mistakenly sending my bags on to Dallas instead of Albuquerque when I was coming from L.A. and they also misplaced them on the way back too!) Anyway, they told me to go get them at the hotel where the band was staying at! So I asked him what ever became of the steel drums to which he replied that (being a bit tipsy, given that Weir had to help him walk on his birthday), \"Oh, they are too delicate to take on tour\". Yet Lo, and behold he brought them back out shortly thereafter at a few shows I saw, albeit only very briefly. (Like he said very delicate!\n     I once had two percussionists for roommates in graduate school who played steel drums; you see if they get ever so slightly bent they go out of tune! And one can't easily retune them as one can with a stringed instrument. Instead it takes a lot of careful beating of the metal into just the correct size of the bowl shapes which form each note)! After this he opted instead from then on, to derive that and other sounds he fancied at any given show from the electronicly synthesized drums which obviously by that time had finally achieved a more reasonable state technological funtionality (at reasonable prize of course)!\n     Unlike when this U.C.S.B. concert occurred, when obviously the state of the art for synthesized musical sounds beyond that of single note keyboards i.e. one couldn't in those days play a chord though with a synthesizer (with the exception that is, of Keith Emerson). Such that at the previous year's opening show Sat. 2-26 where they debuted \"Estimated Prophet\" in San Bernardino they had to plug Garcia into (on, by the way, the white Travis Bean, which had an aluminum neck, which also by the way, the only other famous guitarist to use one of these was in that same year '77, namely Greg Lake, since I saw E.L.P. play that year as well), so that Jerry could get the proper envelope filter sound, a Moog that Godchaux was, needless to say, very reluctant to play since he only like piano! (Listen to for example, the tape of Dallas in '77 where Keith very breifly plays a synthesizer on the beginning of \"Playin' in the Band\" and then suddenly he just stops playing keyboard all together at least, if I recall correctly, until they do another tune); (unlike Brent Mydland of course)!\n     Until later of course as you well know, when they finally figured out how to achieve this for Garcia, not only for \"Estimated Prophet\"'s envelope filter sound independently, (and others tunes again as you well know such as \"Fire On The Mountain\" and so on), without having to plug him into a keyboard! But additionally also, for his guitar synthsizer sounds in the '90s etc. and Weir, and Lesh, and as I already said the drummers too!\n     This is as opposed to, a comment in an interview in '79 in B.A.M.(Bay Area Music) magazine with Billy K. where he made reference to this, saying something to the effect of that he felt (at that time which is the key point here) that synthesized percussion was not satisfactory (as of yet)! And as I implied above, even Jerry's envelope filter in '78 was still a relatively new gadget being used first both the day before, as well as for \"Samson& Delilah\" and \"Dancin' in the Streets\" (disco arrangement) the next day at my first show when they opened up '76 for the Who at Oakland Stadium on Sat.-Sun. Oct. 9-10!\n     Despite Bob apologizing for being \"Horribly out of tune\" after the openers \"Bertha\"->\"Good Lovin'\"; this show really cooks!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

Yes, they are pumping out unbridled energy, hooting and hollering by the end (which seems to convince many that the music is great), but the playing becomes just a mess, amateurish.
