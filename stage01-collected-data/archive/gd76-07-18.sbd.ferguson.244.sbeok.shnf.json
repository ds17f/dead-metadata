Just discovered the archive and am swimming in the excellent digital version of this classic.  An excellent show to learn about the dead during 76-77.

If someone can show me a better show from 1976 I'll eat my hat. 1976 is not their best year, esp. in light of 1977, but this show stands out like a beacon, The second set is bascially one long non-stop jam. And what DON'T they play? All that's missing is a Dark Star. Just one amazing display of improvisational magic. The Let it Grow, St. Stephen and Other One sparkle especially. The night before is also very good, but get this one first and turn on a friend. The best show of 1976, hands down. A \"preview of coming attractions\" for 1977. Heavily recommended!\nDr. Flashback",

For years I had only a hissy partial tape of the second set that was broadcast back in late '76 as part of the King Bisquit Flower Hour. I had a 25 year love/hate relationship with that tape. It began with Drums > Let it Grow > Wharf Rat. The long slow transition into Wharf Rat has got to be one of my all time favorite pieces of Grateful Dead music, and one that I had memorized note-for-note.\nBut someone at King Busquit decided that the most delicate moment of the transition was the place for a commercial break! OUCH! The other thing that they did was even worse. During the most quiet passages of Wharf Rat, and especially Stella Blue, they faded in a fake track of audience clapping, in completely inappropriate places. It was like some idiot Metallica-head engineer was sitting in a booth and saying to himself...\"What's with this pretty ballad crap! I'm going to put some rock and roll energy over this with some crowd noise, just so our teeny-bopper audience doesn't fall asleep\". I used to grit my teeth every time I listened to it.\nBut now, thanks to this wonderful site, I can listen to the whole show as it was meant to be heard. And just for record, this is the most beautiful Stella Blue ever played! The lead from Jerry and Keith's spare, delicate two-finger counterpoints never fail to send a shiver down my spine and a big smile across my face.\nYOU MUST GET THIS SHOW!",

Its because there is Nothing Like a Grateful Dead show.  Arguing the merits of 76 versus some other year is like arguing whether the Grand Canyon is MORE beautiful at sunrise or sunset.  \n\nIts just plain silly.  \n\nI could argue that 77 was kinda lame in my opinion because of the lack of song selection (how could the best year ever have one measley China>Rider) and virtually identical, non-descript first sets (trust me, there is really no way to distinguish one night from the next based solely on first sets).  Would I technically be right? Yes.  Would I sound like a complete idiot, though? Double yes.  Well, that's what people sound like when they down 76... 76 was a beautiful thread in the tapestry that was the Dead's music.  Sure it sounds different than every other year, slower tempos and such, but it is precisely this variety that makes the Dead so damned special.  When you hear 76, you know right away its not one of the other 29 years they played.  You can't say the same for every other year.  I revel in 76's uniqueness, the quality of the shows, the nice recordings, the tone of the instruments... everything.  Just like all the Dead's music.\n\nAll that said, this show is amazing.  If you are open-minded, like so many heads claim to be, it will easily become one of your favorites.  \n\nPS: Sorry for the length of this rant...  :)",

The Dead are a dozen bands with a constantly change sound, constantly changing setlist. \n\nThe best year? I can't pick just one. Try '67, '69-'70,'72, late '73-'74, '77, and yes, 1976. All stellar, all different. (Occasional highlights in the '80's and the '90's Hornsby gigs, too, but with less frequency.)\n\nSome of the qualities of 1976: a renewed vitality and musicality after a 20-month break from turning. Outstanding vocals all around, and arguably Donna's best year. A return to some old standards (Cosmic Charlie, St. Stephan), but reinvented. And a new, jazzy groove. Other years have other qualities, other stylistic attributes.\n \nThe slowness of '76 is overstated. The tempos are not the funeral durges of the 1980's. \n\nThis is one of the best of the many 5-star 1976 concerts. The second set of this show is epic.",

This version has very melodic leads and an intro where Jerry incorporates some very playful phrasing into the classic riff lines. I\u2019ve listened to it 100,000 times and it still makes me smile. And I remember being determined to learn it note for note when I started playing guitar. Just one of the best Stephens ever: different and less spooky, but a unique interpretation/arrangement that clearly refreshed the song for the band and gave new legs to a former concert staple that would keep it in fairly frequent rotation for at least a few more years. As discussed earlier, there\u2019s also some real fatback from Phil throughout this show. Ohhh what I would give to have been there on this night\u2026but alas\u2026 I was only six years old.

Personally, this show doesn't start until Lazy Lightning, but when it does, it highlights each one of them SO well. It especially gives you insight into Bobby's amazing role with the rest of the boys. Donna sounds like a compliment rather than an intrusion.  The rest of them are equally on fire, except Jerry who is beyond fire. Some of the licks he plays can only be described with goosebumps. No words can accurately describe the beauty of his tone and direction, and listening to all of them locked into that space is what it's all about for us. This was actually the first show I owned because I found it in my dad's box of tapes int he closet. He had taped it from the King Biscuit Flower Hour.

Wow, great sound and plenty of positive reviews!\n\"Iv'e got no chance of losing this time\"\nThis entire Orpheum run is mighty sweet.\nTo me listening to shows from 76 has been a pleasure.\nThere seems to be a soundboard for almost every night with more or less pristine Grateful Dead.\nI never had or listened to much from 76 back in the day so this has been a real eye opener.\nIf you like this then listen to the previous night as well 7/17/76 which is almost as cool but seems to get much less traffic.\nNote: The Second Set of this show with encore is 18 songs! it is like a GD smorgasbord.\nLet it Grow>Wharf Rat transition = noteworthy!\nWharf Rat>Other1 (can tell they are in the groove)\nThat drop into St. Stephen almost sounded like the intro to Stella Blue?\nThis is one of those nights when somebody asks you after the show:\nWhat did they play? \nBest answer= EVERYTHING!!\nthey get all of Weir's lyrics for TOO tonight.\n\nConfucius says: Deadhead who wasn't into last ballad of the evening from Garcia, going back to the motel ALONE.",

      "review_text": "Lifetover First time listening to this show since the real deal. Saw three of these shows, sparking a lifestyle that was a little watered down by knowledge and  availability. Saw them at Kezar/OAK/OctWint and 3 outta 4 75s, but these were mine. Couldn't get the first night but 13, 16 and 18 were a there thanks to a friend at Pacific Stereo (I won the lottery for the closing of Wingtgterland there...oh yeah!) What to say...seated, but all were dancing. So much craziness. Where i am is where I was and will always be - free and unfettered\n",
