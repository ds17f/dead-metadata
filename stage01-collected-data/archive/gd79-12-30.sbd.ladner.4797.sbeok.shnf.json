      "review_text": "Some intense feedback! On truckin' that is as this asserts no identity for that audience edited it part; well quite possily Ron Elner formerly form in those days from Hollywood until he told me last time I saw him at the last New's Year's Eve show ever tht he was moving to New York (City?) or  Mark Severson on one of the other full audience recordings here available I knew from Seattle as well, both of are excellent tapers knowing what their doing but in all these 5 cases before getting boards, and then myself being from Hermosa Beach I got from Ron who also got the second encore from the previous show on Friday not on the board \"One More Saturday Morning\". But I still contend that that was the best show this was the second second best even though I missed the first two, I would have little to argue with anyone who has very good reason to say the first one was the second best, they may even think it was the best but I would dispute that. The most unfortunate thing is:\n     One must to take into consideration both this show and New Year's that Bob Weir was sick with a bad cold or flu, (it wasn't always Garcia who got sick from time to time).\n      At some piont Bill Graham says we are waiting for him because \"he is\" a bit \"under the weather\" at the end of one of the breaks!\n\nThis still needs serious reeditting & although I still maintain the true of  my assertion the biggest problem with it in terms both my having met Weir and frequently being not only in the same spot especially when either its daytime or here when unusually the lights being bright when it's usually dark as indicate below and therefore\nhe is able as well as many other folks who not only are close enough but may too be often in a consistent location is that even for me this is relaively early on i.e. only show #24 and only ~10 of these were those conditions true; futhermore virtually all of those meetings indicated below with him and the rest is at this piont still has not occurred i.e. they're in the future so obviously don't count! However, even though I can't yet say he would recognize me and as such be indeed relavent in some uniquely, rare manner as the case(s), if at no other time(s), here on New's Year's two years later and at Red Rock's in '85. Again obviously having no bearing on this occurrance! Nevertheless, it is still not nessacary, that is to say this is or something else for virtuially any other stranger can and does happan from time to time each in one's own individual way! Well, I still need to edit some more below but I gotta go has I also say below which was wriiten the last attempt to have this actually make reasonable acceptable sence for you the reader! But for the moment as of this wrting I'm off to (speaking of attending events similarly and so on) a Biochemisty seminar but I've return to enventually finish this because altoiug it may seem that way it ain't about me, it's about the band acting as a unit spontaneously vs. audience reaction be it myself or anyone else as was well accepted notion from time well before I even first started! Later:\n     The feedback section into Truckin' was most awesome! I enjoy this however, I almost regret being in my usual spot ~1/4 of the towards the board in the middle slightly to the left.\n     Hence, honestly here I'm not being delusional having talked to the man on various occasions here at this locality and elsewhere but not this time!  thus, he So I can always and vice versa often Weir could recogized me at least when see the sentence after the next one; if true otherwise, less likely for him and anyone else who is often in their usual location within some plausable distance range!(See my comment for Dark Star 82-1-1) Purely by random chance, the very moment when or one of those moments, of course this one in particular also the lights are pretty bright for house in general (when often as you well know around this time of many a show the opposite is true), that is to say at the same momment the dB level is damn near the loadest sheiking! I repeat: I usually enjoy this not ever one, but most of them including this one, however I just so happened to be looking at Weir and I almost never do the following especially becuase I usaully always no matter where or what band have earplugs in anyway, I momentarily let go of my binoculars (even though I'm already close I still use them, I'm not blind, my eye sight ain't what it was then, even so I like to see their fingers) and put my fingers over the outside of my ears and Bob simultaniously looks at me without my binoculars instead he sees me with my fingers over my ears and suddenly no lie: he and virtually all together they drop conciderable in dB! Now of course, its true anyway without this coincidence, even if it is also not true that it was indeed the very peak loadest of the entire show but nearly is close enough because thus obviously most likely then the following moment is going to be by definition unless of course beng nothe the peak but still getting loader which is no the case therefore looking at me ain't required it will be less load the next moment anyay, again by simple obvious definition and Bob's looking my way doesn't have to have any determinative influencal coasality at all. Yet it's not impossible even if it as is as far as the rest of them are concerned just coincidental since they ain't look at me not that somtimes again for any one else in their usual spot as well as wat I said before have talked to all of the but less and some at this time I still hadn't yet met Garcia, and I never got to actually talk to Lesh only to have us walk by each other in the future at the now torn down Las Vegas Alladin Th./Hotel or was it at the hotel in Sante Fe, I can't remeber, I do remember the same with Garcia in Vegas but not at the same time, I still had not talked with Garcia yet either, I met Garcia where they parked there cars at the Greeks first shows in '81 on Sunday Wier, the same the day before formy longest chat but not the first which he and the drummer's back in '78 I met Weir the most, and the drummers, but I only urinated in the bathroom with Brent here at Oakland Aud. but not until before show New Year's '81-'82, and not until after Garcia's passing, did I get to met Lesh, giving blood as some of you may have too? Got to go I finshing this reedir tommorow or soon since my machine at home is temporary goofy and the U.C.S.D. library be Friday is now closes?\n     I can by how much even it were not much differnce can still technically qualify, yet again on the other hand the grater the dfference the easier, naturely it is to be noticed if this subject is in one's mind which for virtual no one else (with the possible except of folks who don't like this sort of thing in the first place but the most in the bar or whereever by choice, I ain't disrespecting their taste, at least they're at the show) but me, the band, if it was intentional ans I still can't claim this for sure other possibly Weir alone without having been able to immediately afterwards to ask him if he he recalls, this (please see again my honest to God true story of immediately prior to backstage and during somewhere in the middle of (and yes the lights where indeed lower) 82-1-1 Dark Star) and even if he said yes he remembers about this night Feedback and eye contact with me, the rest of them, well you know obviously they are a working unit: Grateful Dead at their most unique forte, namely free form improvisation, which also you know, doesn't have always include feedback but it sure did this night! So I was kind of feeling like I might have stifled his enthusiasm for feedback because even though I was thoroughly enjoying it; it seemed the moment after I put my fingers in my ears and he looked at me they stopped doing feedback. Or was that just my imagination?\n     A good Lazy Lightin', Let It Grow, as well as Scarlet Begonias->Fire on the Mountain. A nice version for the second, (my first), of the return of Brokedown Palace, (since 1974?) etc! I always liked this and the 28th better than New Year's!\n\n     I'll write more later,\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

From the 1st tape I ever had of this show, Truckin' had been replaced with and audience version, but it's pretty decent, if not a little distracting. Tensions over the Iran hostage situation were boiling over, and thought this could be the last opportunity to see the band. Seems melodramatic now, but hey! They did not dissappoint. I had finally taken my wife to a hot show, and she \"got\" it. Economic versions of everything, Space included...nothing wasted, nothing ponderous. Beware however, tape speed problems in Around and Around. Sentimental 5 stars.",

Me And My Uncle and Big River smoke, as usual!  Even Ramble On Rose is good.  And what can you say about Deal -> Scarlet -> Fire -> Let It Grow?  Doesn't get much better than that!  The 2nd set of this show can rival the best of them.  Let It Grow just may be a top-10.  Truckin' into Wharf Rat is absolutely ridiculous!  JBG and Brokedown Palace are two of the better versions I\u2019ve heard.  And the sound quality of this show is sweet!  One could make a case that this show was a little more mellow than usual, especially after the 12/28 show, which was totally off-the-hook!  But WTF!  The fact that they played 5 shows out of 6 nights right after Christmas is mind-boggling!  I\u2019d say 12/26, 12/28, and 12/31 were the best shows of the 5-night stand, but I\u2019m just glad I have all 5 shows on CDs!\n\nBottom-line:  These 5 nights at Oakland Auditorium Arena were awesome! All 5 shows, people! 12/26 is Dick's Picks 5, and the other 4 nights are just as good. If you don't believe me, then just listen to the crowd during each show. I would have given anything to be at any of these shows. \n\nDoesn't get much better than this! Anything from Fall/Winter 1979 is the fucking shit! Go read my SBD review from 12/28.  Bob Weir was on another planet during this run! Then again, you could say that about Garcia and the rest of the boys, as well. \n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C.\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\nEast-Coast Deadhead",
