      "review_text": "First set: Not so bad, Second set: Bad. Firstly, this source I think is slightly better than the other one listed. This version does have a lot more crowd noise etc, but it is also a brighter clearer and closer sound compared to the other more distant muffled one. \n\nPerformance wise, this gets off to an uneasy start, Garcia managing to mess up the Cold Rain solo quite significantly. The first set on the whole is never-the-less not so bad, with Schoolgirl, Ramble on Rose and It's All Over Now being quite listenable. Lazy River road on the other hand is particularly weak, and Don't Ease is just not what it used to be. \n\n Unfortunately the entire second set is very uninspiring and rather dull. Even Phil sounds down tonight with a rather placid Unbroken Chain. Corrina is perhaps the highlight of the set, with Bobby trying in vain to rock some energy into the band, though a rather half-assed Matilda, making it's final appearence, dampens the mood again. After Drums/Space it goes slowly downhill some more, culminating in a VERY sloppy Throwing Stones. Brokedown isn't too bad, but you get the feeling they're just relieved to be finishing up. Not the worst show, and I've heard Jerry playing worse, but this one is just very lacking in something.",

It couldn't have been more obvious during Wharf Rat... and there are jumbo-screens at Giants Stadium, so everyone could see his face close-up.\n\nBut what could we do? We wanted to walk out, baffled by the cheers we were hearing while Jerry was literally & figuratively \"dying\" right before our eyes, but how do you leave someone who has been such big part of your life, fo sooo long?\n\nSome folks left, some (myself included) stayed for the encore.  \"Brokedown\" was as apt as could be, and somewhat redeeming musically.  My friends & I left with a heavy heart, but with those beautiful Hunter lyrics ringing in our ears.\n\nSomehow, I was still suprised when Jerry passed.  I, like all of you, miss him dearly.  But not as much as the folks who walked out early...",

I dont' know what it was like on the ground, but in the seats you simply could not hear Jerry's guitar the whole second set.  And that's a real drag.  But on the shuttle bus back to New York afterwards, my friends and I were talking in the aisle (standing room only on the bus) about not hearing any Jerry in the second half, and most of the kids on the bus seemed to have no idea what we were talking about.  They just hadn't noticed that Jerry was essentially missing the whole second set.  I found that the most depressing thing of all about this show.",

      "review_text": "The Music Finally Stopped Original post: The entire '95 tour was depressing beyond words.  First the ugliness of the scene up in Highgate.  Then seeing Jerry so obviously smacked out, tired, and struggling through the Jersey shows.  Watching him fight his way through this show I longed for the smiling energetic cherub of a hippie I first saw live in '74.  But I persevered hoping for some flashes of the brilliance that was once the norm.  But when I walked out of RFK after hearing Brokedown for what was to be the last time, it was all I could do to turn to my touring buddy of 20 years and say, \"if Jerry doesn't get help, the bus ride is over.\"  And so it came to pass.  As for this show, not the way I wanted my last home state show to be.  But I still wouldn't have missed it for the world.\n\nUpdate:  1st set actually okay.   But the 2nd set is horrific.   Jerry's guitar is pretty much turned off.  Guess Bobby the Bagman let him into his stash during break.",

      "review_text": "Indeed frustrating This show had much potential, but again very typical for '95, the band had to carry Jerry through this performance. This was my last evening with the Grateful Dead, so I obviously hold it close to my heart. Listening to it again is tough on the ears.  The first set is decent at best Bobby & Vince (YES VINCE) pour much energy into the vocals & instruments. 'Good Morning little schoolgirl' is a good example.  After Cold Rain & Snow though Jerry REALLY struggles in his songs. I had sixth row, floor seats for this one & I remember screaming to Jerry to turn his guitar up during the second set to no avail.  How can The Other One be played without him? I vividly remember Phil throwing his hands down by his side in frustration. Even if Jerry had lived I wonder how many more shows like this the band could have endured.  Highgate was a mess, 6/18 had many great moments, 6/19 another mess. I recommend this one only if it was your last show & want it for nostalgia's sake, 2 stars for that alone. Fare you well Jerry, we all miss you dearly.\nRob Pervere from Pioneer",

I had 5th row right in front of Phil. Yet I'm confused on all the bashing people gave this show. First of all we all knew Jerry was in trouble and yet we still manged to keep the faith, hoping for something to turn his fate around. With that said, why complain about how much you felt let down or got hurt by going to the show. Personally I feel there are some good things to be found here. You just got to listen harder. I screamed out to Phil \"song of the saw whet owl\" and he smiled back at me and pointed his finger my way saying \"You got it\" and then they played Unbroken Chain. That to me was a nice way to end it all. I guess I'm lucky to have had that as a lasting impression of the band. Jerry did not leave me with one bad note. I'm thankful to have been there for him. As far as this recording goes I give it a 3. there's better out there.",

      "review_text": "And so it goes This was my next to last show, and I went with some friends who brought their very young son.  The mother explained that they were bringing their son so that he could witness a Dead show before it was too late.  Her actual quote was something like, \"I think Jerry's up to his old tricks again\"-- and she knew that didn't bode well.  I remember Jerry missing a lyric quite glaringly at one point (in the first set, I think) and you could palpably feel the entire audience bottom out.  You could also feel Jerry's awareness that everyone had noticed, and he seemed to then at least try to make up for the mistake.  Ironically, though this show was flat, it wasn't \"bad,\" like the preceding year's 8/3/94 show-- which had an awful vibe, and very poor playing.  So we can look back at this one and think, well, thankfully our friend's 4-year-old son got a chance to witness the Dead live.  And what he saw still had some magic.  The audience certainly brought its enthusiasm, if not the full band.  One more thought: we drove to RFK the next weekend and that show (6/24) was actualy an improvement over this one.  '95 was a very up-and-down year.  The real question should be why the band insisted on dragging Jerry through it.  They ran him into the ground.  A shame.  (PS: Jerry's vocals on this version of \"Ramble On Rose\" are surprisingly, unexpectedly  strong).",

I miss him very much. He was not well the last 8 years of his short life; he was 35 when he passed. I was looking for shows and came across his name on these Giants Stadium recordings. I was standing right next to him both nights, as we did in DC a few weeks later for our final shows. 6/24 and 6/25 were perhaps the best on tour that summer. Either way, I love you Wally.",

No complaints here.  Why?  Because I\u2019ve listened many, many times to this Stella Blue, and beginning at the 7:20 mark I hear Jerry gain strength as he starts to bend notes in that last solo to find the pure tone he always struck.  And he then he proceeded to strike more than just a few.  And his bandmates were with him every single inch of the way, giving him room but propping him, pulling him, pushing him, and holding him gently just when he needed it.  Amazing.  Moments like that were what made so many shows memorable for me.  And for that reason alone, I\u2019m giving this show my 5 star rating.",

These might be the worst of the tour which means they would be the worst ever, not just by the dead, but by anyone.\n   Another close contender for worse musical performance ever by anyone is the Knickerbocker arena show during this summer tour.\n     There is not one good thing to remember from this. If I was there and close enough to the stage, I would have pulled down my pants, took a squat right there on the floor, takin' a shit, picked up that shit with my bare hands, and through it at the stage.  \n     This is a 5 turd performance\n\n  BTW, Phil Lesh spoke about this show. He said how they had to remind/tell jerry where he should be. Just listen to The Other One, Throwing Stones.

My mind turns to Jerry as this Sunday morning comes down.\n This is painful to listen to and im not certain i will return tobthis again until i listen to every show ive ever attended back to back when and if i ever stop running out the door every chance i get. Im still doing it. Took a long break after this one tho because musically this is about as lackluster and or painful as one could get. \nThe first set begins w a CRS that is missing the intro here so i will pass over the fact that its not the best. GMLS sounds forced and the ROR is weak as well. IAON picks it up just a bit. A better burst of the energy comes out. But Jerry is not there. Hes hanging in. It was like that until he just gave up and we dont get him for most of set 2. I hate to rag on the man. Hes the best guitarist that ever lived. He gave his all every night. He did it for us. And he suffered for it. Hes suffering here. Carpal tunnel.  Drugs for the pain. Vicious cycle. This was a majorly off night. \nAny show no matter how good it is almost always has bad moments and the same rule applies to bad shows. We have some fine moments here towards the later parts of the second set. \nBut to people who feel this is musically a great show wake up and smell the roses. Stop and listen to spring tour same year. The last night at the delta center, the last night at the spectrum , the first night in memphis, tampa. All much better shows than this. Just sayin...",

Taken a year, got themselves together and rested and junk free and found a really good keyboard player, not just the first person on the list they could tolerate, and I'm not talking about Bruce.  Always wonder why they didn't go with Melvin or Merle. Even if Jerry wanted to continue, rest of the band should have put the collective foot down. The scene became less about community and the music and more about a big do-what-you-want drug party. This started with the Touch Heads and you could see it slowly deteriorate starting in about 89 and then it snowballed. The band weren't communicating on or off stage. And Jerry fading away in front of everybody.",
