It's just like settling into a big comfy chair with a great book -- at turns friendly, engrossing, fascinating, and very well detailed -- complex, but the complexity is an organic part of the music. A prelude to the cosmic goodness that was Spring Tour 1990. It will make you want to get in the way-back machine and go on tour...::sigh::\n\nThe Playing and Terrapin are also very well played, albeit a notch below the Scarlet->Fire.

The Ramble was perhaps the most perfect tune I have ever seen live.  The middies in jerrys jam are quintesential '89/'90 stuff.  Hard to poke any holes in Bobby's \"are you ready for startime intro for Senor Lesh.  Everybody say \"Please\" will be pleasabily  psyched.  Most importantly!!!! The Scarlet>Fire was the bomb!  The Church Bells before fire-were merely a warning for Jerry's next wife (while he left the stage for approx 7 minutes during the transition from Scarlet>Fire to most likely partake in  what made the aftermath (i.e. fire-one of the best ever)  IT was very speical.  The show really emphasizes Bobby's brilliance-which I miss so much-new guitar, et. al.  The ball passed around at intermission was pretty stoney too.  Last but not least-after Ramble-Bobby teases the Black Throated Wind, which ironaclly appeared at Landover/Cap Ctr a little less than a month later.....where it all re-began.  One of the beast shows next to: 8/15/87 (my first show)/12/31/89/and most definitely the run at Alpine in '89.",

      "review_text": "This is the show! A show as tranquil as the night sky.\n\nThis show is less a rock concert, more of a meditation.  Likewise, if you want to be entertained, approach it like you're visiting a museum.  The band is warming up for a spring tour with intent to cut a live album, so they are striving for musical perfection.  The result is that there are instances where the moments of magic throw off the singers and distract from the lyrics.\n\nThe various jams of the Scarlet Fire are insane.  One more fantastic than the next.  The opening jam includes a dramatic entrance by Phil.  The jam before the last verse is expansive.  The transitional jam has Jerry backing off and allowing the ensemble to come together.\n\nThe entrance to Fire arrives in stages, with Jerry's leads burried deep in the mix.\n\nThis first Fire jam is about hitting a peak, although the leader is following the bass and drums.\n\nThe second Fire jam is about playing the groove outside the groove, and the whole band slips in and out of the Fire on the Mountain groove effortlessly without losing any coherence.\n\nThe finale is an attempt to accomplish an impossible group-minded exclamation point.  It falls slightly short, but the effort is still A+ in my book.\n\nThe run from Playin' through Lovelight is a bit more sloppy, although there are plenty moments of brilliance sprinkled into every song.\n\nThe Baby Blue is a perfect rendition, with the electric dixieland approach in full swing, and Jerry nails all the verses.\n\n\nOther notables from this show is the incredibly tight first set.  Just follow Phil on bass, and the rest will come into focus.  \n\nSummary, those who diss this show don't get it.  This show is purposefully mellow, and incredible intense.  f you want to sample the musicianship of the evening without losing too much time, listen to Ramble On Rose.  Maybe one of the best ever played.",

      "review_text": "Magical show Just another example of both the quality musicianship of spring tour 90', plus the power of the ultra matrix, and clarity of each instrument in this great recording. The band was resonating with amazing interaction on that night. This is the quintensential mature Dead that we all know and love. The shit with Phil first set is quality (Please Phil!, I don't feel like it) and is a thoughtful set list with no noticeable problems. \nSecond set is where the magic starts. The Scarlet>Fire is full of dark and translucent midi effects. This is it! Phil is on, constantly \"philling\" between Jerry and the drummers thoughtful phrases. Jerry, despite forgetable vocal flubs, this jamming is as quality as anything from the higher-regarded 89' Fall Tour. Brent is not too fucked up and playing in time and harmonizing well. The Playing and Playin' jam reaches an unusually aggressive pace that actually works. Terrapin is quality, but not as impressive as the previous jams. Look to 1990-03-15 for the best Terrapin of at least the year. Even The Lovelight closer reaches more interesting playing than on any of the (imho, inferior Bobby versions of) Lovelights of the kind. Great second set, great show. Hints of great things to come (the whole amazing month of March)",

As close to the sound at this show as I've heard so far and oh yea listen to most of the reviews below they actually describe it pretty well for a change. Phil is a star in this one for sure, premature Lovelite intro out of one of the more perfect Stella's excluded. Check out 6-17-90 to see how that end solo might have gone. Very Kind show.",

There is a few missed chords and lost moments, but nothing bad..just seemingly uninspired and without a whole lot of energy. I admit I hate the way this soundboard is mixed...its distracting.\n\nI listened all the way through...and I didn't find it easy...it was quite boring.",

      "review_text": "Church The 2nd night of the 1990 Mardi Gras run at Oakland Coliseum is the prototype of a Bay Area show- a casual and relaxed and intimate affair with the emphasis on musical exploration, rather than the manic energy of an East Coast show.  This is Church, not some friggin arena rock concert.  The band takes their time, lets the music get quiet and still, and manages to make the music gently sparkle and twinkle while venturing boldly into some nice interesting spaces. \n\nThe tomfoolery in the 1st set shows a band clearly having a grand old time.  Bobby blows Hell in a Bucket, his attempt at mumbling his way through a verse is hilarious and had everyone in the building including the band laughing like donkeys.  Later in the set when the crowd demands Phil, he teases with a 'Not now, I'm not in the mood.' and we get Bobby doing his best James Brown Star Time intro.  I've always loved the way the band starts playing Tom Thumb over Bob's hijinks.\n\nThe 2nd set really is a beauty.  This Scarlet>Fire is just sublime and while nearly the polar opposite of the spectacular version from a few weeks later in Canada, this extended version is just as great.  Very quiet and mellow in places, but as with the whole concert, played with obvious happiness and purpose by the band.  I do specifically remember looking at the Coliseum crowd during the jam between Scarlet and Fire and being really astounded at how quiet and reverent and respectful the crowd was towards this music.  Church.  These are both really nice open, aired-out versions of Playin and Terrapin.  The Stella Blue is exceptionally graceful and pretty.  And listen to Bob during Lovelight, he is still having a really good time...I know a fake Lovelight when I hear one.  Very nice.\n\nI'm going to give this show 4 stars, as I do with quite a number of the 1989-1990 shows.  A casual listen may not reveal this shows many charms, but stay with it.  This is not low energy by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe it isn't the show to put on during your workout.  More a show to enjoy while sitting around taking...medicines.",

      "review_text": "Phil Is Sick This has to be the sickest Scarlet/Fire of the Spring tour. I am a fan of the Canada version later on in March, and I had forgotten about this gem. But today's listen confirms for me how good this show really was. \n\nPHIL IS SICK!!! He totally rules the band during the jam out of Scarlet. Jerry has just the right touch with the midi sounds here--which for me were perhaps a bit over used during this tour. The rest of the band is seriously in the pocket--laid back but pumping out solid grooves in such a classic West Coast style. \n\nCouldn't agree more that the East Coast shows were completely manic, and the West Coast shows just had a cool, relaxed, religious groove. Home Game Advantage!!!\n\n24.5 years later and it feels like I was there yesterday. Only 4 stars because of the missteps in the Bucket, but this S/F is worth 6 at least.",

      "review_text": "The energy was intense I was there. Remembering is bittersweet since this was among Brent's last shows with the Dead.  I remember the crowd as being unwieldly and intense.  The newbie deadheads were starting out their 3rd or 4th year following the Dead.  They were hardly newbies anymore.  They knew the drill.  They weren't there just to hear Touch of Grey.  They knew the older stuff.  The dancing was particularly intense.  The dosed percentage was high, too, or so it seemed.\nIt was a typical show soundwise, with lots of kinks worked out in the first few songs.  Bobby messing up the first song was on brand and got everyone loosened up.  From there on a slow build.  Walkin Blues just smolders.  Listen to the loose drumming on this track.\nI agree with all who talk about how great Scarlet-Fire was and is.  I was not that impressed with the transition.  Seemed clunky, but the individual songs were just out of this world.  The funky groove of Fire On the Mountain was just what the doctor ordered.  I've never been a big fan of I Need a Miracle, but the follow up songs of Stella Blue into Lovelight was magnificent.  \n\nI still miss Brent's voice and this golden nugget of a show is well worth the listen, and will hold up to repeated plays.",
