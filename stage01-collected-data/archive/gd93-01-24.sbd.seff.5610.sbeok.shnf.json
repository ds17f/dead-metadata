Not that it matters but since I saw many folks write reviews about shows just because it was on their birthday, and in some cases, they didn't even go to. I thought I'd mention that, (actually, my birthday is the day before but this is the closest they ever came to it); since it obviously has no bearing on the show itself.\nAnother reason I mention it, and this is just speculation, I wondered why, since they were so tight with Bill Graham, for Bob Weir to claim on 1978-1-8 in San Diego, a show I was at, and if your not familiar with, I highly recommend, that they didn't know it was his birthday apparently until shortly before, he announced that because of this short notice they couldn't get him anything, therefore they, (as he said, or was it really just he), was going to give him a new name, the now infamous \"Uncle Bobo\" that Bill Graham said he didn't really like, but it stuck to some extent, at least in some circles.\nSo I thought if it was true, that that was the first time they'd been around Bill Graham on his birthday, how could that be ? Well, the only thing I could reason is the same reason they never played on my \"real\" birthday, (or even to my knowledge, on my birthday before I first saw them, or far away from me); that is, in general there are few years (very early years, '78 and these final years. (? I have to double check the last two), in which they ever played much in January !\n\n     Augy\n\n     San Diego",

The playing isn't bad, and Jerry's voice sounds great but most of the performance veers toward auto-pilot. Bobby is again prominent in the mix, his guitar tone sounding similar to 12/6/92. Black Peter is definitey the highlight, really heating up in the closing jam. Nothing else in the show really approaches this level.",

      "review_text": "Great time I brought my folks to their first show.  Coltrane was too much for my mom on the way over, and I was a little worried.  Nonetheless, we got to the Coliseum, got in, met my brother and found our seats.  Smoked out the folks (to my amazement), and the lights went down.\n\nFirst set was great.  I tried to tell them that Vince wasn't very good, but my dad praised his playing here.  It's true that Vince played consistently well this evening.  David gans later chose the first set fo a Grateful Dead hour broadcast.  Excellent start to finish.  Great Jack Straw>Sugaree, my favorite opener for years.  Bird Song was great and exploratory, with a bubbly, exploratory climax.  \n\nSecond set was on and off, flat for Playin'>Crazy, and explosive for Samson>He's Gone.  The jam out of He's Gone was cathartic, a step forward from the 12/12/92 Dark Star, with Jerry off stage and the band going for it.  Drums was unmemorable, and space went on forever, eventually leading me to feel that we were all sitting in a giant cultue dish, a bunch of aomebas floating around.\n\nPost drums was at times sloppy, falling a bit off  beat and recovering both in Last time and Sugar mags.  Nonetheless, the Black Peter was balls to the wall.  Awesome performance.\n\nMy Dad complained about being in a haze for the next 2 weeks, and my mom told me that she didn't feel anything.  (Didn't inhale).  Nonetheless, we had a great time, and it was fun sharing my fovorite band with the whole family.  Simpler times.",

It wasn't mind-blowing or anything, but the sound is great, Jerry's voice is mostly together, and it sounds like the band is really gelling. No, it isn't off-the-wall high energy or anything. Except that Black Peter - man that's some nice stuff right there - one of the best Vince-era Black Peters I would say, and a really great version all around. Great 93 show. 1993 is a very underrated year of the Grateful Dead.",

The biggest problem with this show, as with many of these 1993 shows, is that the band is just not listening to each other.  Cases in point - Bob playing all over Jerry's solos in Sugaree, the mess at the beginning of Playing in the Band.  I thought the tail end of He's Gone was very unique and interesting, and Knockin' on Heaven's Door wasn't bad to end it, but otherwise, nothing really worth hearing again.",

Specifically Samson later part of HE'S GONE\nTo be fair I started at set two and skipped the 6 song first set. \nWill the farewell shows in Chicago have to be that great to top the music here? I would say many Furthur shows were better than the Grateful Dead from 93-95. \nDrums starts off good then goes off into the 90's version of Seastones.\nSkipped to Black Peter and yes it is a good version on Garcia's part. Jerry playing some nice riffs. Good Piano from Vince. (Backing vocals kinda weak.)\nThe bottom line is that the Grateful Dead even at this late date where a better bet for your money then anything else going on musically at the time.\nbut for my ear they just were not in the sweet spot anymore so for me it was time to move on. (Jerry band only) \nMy favorite song here was Heaven's Door.",

I think that's a real factor. I'm finding this show quite enjoyable. Garcia's playing is quite nice, and he's singing well too. You know, the boys made plenty of mistakes in 1974, but weren't under such a strong microscope as later years. And yes, you can't compare 93 favorably to 74 under many metrics, but here they were, playing nicely many years later. When the band is made of artists, rather than mere performers, things are going to change over time, and often decline from their peak. ",

Janis's Bird Song can also be applied to our weeping eyes for David. Apparently, Bobby said Croz provided the guitar melody for The Main Ten > Playing in the Band, of course He's Gone and Heaven's Door to wrap it all up. ",
