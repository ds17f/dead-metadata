Pigpen is in fine fine form on Hurts Me Too and a very bluesy Tastebud. I really dig the early versions of Rain and Snow and Rider. Even Silver Threads is treated as something to dance to. Sound is great for something recorded over 30 years ago!\nThis is definately not something for everyone, but it is definately worth checking out!",

I have wondered why this took over 30 years to see the light of day. Anyways, Thanks David Gans! (as it first appeared on a few GDH hours) \n The set list is mighty fine, offering a big array of common songs (for the time) along with a few rarities, and DEEP RARITIES. \nThe covers of BIODTL, Hurts Me Too, Minglewood, Rider, S.O.T.O.T.W., Baby Blue, Good Lovin' (covered at breakneck speed, can't get any faster!) and the rare ones of It's A Sin, Sick & Tired, Silver Threads are quite excellent for a beginning band... and of course, Viola Lee is hot!\n  The orgainals are very intersting, while some show the native hippie outlook, they are totally priceless. Standing On The Corner, You Don't Have To Ask and Cream Puff War are played lot of fun! Then the deep reason to get this show.. the only known live versions of Taste Bud (Come Back Baby) and Mindbender.. yow!\n  All in all, this is a great eye opening experience for a beginning band, well before the legend. It also serves as an excellent peak into that lovely S.F. music scene before the record companies discovered and the runaway flood came. I highly recommended for all!",

Hell, perhaps the poor guy who recorded it only had a lousy dictating tape recorder but he was in the right spot right up front if that was the case. The last show I had downloaded from here was the Ivar show. That show pales in comparison to this Avalon show. I loved Mind Bender and the one I'm listening to now, Cream Puff War. God bless that lone person, that hero who had the patience of a saint and the thoughtfulness of a physics professor to take responsibility and tape this show. This is fabulous.

The sound quality is good for a board of this vintage, although it's a little quirky- Billy and Pigpen are out front in the mix, with Jerry maybe a step down but still very present, Phil a muddy rumble on the bottom end and Weir buried. There's a rowdy-but-right feel to the whole show that ensures you'll never be bored when choosing this one.\n\nHowever, this is also the product of a band that still has a ways to go, and while this super energetic music shows hints of brilliance in some spots, it's also almost unlistenably clumsy and raw in others. While I very much enjoy tapes from this period, I find any asscertation that this stuff is in any way superior to the band's output from later in the 60s or early 70s simply laughable. The basic elements for the GD magic are here but haven't really coalesced yet. It's amazing how much they would improve in the next 18 months.",

It makes one appreciate the fact they were so dedicated to what they were doing, because I don't think anyone could possibly have predicted from the quality of the musicianship back then just how great they would eventually evolve into being. Or at least it sounds that way on this end. Of course, reports that survive from those days indicate that even when they were in these primitive stages, their earliest fans believed in them. As raw and raunchy, unrefined and unskilled as they were, they already had something that was unique and powerful. And, if this is any indicator, what they had was a lot of fun, too.",

Still they put this away until may of 69!  and by then it would grow into a key pigpen song thru europe 72, and once sung by jerry on may 7th 1969.  \n\nLets not go crazy this is not as good as the 70-72 era good lovin's where jerry's guitar was ripe and phil bob billy keith could take this to new places, check out good lovin, from 2/71 at the capitol, or from 8/26/71 or 5/18/72.  \n\nBut this version helps greatly to show the evolution of the sound that emerged in the early 70s, similar growth can be seen in cold rain, minglewood  I know you rider..., a kind of figuring out how to play with relevance and leaving a default mindset behind, a true coming of age. Ill go as far as to say the band figured out which songs had potential before they knew how to extract such magic?",
