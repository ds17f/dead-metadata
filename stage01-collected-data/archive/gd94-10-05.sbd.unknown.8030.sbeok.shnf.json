Well, go ahead and d-load this one.  Here's the thing:  Jerry's voice does NOT sound wiped out, hoarse, or strained at all.  He, in fact, sounds quite good here.  His guitar playing is very focused throughout, save for the middle solo in UJB. (It is made up for in the coda, where he works this crazy melody out on the low strings...)\nSound quality is excellent. Show fits on 2 CD's.\nPlay this one for some jackass who says the Dead \"sucked after '91\" or some such crap",

I've not heard a better show beyond this date and consider this one of the best of the Vince-era shows. Jerry was uncharacteristically focused (I guess his blood sugar was under control) and the aimlessness of his playing that characterizes so many 90s shows is absent. And unlike other shows of this time, it's not a mumblefest, either.\n\nVery good first set. Excellent second set.\n\nThis should be a priority download for anyone looking for decent late shows.\n\nAnd a very nice recording... but an AUD would be nice...",

Eternity is a nice surprise, a sweet and sad performance, very well done, progressive and increasingly jazzy being on the borderline between melodic and abstract/atonal. The second is nothing short of excellent. One traces these great spacejams to Miles Davis avant garde jazz. the whole band is truly inspired (perhaps by Garcias great performance and obviously physical shape in general) and drives the band into the unheard, reminiscent of the great late 60s performances. Garcia staying on stage during Drums section and playing excellent riffs and jams. What more can possibly deadhead ask for? Forget the great Scarlet-Fire jams for a while and listen closely to the second set and the energy this band posesses. This enduring energy is a seldom one for an increasingly weak Garcia of the 90s.\n\nThis show -with the excellent but more traditinally October 1st- is definately a 5 point based on 90s standards.",

Huge soundstage, fantastic body to the instruments, percussion, and voices. The mix is balanced and smooth.  No foggy window here, just clear polished glass or on a true reference system, perhaps, just an open window.\n\nAs for the performance, I casually listened to Set I and found it in-line with the favorable reviews of others offered here.  Having critically listened only to Set II it forms the basis of my review.  \n\nI was shocked to discover a performance this good in '94.  From end to end, the set is a solid beam of masterful artistry.  That the boys hit their gestalt is indubitable.  The tide starts out high with robust, yet focused energy for Playin' and UJB's.  The familiar verses and lines like warm water over your toes.  It will draw you in.  With UJB's jam you'll be afloat when the powerful current changes, the undertow seeks in all but unnoticed. Land is gone now and you are cast into the oceans deep mystery by, certainly, one of the best drum/space sequences played.  By a miracle, you'll find yourself standing on the moon, with Jerry, and the huge heart of his, clear enough to be beside you.  At end of this full spectrum passage its high time to party down with Eskimo.  If you've listened, you've just lived a lifetime, or every lifetime, in roughly an hour and a half.  To an open-minded listener willing to give it it\u2019s due, would not be falsely advertised as psychedelic experience in a nut shell--no chemicals required.

Then I right click it and choose \"Download this song\" from the menu. The little Firefox download manager pops up and downloads the song to the desktop by default.

      "review_text": "Show has a comfortable groove I love Jerry he makes the hair on my arms stand up. Some things in this world are just right. Some things bring you closer to God. Jerry was righteous and an angel spoke through his guitar. No doubt. Lazy River Road! Truck downshifting its load. It is just right every note falls into time like it was written for eternity. Great Philly show!",

They always managed to get it together for Philly. Even towards the end. Yes Jerry had his connections in the city of brotherly love, but whatever.  Much has changed since this night.  Technology is amazing.  Gives me a good feeling just to listen.  Go back to all the good times w/ great friends.  Standing on the Moon.  Worth the price of admission alone.",

      "review_text": "\"standing on the moon\" standing out!! this was a huge show for 94....i`m not afraid to admit that i love late 80s and 90s era Dead...i think when Jerry was on his guitar sounds so good during this time..the 1st set was standard Dead,Lazy River sticks out.but the heat from this show came outta the 2nd set for sure!..the Midnight into Cumberland was just right on.and the transition from Miracle into SOTM was perfect,which led into my favorite SOTM since 93 in LA when branford graced us with a beautiful rendition.overall terrific show at the Spec.",

I'll be honest I dont remember many of them being I was in space back then but giving them a listen years later on this site is just fucken wonderful !!!! Great show ... not a great late 90s show ... just a great show period. Check out Garcia at the 3:54 point of Mighty Quinn, he's diggin down deep !!! Wonderful Stuff. Miss you Jerry. Happy New Year everyone!!! (PS - yes this one deserves a 5 star rating)",

      "review_text": "1st show Ahhhh, my first dead show.  Being that I was 17 and on acid I don't remember many specifics except it was the first drums/space I ever experienced.  Space completely blew my mind.  the archive is great because I can listen and understand that this was a solid show.  I absolutely love being able to listen to the amazing GD of the 70''s and some 80's but 93-95 was my time.  I only made it to ten shows but I feel extremely fortunate to have found the GD before Jerry passed.  The shows I saw at The Spectrum, MSG, RFK, Three Rivers, and The Meadowlands were towards the end and full,of forgotten words and a tired Jerry but I loved every second of being able to take part.  Being 35 with two kids under the age of 5 I can now pass down the gift of the GD to them.  They both already love Franklin's Tower and Shakedown.  \n\nI still see Further and Bobby acoustic whenever they are around and the shows are pretty solid.  Hope they have a few more years left in them...",

Recently moved and during the set-up of the audio gear I eventually got my old Yamaha deck working again and have been listening to a lot of the old cassettes to root out what works and what doesn't; including my old GD Hour tapes.\n\nAnd am I ever glad I did....Grateful you might say...\n\nAnyway, I just finished listening to this about an hour ago at LOUD volume (it's one of the best recordings I have made) and I have to say, the jam into the drums and the beginning of drums is absolutely PSYCHOTIC. But that's the beauty of The Grateful Dead....they are are one of the very few bands/artists that can actually scare the crap out of you aurally and then gently bring you back to earth later on in the journey.\n\nAmazing shit.\n\nAnd so much for the everything post 90-whatever sucks claim--they never heard this apparently.\n\nJerry, like most greats/originalists/explorers (Keith Moon, Hendrix are other examples) always had some issues with consistency--it's just as he aged, his inconsistencies became more consistent, i.e. more and frequent \"off\" nights, like most humans.\n\nThis night most definitely was NOT one of those nights.\n\nAnd on my 36th birthday,\n\nThank you Jerry for giving your all, one last time.\n\nThere isn't enough riches in this world that can compensate you for what you gave all of us willingly throughout your too short career/life.\n\nExcept of course our undying love.\n\nOne last. I also used this tape to \"demo\" my gear on the top (8th) floor of a building once....they heard/felt it on the ground floor lobby!!!!\n\nAnd when the girl came up to ask us to \"attenuate\", she had to admit how good it sounded even at what she termed \"obscenely loud\" volume!!\n\nNow don't get me started on 09/19/70!! \n\nPigpen!!!!",
