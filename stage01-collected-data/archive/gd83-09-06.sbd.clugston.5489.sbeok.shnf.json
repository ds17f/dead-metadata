While not characterized by the raw energy of some the early summer shows (Sunday Greek, SPAC), it features marvelous interplay between band members, which comes through beautifully on this SBD.\n\nThe first set is no slouch, either.  Peggy-O and Birdsong really stand out, but it is the long, jammed out Lazy Lighting-Supplication that makes this set first class.  At around 13 minutes, I think it's the longest one I have on tape, certainly the longest and best one I saw live.\n\nThe show was  great in person, too.  It was a beautiful night, no rain (unlike the previous and subsequent years), and the band and audience both seemed to really be getting off.  I still get chills when I recall that UJB; by the time they got to \"Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice\", the crowd was ecstatic.  One of the most effective versions of that song I can think of.  All three shows were very stong that year, but this show has no weak points, IMHO.\n\nThanks to archive.org for making it available.",

      "review_text": "One of the greatest shows ever Though it has an interesting set list, the first set of this show is not above par. Aside from noteworthy some Garcia work on Peggy-O, and an enjoyable Lazy Lightning and Supplication, the first set is not great. At some poins, such as the wonky version of Dupree's Diamond Blues, the set is even below standard.\n    However, all this changes at the start of the second set. From help on the way all the way to Brokedwoan palace, this set is some of the finest music the Dead have ever played. The mazing vocal work on Help on the way leads way to the incredible jam of Slipknot! From there we go to one of the finest versions of Franklins tower ever. About three quarters of the way through the song the vocals seem to explode with passion.\n    Playin in the band is no less amazing, with such a high energy flow between every element of the band. After this jam, the band goes into about 15 minutes of experimental percussion and bass sounds although to any regular person this would sound like torture, this free-form  ecclectic jam finds its place in the heart of the set, and the heart of every true deadhead. The smooth bass riffs seem to tantalize the ears while the percussion beckons the listener into a surreal zone of music appreciation. When the band finally does launch back into a stable song, it is truly dumbfounding.\n     After this, throwing stones serves as a nice transition piece to Not Fade Away, which is possibly the most riveting version ever. To close off the evning, the Dead give us Brokedown Palace, who's heartfelt harmonies serve as a tender closing to an amazing night of music. \n     All in all, the first set is a fine example of many great \"songs\", wehreas the second set is one of the best examples of the true jam essence of the dead. With some of Lesh's best work at the start, and Garcia and Weir's greatest work towards the end, the band is truly on fire. It is a musical journey to musical heights only the Grateful Dead could lead us to. \n\nHarley Adams\n11/13/04",

All three songs are performed at a high level, JG hits all his notes and the Franklin's just takes off about 1/2 way through and jams hypnotically with Jerry blistering some sick leads as the tune reaches its crescendo.  Playin is true PRIMAL dead, with a 70s length and 80s feel, long jams punctuated by Phil's thumping bass, Brent's ivories and some interesting Weir lines that add tremendously to the tune.  \n\nDrums had not yet fully incorporated the \"beam\" segment and Space wanders into unfamiliar territory as a rare post Space Uncle John's Band stretches out over 10 plus minutes with the band simply refusing to let go of the hook as the crowd cheers lustily.  Playin reprise melts into an early T Stones version with some different lyrics and time signature, which itself is interesting to hear, and the NFA closer.  \n\nWell played start to finish, another way to debunk the notion that the quality of the music slid in the mid 80s.  The source recording is A+ with the only AUD splice occurring toward the end of NFA (no big deal).  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

When they hit that Franklin intro the crowd just jumped...Hell! we were all up already. I flew in from Cincy on Labor day and to my great happiness entered what Wavy called the \"Hotel Colorado\" camped right next to the Asp(which my old friend Billy drove into Katmandu years earlier with the Hogfarm)for 3 days. Nobody for President in 84. How bout the guy with the giant cruise missle on the little pick-up truck. Jeez remember the cold war? The campground was just brilliant; the kind of thing that hippies used to put together before the possibilities of the past were all but forgotten in lieau of rampant consumerism and self indulgence(and I ain't talking about drugs and alcohol). The local restaraunt even had a Little Kings nite, a bit a home for a lad from \"da natty\". Wish I had booked a flight into SLC and done the parkwest/sante fe shows too. Years later I lived in Taos and really regretted not taking the bus to the Downs. How bout the slow groove tempo of UJB? Nice that they didn't let it get away.

The first set is solid with a great Peggy-O, awesome Bird Song and as previously mentioned a stellar Lazy Lightning>Supplication. The second set is where this show really shines! the Slipknot>Franklin's is just exquisite with Jerry riffing like only he could and the Slipknot is just exquisite. The three Help>Slip>Frank's on this tour (Here, Boise and Santa Fe) are some of my favorites ever!!. The Playing is one of the classics, nice and long and jammed out. I love the Space >UJB. As previously mentioned, Jerry starts the UJB intro riff at about 6:50 into the Space Jam and then the band proceeds to weave in and out of Uncle John's Space for over 8 minutes, with the crowd egging them on the whole time, a great example of the interplay between the band and the Heads that epitomized so many great shows and demonstrates the symbiotic relationship between fans and band. When space is over they finally start an epic UJB, more than 12 minutes long, giving you over 20 min of UJB jamming, and it is exquisite throughout, one of the great versions you'll hear. The Throwing Stones is one of the early ones (where the jam was loose and built up to a great climax, before they standardized that particular jam with a Samson & Delilah type jam). I always thought that the subsequent Throwing Stones were a not nearly as good, and of course overplayed. Anyway This is one awesome show and one for the ages.",

The first two songs are strong, but not an immediate clue you're in for a brain-melting show. Then Jerry pulls out a soulful Peggy-O, a great, even spooky vocal performance - and you know things are getting serious. Nice interplay between Brent and Jerry. Soaring guitar lines. A fine, and unexpected mid-set Bucket keeps the intensity going - no silly cowboy songs tonight. Just a platform for Jerry to wail. He's a little low in the mix here, but no complaints. Another surprise - a semi-rare Dupree's. Another clue that Jerry's in fine form (Dire Wolf or High Time can also be good omens here). So far, a non-cliche first set, and great playing. Brent's circus-like keyboard works nicely here.\nThe Bird Song is the main course, of course. Repack the bowl, here we go. Soaring, floating, Monet-like, ever-changing light and shadow. Is 1983 THE year for Bird Song or what? Well, there's 1972, and 1990 with Branford. But listen to this!!\nLike Bach at the organ, Garcia just weaves melody and fugue around and around into a dazzling tapestry of notes. Supplication is fast and furious - showers of sparks from Jerry. So much great jamming in Set One, they set the bar high to top themselves in Set Two. But from the first notes of Help - you know Set Two will be even more spectacular.\nPhil and Jerry blast out of the gate, with an up-tempo Help that demands your body to move. They waste no time in getting to the Slipknot - and the fingers really fly. Jerry burns on the fuzz tone. A long well-jammed version, one of the best from this period. Ties your brain in a knot, indeed!\n13 minute Franklin says it all. And the PLayin - Garcia goes off into space land, with help from Brent's synth. Twisty and mysterious. The Jam into Drums is almost Dark Star territory.\nThen the rare post-Drums Uncle John's is just pure gravy, a long and mythical trip, and the Brokedown is a treat too.\nA must have for 1983 fans and a solid show all the way.\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I'd always assumed most of their 80's shows after '81 and before '89 weren't that great, due to Jerry's condition and such. I was very wrong. I just started listening to shows from 82-83, and so far I'm blown away, especially by this show. The Help>Slipknot>Franklins is up there with the best '77 versions, while the Playing jam is as fluid and tripped-out as anything I've heard from the band. The first set ain't too shabby either, with a killer Peggy-O and, one of my personal favorites, Bird Song, which is stellar even with the AUD patch. \n\nJust a killer show all around. The Dead may have been a little inconsistent in the early 80's, but when they were on, they were ON! I think my collection's gonna grow alot here really soon.",

      "review_text": "Update 9/6/10 i think the help>slip>franklin's from this show is one of the best of the '80s, of what i've heard at least. especially the slipknot, which, dare i say, is better than a few from the '70s.\n\nit actually starts off a little weak, with garcia fumbling his way thru help a bit. you think to yourself \"uh oh, here we go...\" but all bets are off once slipknot starts. the jamming is fast paced and really trippy; jerry and brent dance around each other very creatively. the franklin's is also well done, even if jer forgets a lot of the words. \n\ni also dig the long supplication jam, and the playin' is pretty nice...gonna have to keep this one in the rotation....\n\n************************************************\npretty good show, like the early bucket, and the bird song is really nice, maybe not quite as good as 10/17/83 but close; i'm really reevaluating my opinion of 82-83, which were good years, even if they aren't 1969...\n\nrecommended",

The biggest highlights for me were in the first set: an always fun Dupree's and a fairly epic Supplication jam. The second set a mostly meat-and-potatoes setlist that was very well played and worth hearing. I enjoyed it but didn't love it.",

      "review_text": "Those great nine eighty threes <br />In between a stretch of hot shows  (Boise>Utah>Colorado>Santa Fe). I still remember the drive from Utah because of whom I was with [both quirky cats now not with us], and being amazed up on the high desert interstate to see Heads every 20 miles and at every rest area. The '83 scene was much more insular than '82 or '85 somehow (though the 27000 Red Rocks tix sold were much more than the few thousand at the Utah show). The next night was the big show, but this one is known for the Bird Song, Slipknot! & the Playin'. The whole second set is must-hear-once, but if you are just listening through use the matrix, as it's complete and better pitched.\n\nFirst Set. It's average-to-shaky getting going until a fine <i>Peggy-O</i>, though in <i>Hellina</i> Jer never seems to get hold of the rope 100%. The set then gets more exciting (though the SBD has mix problems and by the time you can hear Jer's guitar, you lose Brent). The beginning of the solid <i>Minglewood</i>  (T right here in Denver) is clipped. The abrupt patch in <i>Bird Song</i> is much better on the MTX (which <u>needs +1% pitch correction</u>). This is one of the best '80s Birds; there's so much here in this one version. Is <i>Supplication</i> the  longest one? A jug bandish <i>Might as Well</i> finishes up a set that's better for Jer than Bobby.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Help on the Way</i> springs out way uptempo and, as you would guess, not the tightest. But good gods this <i>Slipknot!</i> makes up for it. It goes into a jam that covers all the bases, and the bleachers, and the parking lots. Also one of the longest versions, it has to heard to be believed. Jer then muffs half the lyrics in <i>Franklin's</i>, but the playing is dynamic. The set peaks again with <i>Playin'</i>. Also taking off way uptempo, it has a wonderful jam - maybe the tour best [4 in 13 dates]. Brent adds much - this is when he had started using a Yamaha GS1, which you can hear here. It starts a sammich of GOGD, with the rest of the set average '83. Bobby finds a riff late in <i>Space</i> which Jer plays against briefly. The SBD here has a 10min edit @4:55,  but only the clugston_5489 version, because the Seamons uses a complete source. The SBD also has a 15sec cut @0:07 in <i>Uncle John's. Throwing Stones</i> wakes up after a few minutes (come waltz with the stars). The patch in <i>Not Fade</i> is less abrupt in the MTX. The encore is a great version and the Wavy Gravy announcement is classic Dead peripheral bijou.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nBird Song - there's so much here, maybe best '83\nSlipknot! - has to be heard to be believed\nPlaying in the Band - uptempo into  wonderful jam\nBrokedown Palace - crafted\n\nSOURCES: Jer's guitar is faint on much of the 1st set of the SBD. But you can't be choosy here, with one source (it <u>needs -0.5% pitch correction</u> from Help through Drums). However, try the Seamons matrix for Alabama and GSET [at least], until the mix settles out. It's also superior for Bird Song and has the complete Space, complete UJB, NFA, & Wavy Gravy (all missing/cuts on SBD). The 143039_beyerm201 is the best version of the Holbrook AUD.",
