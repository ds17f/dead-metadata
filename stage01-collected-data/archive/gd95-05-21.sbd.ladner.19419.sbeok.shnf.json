After the show, the cops were making us turn right as we exited the parking lot (we needed to turn left).  We drove for about two hours and suddenly we were surrounded by green hills and tall tress (neither in Vegas).  We panicked, so we turned around and were back at the stadium in about five minutes.

There were brief moments when some spark would light, but nothing that would carry through a set or a show, those days were over. Toss into this picture folks who thought they were witnessing a great great rock show and it made it that much more painful.

I drove there in a 1981 jeep with no AC and we camped all three nights; thus I never got to cool off. This show was much better than the first two of the stand, however, was a very poor showing by the boys. The first set was  a complete dud. The drum circle in the middle of the  field during intermission certainly pumped the crowd up... I think the same thing happened during the first show too. The crowd finally got into it during eyes, with the highlight beingthe other one. The crowd mellowed out during Days and never recovered. Liberty was horrible.\n\nLooking back at the show, even though it was barely tollerible, I should have enjoyed it more. I was too worried about money. There are more important things in life.\n\n2 stars out of 5",

A great weekend of fun as Friday was my brothers birthday and Saturday was my best friends and we are all Huge Heads.\n\nThe First set was nice but the second was a real gift! Especially after I got a back stage pass during the break! No I didn't get to hang with the Boys but I still have the pass and it says \"Paid in Full\" .\n\nI believe the second set was smokin start to finish even with Corina which isn't one of my favs and  Liberty which can Quack like a duck-lol.\n\nThe Unbroken was a sign of things to come for my love of P&F's and the Eyes sparkled and shined.\n\nExcuse my long windedness but I wax nostalgic for the Days that Lie between.\n\nThe Other ONE-buscameby",

      "review_text": "last 1 A lot of memories. My last show after 10 years of amazing memories and experiences, truly life-altering times. A poignant night. The last two nights had had a couple of small high points, but it felt like there really wasn't much left with Jerry's health, and musically nothing at stake. I remember the crowd being out of control- a whole different vibe. Everyone selling, wanting something, one guy relentlessly screaming at the crowd in the lot, red in the face  to \"kick down his miracle\". Regardless, I remember coming into this show thinking \"fuck it, after all these guys have done for me and all the love they've given me over the years, I'll be damned if I'm going to leave them when they're low\". I danced my ass off, not many people were (there were a lot of \"tourist\" type show goers there, checking out the \"novelty\" of the Dead). It was hard to keep things going in that first set, but I stuck with it. The second set was different. It was ragged, but beautiful. For me there were a lot of tunes meaningful to my history with the Dead, a lot of \"bookends\". The Unbroken Chain (expected) was nice; thanks Phil and guys. What a beautiful song, it meant a lot. An older-style Eyes was a great next number, reminded me a bit of my 1st show when it really caught my ear. Jerry was there for that. Then it was really great to hear the Spanish Jam- Other One (my favorite tune), really what I always hoped to hear out of space ). Days Between, wow. Jerry had given of his soul for this scene over the years, and had paid for it. What a heavy number, and in the context of his health and the crazy crowd scene, it was breathtaking. Over the years I had watched that slot go from Wharf Rat to Stella to Standing on the Moon, now the swan song. It was sad, and hard. Then Sugar Mags, making the classic out of space 3 Dead songs (Other 1-Jerry soul-Sugar mags) from over the years. \n\nThen it was over. I remember just sitting out by the car, kind of wanting to go to the next place with them, but knowing that it was over, really over. There was a longing, and a peace too. I just kept smoking and feeling the vibe of the night that was flowing out into the desert. I wish we had done better by those guys in the last years, it just got out of control. Thanks Dead, for everything. I still think about you all the time. I was glad to have had such a nice final set with all of you too.\n\nHey, \"sound quality freaks\", this is maybe not what you're looking for as you comb over the reviews for \"quality\" ratings. But this is a nice recording; I'd only heard a muddy one until this point.",

I thought for sure they'd cancel the rest of the tour after seeing these shows. My disappointment in these shows was overshadowed by my concern for Jerry.",

      "review_text": "Vegas Baby I am so glad I made it to Vegas in 1995, after 3 years of planning I finally made it. The parking lot scene and atmosphere surrounding these shows is what made them special. Yes this was a 1995 show and looking (listening) back this will not make anyones best ever list. However for 1995 there were more hits then misses at this show and the Unbroken/Eyes combo was my last great memory of seeing the Dead live. I also think the Drums with Carter Beauford of DMB is worthy of a listen, as well as the cool Spanish Jam/Other One.",

      "review_text": "Wonderful show despite revisionist theory Yes, alot of 1995 was ragged. Yes, some of the shows Jerry was running on fumes. This show however, was NOT one of those. Jerry plays and sings strong, with very few vocal flubs. The \"So Many Roads\" is arguably their best ever, and \"Days Between\" could also be put in that category. We got a rare \"Unbroken Chain\" and \"Spanish Jam\", and we got alot of tight jams in \"The Other One\" and \"Eyes\" among others. Guys and Gals, this show rocked. I've always regretted not seeing more shows after this (like many others this was my last), though in hindsight, I'm glad my last show was such a gem. Compared to many of the nights that followed (nights where jerry mumbled more words than he sang) this was such a gem, and to be quite honest, this one stands up strong even compared to alot of the 70's and 80's shows. It's generally thought unacceptable to compare '95 to the glory years (whether you believe thats 60's, '71, '77, or '87-'93) but the fact remains that this show DOES compare favorably. We have the classics and we have a great mix of solid new tunes. Thanks for the memories, and thanks for making my last show a very memorable one. Jake",

Love these Vegas shows at \"Sam Boyd\" .... for those who remember, some of these shows match the \"tone\" of those recorded at Radio City for the \"For The Faithful\" release .... there was every reason to believe Jerry would get well, despite the extra years. He always had. Complain less, y'all .... enjoy the shows ... say \"Thanks\".",

With that said, what he \"added\" to drumz for this show was embarrassing!  Was he not paying attention to what was going on around him, or does he simply just not \"get it\"?  \n\nOverall, the show is a good show, for 95 standards.  Not great, but definitely worth the listen! (except for the beginning of drumz)  :D",

      "review_text": "Solid show, excellent drums/space I knew if I look long enough in the '95 section if the archive I'd finally find a show that wasn't either a moribund death march, a Jerry free zone, a sloppy mess or a combination of all three. This show is it. MUCH better than the previous shows at the Silver Bowl (which were embarrassingly awful except for drums/space). You know something's wrong when the best thing is drums/space. But this show is allright, everybody is present. I can listen to it without the caveat \"it's really good for '95\". BTW the drums and space segments are fantastic and The Days Between is very nice.",

Much better than the flying marshmallows that melted in peoples' hair the year before! Great venue for the dead... sure it wasn't 1974 or 1977 quality, but I wish I was there now! If you can find fault with the dead in Vegas, you're following the wrong band! Much love haters! We are everywhere!",
