Both of these jams are great, preferring the second, but liking the first jam blues for sure. I know Creator has a Master Plan well, and have seen Pharoah a couple times. He was certainly based on the West Coast after high school. I'd like to hear this version of Creator. On a side note, the last time I saw Pharoah at Blues Alley in DC, he did a version of My Favorite Things for over an hour. It was like he channeled Coltrane and an experience that gives me chills just thinking about it. Another 8 minute song and that was the set. Dead fans would do well to pick up the Alice Coltrane CD, Journey in Satchidananda with Pharoah and Ptah El Daoud. And while you're at it, pick up some Sun Ra.",

Not the Grateful Dead, but the pieces of it, that assemble into the magic of 69 quite quickly with a strength they amass from these shows- all psychedelic muscles moving together in fluid movements of a living sound. Phil has quite strong playing, Jerry progressing in some dizzying way not easily definable but most clearly evident from the way he maneuevers the ever-formed shape (leader or not!). With Jack Cassady the jams are very well solidifed, a strength beyond the Dead... this brings out the infinite way of an ethereal truth- music, the thread of an ever-woven tapestry beyond the musicians who possess that thread. Always is it woven, always is it extended from their instruments... they are brought beyond together in mastery of a most-untamable way of 'art', the extracation of fluid truths of a soul onward into the layers of music building a skyward monument of music. Outerly, within",
