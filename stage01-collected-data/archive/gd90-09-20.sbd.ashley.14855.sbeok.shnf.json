In numerous spots he clearly doesn't know the material at all; it's as if he's never even heard Playin'. That turns out to be sort of a plus, though, as the show isn't as perfunctory and corporate as most of the late era shows. But what do I know? I'm a '69 - '73 fan.\nSound quality is A+++.

It ranks up there as one of the best audience tapes I have ever heard - the music and vocals are all bright and clear and the powerful audience would give even the neophyte listener reason to jump up and boogie.

OK, it wasn't as long as the early shows, and the 1st set song selection after Stranger is kind of lame, but the playing level is mega-hot from beginning to end, and oh, that 2nd set!!\n\nThe sound quality is just about perfect as well.

But this show (9/20/90) is the first one that prompted me to immediately listen to it again from the top.  There are people who consider this the best Dead show of all time.  Well, that's sure a hard assertion to prove.  But this one is top-5 or top-10, easily.  One could argue for it being the best, though: the jams are amazing, the singing is impassioned, and oh man-- that second set...  A real surprise is just how much Vince rips great organ playing throughout Truckin' and China>Rider.  (Vince may have his fans, and his detractors, but he surely shines in this show).  The real highlight, obviously, is that Jerry and Bruce demonstrate amazing interplay.  What a terrific show-- and really quite stunning just for the fact that it came so soon after Brent's untimely passing.  Bottom line: I always wish for a time machine to take me back to a May 1977 Dead show (when I was 6 years old).  But this download makes me think I might want to redial the ol' time machine for September 1990 instead.",

During the MSG Run in 1990, I was fortunate enough to catch 4 out of the 6 shows they played that week. 9/20/90 was easily - the best show of that run - the best show of the year - the best show of the 20 something shows I had seen. I remember the China/Rider that came out of nowhere from Truckin was EPIC. The highlight for me was everything that happened after Drums. The space they played was very quiet. The vibe in the arena was evident. It was something you could sense - that something was about to happen. As they were coming out of space, I started to hear Jerry starting to noodle around it a little bit, a few seconds later, I saw everyone come to agreement and launch into a monumental and historic Dark Star. As all heads know, Dark Star means \"All bets are off!\" This version is a perfect example of that statement. Perhaps it was the infusion of Bruce and Vince, but whatever it was, it was a no-holds-barred exploration into the all the colors of the Dark Star spectrum. It is over 16 years later and I still get chills thinking about this show...\n\nIf anyone has a Soundboard CD of this show, please contact me. I will be happy to compensate you if you can provide me a copy. Thanks...seancanputt@yahoo.com",

I'm not a huge fan of the post Brent days, but there is no way that anyone out there can deny the deep feelings laid into China/Rider in this show.  I don't know where the band summoned the energy from, but you can here it in all of them.  You just know they are referring to Brent in I know you Rider.  It just ende and I have chills as I'm writing this review.  Hornsby's piano is on point, Bob is on another planet and Jerry is, well, Jerry of old in my opinion.  He slams through the final solo after belting out the \"headlight\" verse.  I'm speechless.  I'm still listening to the show, but if you want to hear one hell of an emotional \"Rider\" download this show.  I'm giving it four stars for the time being.  You won't be disappointed.  \"Gonna miss me when I'm gone.\"  Truer words were never spoken.",

Some of the 60's stuff, like the Acid Tests, are all bets off, but in the more structured concert environment, this concert is hard to beat. It has everything. The playing is top notch. Hornsby goes sick and adds a lot. Different styles of course but the first set is totally solid with a unique, interesting set list. The second set is great on paper and even better over  the speakers. Bob sounds like he woke up this morning determined to have the greatest show ever tonight. China>Rider is off the charts. The Post Drums is epic. Even the Throwing Stones is stunning. And the Touch of Gray is a solid, fast, up tempo version which translates to the perfect closer to this monster night of music. Instead of the band coming out and saying \"lets ease out of this with a Baby Blue\" Bob comes out and shreads a Lovelight that tears everything up yet again. Just a great great show.",

I'm a Hornsby fan and I love what he added to the Dead. I think he's a bit tentative in places, but still good (great solo in \"Rider\"). Meanwhile, Vince's cheesy synth patches, which are too high in the mix, almost ruin a few songs for me. But the show is so strong and the playing so inspired throughout that I can overlook it. The \"Truckin > China > Rider\" is amazing. Despite Vince's annoying keys in parts, this really is a great show. Definitely worth a listen.",

Well folks welcome to 9-20-90 which has just rocketed in to my all time top five. There is a two minute segment in China Cat that has to be one of the coolest two minutes of any Dead i've ever heard.

Well, maybe not this good, but get my point?\n\nBut folks, there is a 32 minute suite of Dark Star > Playin' Reprise > Dark Star that is, IMHO, the EPIC version of Dark Star played by the GD after breaking it out in 1989. Add in the typical post drums space & you're talking well over 45 minutes of free-form, out there jamming with almost nary a word spoken - you'd have to go back to 1974 to match that.\nThe transition from the Playin' Reprise back to Dark Star, melting from one back to the other as opposed to the too often used 'stop one, start the other' type, only makes the whole suite seem more like one seamless piece.\n\nTo me, this is MSG stand THE PEAK of the midi-induced revival that led to Jerry coming back to life & the band stretching back out & jamming again (after the pitifully short jams of '87-88). And this show is THE PEAK of that stand.\n\nThis is THE night.\n\nI wish Keyshawn & I weren't just half-heartedly joking & actually got on the train to NYC that afternoon to go to this one - those infants have a way of stopping that spontaneous stuff & we both had a new one at the time. Such is life. Now mine's at - get this - Kenny Chesney as I type this, lol.",

I had never seen anything like it, nor heard any music like it.\n\nI kept on seeing shows until 1994, probably saw 40 in all, but I never saw anything like it again.  I kept going back, hoping to catch the same energy, but it never happened.  I'm not complaining, though; I loved every show and the people I met, the experiences I had, were worth every penny and every moment.  \n\nLove the Dead\nBe kind!",

Unbelievably, 2 of the spectrum shows I received first row center for, and I received floor seats for every show.

I remember who I was with and what we were doing and safe to say I enjoyed myself completely . The  close to home shows that the garden provided  me,the  vibe of the show this night was extra hot. I remember being completely bugged out during drums/ space, into darkstar. 23 years later this stands up as one of my favorite shows of the 100+ shows I had the privilege to have attended. Jerry and the boys were on there game this night. Sublime show. Great New York City energy. Went to wo hop in Chinatown as was our ritual after a show.",
