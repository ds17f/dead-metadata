Very cool!  If you didn't know better, you might think that a second bass was joining him for certain bass chords.  Definitely make sure you're sitting in the middle of the speakers when you listen to this one.",

Incredible inventive playing shows you how good these guys were in all of 1973.   Now can I get a SBD please please if anyone is listening? ",
