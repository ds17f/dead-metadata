The weather was unbelievably hot (how did they manage to schedule all the east coast summer tours with the heat waves?).  If I remember correctly, the Summer 86 stadium shows were abbreviated for the Dylan/Tom Petty sets.  The first Dead set of this show was way short (4 songs) with two mellow Dylan songs (accompanied by Mr D himself).  Sometimes Dylan/Petty opened, and sometimes the Dead opened.  The Dylan/Petty sets were very weak, especially compared to the Dead/Dylan sets of 87.  Anyway, back to the show.  Jerry's playing is quite good considering his physical condition.  Phil is killer on this show - and the Band introductions during Satisfaction is a Hall-of-Fame moment.

Always remember to see your dentist regularly.  But the jam after Jerry left the stage after Terrapin was still great...fine interplay with Wier, Brent and Phil.",

Yes the first day was aweful with the heat and the first time I ever saw Jerry AND Phil wearing shorts.  The second day did cool off quite a bit.  I loved seeing Dylan play Desolation Row with Bobby as I think it was a big thrill for the both of them.  At this time I never heard about the Bobby role-call at the Greek so when he did it here I was completely surprised.  If you listen the The Greek role call youll see we definitely got the better one.  The crowd was screamin when Bobby said \"and over here we have ole' Jer\"  and after a defining guitar rif Jerry comes back and says \"one of my favorite people in the whole wide world Mr Bob Weir!\"  People that are saying this is the only good part of the show may be right but hell you were always lucky just to get one moment.  The same argumet can be made about the 83 St Stephen at the Garden or the Dark Star at the 89 Warlocks shows.  Especially since this was almost the Deads last moment, I see it as a pretty important show.  If anyone wants to listen to another important show, check out the first Black Peter (after near death) that Jerry sang at the New Years Kaiser run later on in this year.  Another single moment from a show I will always remember.",

Sure, you had fun at this show, the boys gave an (always appreciated) effort, and the drugs you took were cool for you.  But, let us not kid ourselves: this one falls somewhere in the basement because it makes for a bad listen.  For example, try Dylan's horrible singing in the first set.  Even Lesh's \"Box of Rain\" can't save this one, as it is mediocre.  Garage band demos sound more professional than this sad load of un-listenable bottom- of- the- archive crud.\n\nThe recording quality is fine for an audience tape and the crowd is having a great time.  However, this one deserves a listen only because it could have become Garcia's last show.  Clearly we were lucky to get almost another decade out of our favorite lead guitarist.  Don't believe me?  Listen to the poor man struggle through \"It Must Have Been the Roses.\"  He was obviously very devoted to even attempt to play in such a condition, but that extra bit of sadness only makes this recording even less easy to hear.",

      "review_text": "Bobs Don't Like Sharing Guitars or Limelight I remember this show vividly, I'd been on the summer tour since The Hubert Humphrey Metrodome and this was supposed to wrap up the Dylan/Dead venture with a nice little bow.  It didn't really deliver.  \n\nListen closely to the first few minutes of Baby Blue and you'll hear some really sour notes.  Dylan was \"struggling\" with technical difficulties on his guitar and gesturing to Weir that something was wrong. Weir nods back stage seemingly suggesting that Dylan go for another guitar, but Dylan would have none of that.  Then in a magnanimous gesture Weir gives his guitar to Dylan and disappears backstage with Dylan's. Now with Weir offstage Dylan steps to the mic at about 3:45 in and belts out his best vocal of the day with just him and Jerry out front.  Weir returns to the stage with a guitar, and about 2 mins left, and promptly retrieves his guitar from Dylan and provides him with the one from the back.  Dylan gives him a look like, \"are you serious?\" meanwhile Phil chimes in at the mic and lays down some heavy notes trying to cover up and keep the whole thing on track. \n\nNow with egos flaring its time for the Bobs to do their duet of Desolation Row.  That turns into a fiasco as Dylan keeps ducking back from the mic and Weir's voice naturally overpowers the lyric. Weir's body language encourages Dylan to step forward but almost every time, at the last second Dylan ducks back.  Weir tries to compensate by singing softer but the whole thing is just unraveling. \n\nIn all fairness it's not the worst version of Desolation Row I've ever heard, a couple of friends and I tried it one night at an after hours party...",
