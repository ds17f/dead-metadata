The absolute best combos of Half Step/Franklin's and Scarlet/Fire, plus many other standout versions (Big River!).

Fire on the Mountain flows nicely enough into Space without the ten minute drum solo. \nI know this might annoy some purists, but frankly, a lot of Bob Weir's songs annoy me, so I will very often try to reduce a show to 80 minutes.\n\nThe sound quality and playing are both very good, and I'm a little surprised (from what I've heard) that this show has not recieved more attention.\nCheers!",

The version is loose, discoey, and just OUT There.  Think back to the first Cassidy and the Do-Do-Do's.  Bobby gets his act together in future shows.  All of Bobby's first couple efforts on songs are a bit on the off side but that's what makes Bobby great.  1-8-78 is a great show for Bobby enthusiasts.",

      "review_text": "1/2 Hr SCARLET->>FIRE !! What a difference a half day makes. After the debacle at Glenn Falls the previous night, this show proved to be an awesome experience. It was my 19th birthday and I was glad to be in Rochester after the previous night.  Unfortunately, while the Greg Kihn Band was ok, ( Pretty much Straight Up Rock & Roll), the Good Rats sucked and when they started throwing rubber rats into the crowd things got ugly with Dead Heads throwing trash back at them. With the cops on top of surrounding buildings spying on the crowd and someone falling off the stands into the parking lot and breaking their back, this show had a real Fear And Loathing atmosphere. The Boys did not disappoint this day, a rather short 2nd set due to the sundown curfew, but some great playing. \nFirst set is solid with great 1/2 step->>Franklin's and FOTD. The LLR is one of my favorite versions ever!!\n\nSecond set is stellar!! The Scarlet->>Fire is long (31 Min) And unique.\n\nHere is a review I found online, I couldn't have put it better:\n\nThe show is chuck full of delights spanning a fine Half Step > Franklin\u2019s opener, to only the fifth rendition of Lost Sailor > Saint Of Circumstance (still in it's formative stages). And the first set burns with the fire that we would come to associate with early 80's first sets in the years soon to follow. But, for me, the crowning jewel is the enormous Scarlet>Fire that opens the second set. Long enough to fill the entire pre-Drums portion of the set, this is an under appreciate version that can stand with the best of them.\n\n\"Scarlet Begonias gets started in a somewhat standard fashion. We are bathed in audience recording perfection as the music pours into us. Brent is slightly out of the mix, but to mention it is to be overly nit-picky. This is one hell of a recording. The song finds its way into its extended jam, satisfying on all levels. Eventually Phil hints at the transition into Fire On The Mountain but Jerry will have none of it. Garcia proceeds to launch into a nearly cosmic level of playing, pushing his only weeks old Doug Irwin \"Tiger\" guitar into the heavens. His tone absolutely shimmers off the tape, and we are left slack-jawed as he drives himself into one amazing phrase after another. It goes on for several long minutes before the band finally does transition into the next song, and the cosmic level of playing only continues from there.\n\nFire On The Mountain \u2013 all 16 minutes of it \u2013 is a 1979 snapshot of the Grateful Dead's evolving essential core magic. Sure, there are folks who proclaim that there is nothing worth their ear after 1974. But this is the sort of performance that even these people would be delighted to hear. The pulsing beat and syncopated rhythms of this Fire On The Mountain display the voice of the band's primal groove in the late 70's. The magic is alive and well, and Garcia wastes no time riding the wave. All of his solos are tinged with something special, but his last efforts goes beyond all expectation. Amidst his inspired and passionate soloing, his exploration of tone via his collection of processing gear pushes his sound into something we might otherwise associate with his midi work ten years later. His guitar's sound pushes completely out of bounds as the world around us is alive in rippling waves and sparkling starlight. We are flashed directly into a singular experience with the music, like some tribal dance reaching its zenith.\"\n\n The space jam is great and the transition to one of the great Wharf Rats is flawless and powerful, as opposed to the slow mellow start that the song usually recieved.The end of the set , while very standard ( Miracle/Bertha/Good Love) Is well played with a lot of enthusiasm. My advice is, dont chop this show up as suggested in a previous review, but get the whole show. It is well worth it!!!! Maybe the download has been upgraded but I found the sound on the download to be good, and I can hear Phil and the drums just fine.",

It was cloudy and there was a frantic effort to put up lights while the band was playing so everyone was hoping... but I guess that bit about the curfew won out.\n\nFolks up in that part of the world were ready for the deadheads and didn't want much to do with them.

We got picked up by a bunch of other Heads going to a party somewhere in the country outside of Rochester.  So, we went along, and at about 2 am, nice and toasty, left the party, having no idea where we were except in some corn field!  We started walking towards the lights at the horizon, and soon got picked up by a couple of heavy metal speed freeks in a souped up Camero, who gave us a ride to the stadeum parking lot.  My friend immediatly dropped, and had to be lead around all night while we stood around makeshift campfires in old oil drums, and joined the percussion jam.  The day of the show was oh so hot, and the highlight, for me, was the jam into Wharf Rat which ahd a kind of manic Frankenstein's lab gone wrong energy, with a musically interesting move into the song itself, rare in the 70's and beyond.

      "review_text": "A long hot day in the sun I started my soph year at Ithaca College by driving up for this show.  (We had opened our first year by driving down to Giants stadium to see the GD when they were on their way to Egypt, and closed it with the Broome County show in May 79).\n\nTo get great position on the field at this GA show,  we decided to drive up the day before and get on the line at the door to get in, which meant sleeping in the parking lot (I guess the expression is \"it seemed like a good idea at the time\").  There were a good number of us (hundreds I think) and it was noisy and humid all night, and at 6 am some idiot started yelling for everyone to wake up.  My sleepless night made it somewhat less enjoyable standing in the direct sun with excessive heat all day.  We may not have wanted to try to storm in at 9 if we knew we'd be waiting for hours in the afternoon for the boys to show up, as their equipment ended up being late. And we had the good rats as an opener, which was annoying and really weird - I thought of them as a Long Island local leathery hard rock outfit, and at other outdoor Dead shows in those days you'd typically see the New Riders or something similar.  At this show the Good Rats threw large rubber rats from the stage as their fans shouted \"rats, rats, rats.\"  \n\nWe did have great position on the field that day though.  During the Dead's first set I stood there with a yellow towel on my head the whole time because I thought I was going to get sunstroke. And at one point it really seemed to me that Jerry was looking at me with my towel and kind of made a face. \n\nIn any event, I enjoyed all of those shows during the Go to Heaven period, in which the return to an all-male lineup and the introduction of Brent, seemed to reinvigorate the boys' mojo.\n\nOne thing I think about now is how there was literally no publicity at all about Brent or the fact that he joined the band, during the earlier part of the year before I first saw him in May.  They just went out on the road with him earlier in 1979 and it was only by word of mouth from tourheads that anyone even knew about him.\n\nAnyway, its great to hear all of the wonderful versions of these shows from a strong timeframe in their history.",

It Was So Loud And Clear At The Show. I Wandered Around In Front Of The Board Trying To Find The Optimum Spot Where It Seemed To Be Coming From, Pressing Down From The Sky. Meandering Through Mic Stands I Was Closing In When A Friendly Taper Stepped Up To Me At About 13:20 Mark And Whispered, \"Sshhhh, Ground Zero. I Nodded Soaking It All In. Afterward Wandering Back To My Friends A Changed Person. Great Show, Great Recording It Captures It All Well.",
