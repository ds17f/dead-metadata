Already half way through listening to it it's clear that the first set was shaky with problems with the sound, Jerry forgetting some lyrics and some unharmonized vocals. You guys have to have a little more objectivity when   you are reviewing these shows. Weather Report Suite was the best I've ever heard played in concert. I like how it transitioned into Stella Blue; that was nice. If it wasn't for the poor sound quality in the beginning I'd give it 4 1/2 but then again it's either four or five. Then I'd stick to four still because of Jerry missing the lyrics on Ramblin' Rose. Still I'm downloading it. Perhaps if I can get some editing software I'd edit out a couple of songs in the beginning. My recomendations for potential downloaders: Download This Puppy!!!",

      "review_text": "Objectivity? Reviews are inherently subjective opinions, not objective, scientific analysis!  Judging a show based on it's sound quality or whether Jerry or Bob forgot some lyrics is just silly.  Nearly every show has a couple of flubbed verses, or even songs....that doesn't mean they're 4 star instead of 5.  If the show rocks, if the set list is hot, and the sound is at least fair....then I can overlook the imperfections.  An analogy would be to look at Michelangelo's David and say \"...too bad his arm got busted...4 stars!\".   Who doesn't have a dusty old 8th gen cassette of some early 70s or 80s show that deserves 5 stars?  The astounding quality of some SBD recordings now available on the archive does not take away from the authenticity of those older recordings.",

However, I have no complaints. In fact, its excellent. the rest of the set is solid.\nI haven't even listened to the second set yet, but judging by the mood the boys were in this evening, I won't be disappointed.\nThe sound is a little crunchy, but considering this show is more than 30 years old, it's not that big of a deal.\ncheers.",

      "review_text": "Early strains of The lyrics for \"Help on the Way\" had not been completed by the first performance on 6/17/75...that version is complete, but instrumental.\n\nLicks that would become the segue between \"Help on the Way\" and \"Slipknot\" appear in a number of jams in '74...turning up in \"Playin\", \"the Other One\", and \"Eyes of the World\".\n\nThis \"Eyes\" has a jam that was typical of the era which has modal movement very similar to \"Slipnot\" but without some of the more developed melodic themes...from about 9:30 to the very distinct melodic statement around 11:00 it is PURE \"Slipknot\". This is followed by a syncopated theme that appears around 12:00 and is repeated a couple times leading to the end of the jam.\n\nI believe this series of themes were originally one continiual flow (probably the result of an improvisation which they then expounded upon in further performances), it would be interesting to find the first \"Eyes\" with this arrangement added at the end of the jam and trace it's development from there. Once the \"Slipknot\" themes started to take on a life of their own, the whole segment was dropped from \"Eyes\".\n\nJerry obviously had those figures in his head for quite a while before figuring out what to do with them.\n\nIt's a neat window into the Dead's creative process...many of the songs on \"Blues for Allah\" were completed instrumentally before the words were finished. On the out-takes for \"Blues for Allah\" included in the \"Beyond Description\" boxed- set there is a tune called \"Hollywood Cantata\" which is \"The Music Never Stopped\" with completely different lyrics! They are absolutely terrible by the way, and have no relation whatsoever to the classic song it became...thank god Bobby didn't settle!",

      "review_text": "Final HCS Til 92... ...and their only version in 1974 according to DeadBase.\n\nOnly reason they dropped this song for 18 years is because they played the heck out of all the times they played it and realized that it was such a great song, as is, that they had gone as far with it as they thought they could. // Sometimes an artist recognizes when they have peaked on something and they just want to preserve it and move on.// \n\nThe 1990's versions of HCS are not nearly so well done. Perhaps it was just too hard a song for Jerry to sing. I mean, you try to sing all those \"Here comes sunshine's\" and feel how you make out -- you'd be so winded from trying to reach all those high notes that you'd thankfully change to a lower key two measures before the resolution. -- Maybe that's what happened to Jerry singing this song.\nWhatever. This version is fabulous. Less the Nun.\n\nOverall, in the first set, perhaps the band is just a bit off in this one. They are sort of sloppy on the first songs (naturally -- that was their usual M.O.) but it was not because they weren't trying. They played as well as they could and, perhaps to compensate for their general unreheasedness, they cut loose on a number of early tunes like Bobby McGee and Sugaree.\n\nWas an audience member on this night trying hard to add to the motion, as well, and I think I did an okay job, but I wasn't atop my game on this night -- probably because I went so \"all out\" on the previous night. Perhaps I burned myself out the night before because I hadn't seen them since November 11th. They were so good in those days that if they were in town you went to every show and to every show did I go. If they would have played 30 nights in a row you/I would have attended.\n\nNonetheless, despite our perceived mutual tirednesses, the band came alive and there sprung suddenly new growth. You could definitely pick up on that vibe in the hall and then... they did their final 70's & 80's version of Here Comes Sunshine -- a version so perfectly shoehorned into the parabola of yesterday running into tomorrow, (literally! it had reached midnight), that it makes you sit back and focus.\n\nNow fully warmed up and redder than glowplugs Jack Straw, Deal, Promised>Bertha>Greatest blast off the flanges and send the spheroid into an orbit of Jerry: Chuck 'n' Surf electric guitar.\nThis stuff is the stuff to which to dance and spin. Heavy Lead.\n\nAshley's Berthatizing spruces Phil up to ionospheric.\n\nJerry's Wolf shows off it's new technical upgrades and you can hear Jerry getting into the wah-wah ala Fire ala get the fork outta hire!\n\nSet 2: An impeccable Row Jimmy. Then the band really kicks in on WRS. The sound is well-proportioned; all instruments are equally presented. They could have put this or a similar recorded version of its era, on the album Wake of the Flood and not had to rack up any expensive studio time. Voila! The essence of Dead. You're alive but you're dead, you're dead but you're alive!\n\nThis presentation reveals an interesting take on Keith and how heavily involved he is on it. He and Bobby mesh to bring out Jerry. When Jerry gets his nod he leaps feet first unto the fray. The mix of Jerry Bobby and Keith's fistfight -- punching back and forth in and out and up and down. Shameless, tooth-extracting!\n\nIt grows into a sweet, sweet, achingly sweet Stella Blue. Jerry's Wolf is licking its chops glistering. Saucy!\n\nThen the band takes a breather. NOT !!! Big River, Ramble On, Me Uncle = Heavy Rock n rolla!\n\nOnce the Dead strike into He's Gone you know you've had it and this is one of those nights when the Dead come alive and without a gulp: right into Truckin' -- a supercharged Dixieland blues Truckin'! Glory Be! Strident electric guitars bebop piano/bass. Heavenly. Strident guitars! Boogie-Woogie! Surf and Turf! AAAAGHHH!\n\nThe crippled man leaping up standing Truckin'!\n\nThe final resolve makes you spin in your place... and ... into an impassioned Drumz. Oops, time to start the grill. Excuse me.\n\nWill you go into the promised land again? or the other land promised...the other one into the eyes?\n\nAn eyes so pleasant and well-entreated that whatsoever falsehood was jabbing at yer beak, it quickly flew off and left no lasting mark.\n\nTotal Deliverance!\n\nand just when you thought of yourself as unworthy!\n\nin surges the Stronger Than Spanish Lysergic Equation: Spanish Jam. Double Total Deliverance!\n\nSaturday Night? Casey Jones? JBG? WBYG?\n\nAll the stops = Gone!\n\nOne of the boy's favorite shows.",

Had to chime in after the last guy brought the rating of this show down for no reason it seems. \n\nAnyway, imo, this whole February Winterland run is exceptional, and I'd put it up there with the November run of the previous year. The songs here just drip with goo, especially Here Comes Sunshine, which I believe is the last great one, as I don't care for the 90's versions as much. Also, this version is performed at a faster clip, making it rather unique.\n\nPhil's bass is very much up front, not unusual for the era, but it's so crystal clear hear, his bombs really will shake the roof if you have decent subwoofers. The Other One here is unreal, probably my favorite post-'72 version.\n\nOh, and you can't beat a late '73/early '74 Eyes. They perform this song so consistently well during this period I almost forgot to mention it. Very laid back, especially compared to the versions that followed in the year. \n\nThe whole show is extremely tight, yet loose at the same time, if that makes any sense. Meaning they are definitely in their adventurous mode here, yet their psychic level is at such a peak in late '73-early '74, that it's amazing how \"on point\" they are at every turn, highway, byway, and back alley they take throughout their jams, and in general during this period. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get every show from Nov. '73 thru February '74. Go ahead and throw in 3/23/74 as well, and see the drastic change in their live sound once the Wall of Sound is introduced.\n\nThis show and 2/22 get somewhat overshadowed by the final night, but that has more to do with the well-circulated, good-quality copies that have existed for two decades than anything else. That and the fact that Dark Star was played. This, imo, is the stronger show, overall. I'll gladly take a definitive Other One over an almost-great Dark Star any day of the week.\n\nGreat job by Mr. Ashley, as always. It's... well...just exactly perfect.",
