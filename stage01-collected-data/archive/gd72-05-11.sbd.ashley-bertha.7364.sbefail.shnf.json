I constantly question my burning desire to collect as much Dead as possible only to be disappointed time and again by performances of questionable quality.  When listening to recordings of shows I've been to, I wonder how I could have managed to sit through so much agonizing noodling and struggles for coherence (much less how Jerry could have managed to remain standing throughout his obviously pained efforts at making it from one tune to the next).\n\nSo, believe me when I say that this show boasts some of the most clearly outstanding reaches into the nether regions of the Dead universe that I have ever heard.  The Dark Star and subsequent jamming here remind me why this band continues to hold the status of legend on this bright blue ball we call earth, and why I continue to plunder through the massive quantity of available Dead archives, spending hundreds of dollars on blank CDs, ever in hopes of finding another show like this.  While there aren't many, there are enough to keep me spinning just a little bit more.",

This one requires your full attention, some special refreshments and a sense of wonder. There are nights when Jerry and the band reach up into an entirely new dimension of improvisation. This is one of those. Even so, the \"Star\" is nearly eclipsed by the extra hot Caution>Who Do You Love, the last ever for dear Pigpen.

Whatever the boys were tapped into during Dark Star, it must have been something beyond scientific explanation and perhaps something that cannot be explained into mere words. After Bill's spirited drum solo, they segue into a jam so cacophonous, atonal and scary that it could potentially traumatize animals when played loud. The boys are possibly painting a picture in sound about a devastating hurricane making landfall and causing complete destruction for anything in its path. After the hurricane dies and loses momentum,  Florida gradually returns to its normal beauty and peace (\"Sugar Magnolia\"). If this explanation sounds stupid in words, then listen to the last half-hour of Dark Star in a darkened room and see if you feel remotely secure.",

Also, totally agree with the earlier reviewer who lauded the strong Black Throated Wind.  \n\nIgnore his wife's screeching if you can. My advice is to replace the Playin' here with a good one from the Brent era.  That way you skip Donna's pathetic wailings and maybe no one will notice when you pop this tape on during your next bong session.  At least you'll be spared the poor sound quality of Playin' and also the sounds of baby seals being slaughtered... or excuse me the sound of Donna's backup \"vocals\".",

If it were not for the crazy Irish SOB I would not have started appreciating the band back in 1970. This show needs more than 5 stars. Phil is playing his ass off for his old bud. Jerry is doing back-up vocals like A man on a mission. Pig is doing organ fills like he means it. Even Keith is on. Bobby's syncopation is exceptional. Billy is like Gene Krupa on ecxtacy(I know I'm a drummer) TOP 5 OFF ALLTIME. It is still a mystery to me why so many people just don't get it. These guys are the repository of American music.

      "review_text": "This Dark Star is an Opus... A monumental performance, this treasure might be the finest show of the entire tour, and includes one of the finest Dark Star performances of all time. \n\nEvery member of the band has brought their A game to Rotterdam, even Pigpen who shines every chance he gets. It's his last chance at Caution, and he makes the most of it, as well as giving a fine effort on Chinatown Shuffle. From the opening moments of the show it becomes apparent that this is going to be special, as the band launches into a dynamite version of Playin' in the Band. Though it only clocks in at 10+ minutes, and it's not as exploratory as the song would get in 1973, it's still a brilliant jazzy rendition as the band twists through the Main Ten theme. Virtually every song is very well played. Sugaree, Morning Dew and Good Lovin' are all fabulous performances. \n\nBut certainly all are eclipsed by a 45+ minute Dark Star which has to be considered an opus. At times it's so beautifully played that you might find yourself forgetting to breathe. It's an ultra jazzy odyssey that you must listen to in a quiet environment with no distractions in order to fully appreciate. \n\nSingularly one of the finest moments in the bands history, this one soars right from the opening notes of the theme. 4:30 in, the band briefly locks in on a choppy riff before breaking down into jazzy space. Eventually Jerry steers the band into a quiet passage which eventually takes on a loose Let It Grow theme, Weir slashing in fills. At the 10 minute mark Jerry begins playing a repetitive scale, initating another extraordinary passage lasting untill the drum break. Right out of the drums Phil and Billy collaborate on a sublime Bird Song themed jam that is all too brief before Jerry joins them and gradually guides the jam back to the Dark Star theme and into the first verse. The eleven minute post verse space jam begins with a brilliant duet between Jerry and Phil before things get atonal, gradually building in intensity. The segment turns incredibly wild as Phil detonates an awesome series of explosions, Jerry continuing his attack. The final 11+ minute movement starts out with a fast paced and ultra jazzy passage before briefly aquiring a Caution type theme, Phil returning with a second bombing run. This is followed by another extremely intense Caution themed passage and screaming guitars. By now I imagine the fire alarms had to be going off at the Civic Hall. The concluding passage is beautifully Dylanesque with Pig's swirling organ and some eerie notes from Jerry, finally segueing into Sugar Magnolia. \n\nStill there is more to come; a second jam suite featuring a blazing hot Caution> Who Do You Love> Truckin'> UJB. Is there a better performance on this tour? (100 pts)",

Pigs in good rollicking form on Next Time You See Me-as good as any from 69-70. But the highlight is an EPIC Dark Star that brings tears to the eyes-one for the ages! The wonderful jam post-DS almost goes into Caution early but veers off into space. After a nice sugar mag- they swing into Caution for real and it swings with rare form.

      "review_text": "The Longest Dark Star... That wasn't... PITB starts us off on the right foot, with a great tone and tempo! The jam maintains the tempo, and Jerry is using a gain heavy wah wah tone that kicks my ass three ways from Wednesday. This is basically as long as one you would find in the power slot in the 80s, and just as intense as you could want. A+ PITB. \nSugaree keeps a good tempo, which is always a plus. Certain songs worry me, but when they are pulled off I love them, Sugaree is near the top of that list. \nMr. Charlie is corny. \nBTW, they take some chances in here. Sometimes it works, sometimes it sounds sloppy, but I appreciate the attempt personally, as a big fan of this song, but a little disturbed by its frequent appearances in this period. \nDeal, solid early effort. \nChinatown Shuffle \nMexicali is fun. \nChina>Rider - China Cat is great, with some Phil bombs strategically placed for emphasis. The transition started off energetic, Bob takes the first steps into Rider, and the rest of the team shifts over slowly, which hurt the momentum. Jerry does a riff that is Riderish/ABB-ish. The vocals are full blown folk harmony. \nHurts Me Too was painful. \nBIODTL \nBEW was fun. \nJack Straw has a great tempo from the start! The playing is technically perfect, and Bob doesn't get overzealous in the vox department. \nBig RR is ripsnorting fun! \nGood Lovin' maintains the nice energy as we work our way through the traditional verses, with some nice Jerry solos in there. The largely slow rap isn't drawn out, but the return to the theme was still welcome. \nCasey Jones caps off the set in typical fashion. \n\nDew opens the second, and the set list variance is again appreciated. I love Dew as a set opener, personally, though it precludes the crashdown to ending a long meat sequence later. Great version on our hands here, with Phil bombs bringing in the first solo around the 5 minute mark! He keeps the enemy's heads low while Jerry strafes the runway. The finale jam is great, though it doesn't crash down, it just stops for Jerry's final \"anywaaaay\"... \nMAMU comes out of the corral bucking and wild. \nStranger has some punctuating work by Keith and Jerry that is nice, but this song just drags on me. \nEl Paso, Jerry is a little lower key than I would like but the song is otherwise well performed with the ups and downs over the hilly landscape we would expect. \nTN Jed, nothing to see here in particular. \nNext Time You See Me \nDark Star>Drums>Dark Star>Sugar Magnolia>Caution>Who Do You Love>Jam>Truckin \nThe fabled Rotterdam Dark Star. It's been YEARS since I attempted to listen to it. So, I'm giving it a fair shot here. Starting off with a nice tempo. The jam turns into a storm as it leaves the main theme around 4:30 in, Phil and Billy pushing the tempo. Keith echoes Jerry, who slowed down the storm, bringing us back to a calm place. After the 6 minute mark we're back closer to the theme but getting quite mellow. In the 8th minute the jam becomes pretty incoherent, but Garcia brings it back together by the 9th, as he builds his way toward what I imagine will be the first verse before the drum solo. Instead the song just falls apart and Billy takes over without the verse. The drums solo goes into a Phil solo, which is short lived, and then a Jerry bit with Phil and Billy barely behind him. The verse follows a lengthy solo around 7 minutes in, and I barely even noticed because I was a bit bored, and then it goes into space. 13 minutes into this second DS track and nothing of interest has really occured, it would best be used as background music for a seance. Then, just as I lost all hope, Jerry starts to pick it up again, and may be headed for a Tiger. We get just that, and just after the 15th minute mark, Tiger still roaring, Phil starts with heavy melancholic bombs. Minutes later we are still in a fully chaotic place with lots of dark energy. Then in the 19th minute we head into somewhat of a Mountain Jam, then Phil messes with Bird Song but no one bites. The momentum slows a bit by the 22nd minute, though you can hear hints of the eventual Caution in there. One could argue the subsequent jam is a Caution themed jam, but as it never officially went into Caution yet that seems to have missed a lot of people's attention. After 27 in Phil clearly tries to go to Truckin, as does Bobby, but the rest of the band isn't taking it. This should not be considered a DS jam session, in my estimation, they did not return for the DS theme/final verse . I refuse to consider this a contiguous Dark Star, and therefore I do not accept its often touted lengthiness. Instead, Bobby realizes that someone has to make a decision, and he goes to his lovely Magnolia, as he was wont to do. He doesn't hold back on the Rock'n'fuckin'Roll here, forceful rendition. Phil stomps at the end, and the boys don't hesitate to bring the train on in for the FINAL Caution they would ever perform. Bobby finally gets his Truckin', to cap off the lengthy meat sequence! Fully energized version! \nUJB \n\nOMSN... for some reason my E72 version was missing this track! \n_______________________________________________ \n\nPerformance Summary \nThe first set is pretty rocking! There are a few stinkers (pigpen) in there, but other than that, a different, fun setlist for the era. The 2nd set, with the \"longest Dark Star\", is not the longest Dark Star... it's a whacked up dark star, sorry. It certainly sandwiches a long jam, and I give it credit for that. There is about 14 minutes of crap after the drums, before things get interesting, to boot. When they get interesting, they get really interesting, and it ends up awesome.",
