      "review_text": "What I missed I just streamed this show while reading reviews since it's one I haven't heard. Somewhere during Eyes Of The World it kicked in that I was again listening to something unique and special. Listen to Bobby's playing. I love what he did with these early Eyes. When I first heard the Eyes from 02/09/73 I loved the way Bobby played because I'd never heard it before. Here's another example of the taseful work Bobby was capable of.\n\nDoes any else notice that only Eyes sounds different? Very reminiscent of my old tape of 02/22/73. Especially in the cymbals. Is it the perfect sound that everyone's bitching is lacking from almost every show here? No. Is it wonderful? Yes. Does it place you in that room in 1973? Definitely. And that's all that matters. \n\nI hate to offend the Phishshits, but my first Dead tape was an unlistenable copy of the acoustic set from Harpur's College 1970. No, not a scratched, second-hand copy of Dick's Picks. This was back in the Dark Ages when people worshipped men in pointy hats and traded something called \"Tape\". And I loved every hissy minute of it. This was more than 20 years ago so it doesn't make me the oldest fart in the bathroom but I bet I'm close.\n\nI know in the digital age we should all expect and yes, demand perfect sound. Otherwise why would we be listening to the Dead or bootlegs for that matter? Or worse yet not spending a hard earned dime downloading it? Why did they even bother playing if they couldn't make a pristine soundboard for us every time? And why can't they sing every note on key and get the words right? For that matter, why waste our time with these lengthy jams when we just want to hear a 3 minute Truckin' and go get some waffles? And GOD, those horrible audience tapes. Why don't they just give us the master soundboards so we don't have to sit through that nightmare?\n\nNo one disrespected their fans more than the Dead. Public rehearsals, flubbed lyrics, twenty minute jams without a bathroom break, the horrors never ceased.\n\nLuckily, we don't have to get off our fat collective ass anymore. No more trekking to the mailbox, just click on an icon and a reasonable facsimile of live music will appear on your computer.\n\nAnd while we're complaining about the lack of digital recorders in 1973, let's just count our blessings that we don't have to interact with real humans anymore without hiding behind a nom-de-plume like  Thor@aol.com or hUnGbEeF@braindead.com.\n\n\nRemember, music is subjective. Just like sex and coffee and beer. Not everyone likes the same thing. But complaining needlessly about something no one can change is childish. If all that's out there is an audience recording, for god's sake don't listen to it. Wait for Dick to spin in his grave and shit out the board master. Or maybe, just maybe, give it a listen. Use those knobs named after a fish and a misspelled 3 base hit and see what's really there. Maybe there's nothing there. Maybe you should stick with jay z and Anne Murray. Or maybe you'll be rewarded with something called music and an experience unknown since that very music was recorded. \n\nOr maybe you should just light up and watch Oprah.",
