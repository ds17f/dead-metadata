This version is fairly short, but pretty, well played and serves as an appetizer for the rest of the show, which is just amazing classic 69 Dead all the way.\nI can't believe I'm raving about yet another Feb 69 show, but it deserves it. Since the end of the month has been, shall we say, disappeared - I can't urge you enough to get this show, the 2 Electric Theater shows, and the 2 Dream Bowl shows. If you weren't lucky enough to procure the 2/27-3/2 run, well then these other Feb shows will almost make up for it.\nAnd just for future reference, here's my Top 5 shows for 1969, two of which I sadly can't rave about because they're not listed now.\n2/28/69\n3/1/69\n4/5/69\n4/21/69 and\n12/30/69.\nThese set the standard for me from which to evaluate other 69 shows. This show can't approach those, but a very solid show. The St. Stephen is tight and energetic, and the Eleven just jumps and wails at a breakneck speed. Phil and the drummers tear the roof off the sucka, and Jerry's guitar is shooting sparks.\nThis was a cassette master, so there is some hiss, and some loss of fidelity, but a very balanced SBD and a full satisfying sound. I'll continue this review at the late show listing.\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I still have copies of that mag! They co-produced a big music fest at Boston University in 1967 and brought in a bunch of San Francisco, etc hippie bands so I met a bunch at once.\nWhen the Dead played the STANLEY THEATRE in dahntahn PGH some years later, I was livin' in a commune on Ellesworth Ave, near Spahr St., across from where I grew up; the DEAD performed at the Stanley(now Heinz Hall) with the AIRPLANE and the VELVET UNDERGROUND, then everyone came to the commune for a big acid party(which issa whole story in itself!). That is the period when I used to trip and walk around Shadyside nude in the daytime.\n It was weird for the Velvets to b on the bill with the love bands but they WERE a sixties band, they came back with the FUGS and someone at the SYRIA MOSQUE not long after that.\nAs far as I remember, Lou only smoked weed and argued with the hippies but I think he enjoyed himself(I think it was all an act!). Jerry and Pigpen sat up on the 3rd floor and played nothing but solid blues songs! U may be suprised to know that Pig was actually a pretty good guitar player!\n O yea Lou told Jerry something like: u fuckin paisleyassedflowerpickers couldn't stand a week of Chelsea!\n\nAnyway, Pig Penn had an aunt living out in Wilkinsburg. The next day Pig Pen found her in the phonebook, and he and I took a cab to Wilkinsburg were I met his aunt.",
