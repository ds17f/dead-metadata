The only reasons I don't give it 5 stars are that the first set is just average for the period and that the recording is lacking in high and low end richness, though it's great to feel like you're in the the auditorium.  \n\nI do question the pedigree of the recording, as it has the open sound of a pre-FM recording. This is NOT a pure SB.  ...which is to say, it's still excellent, though a show like this deserves accurate advertising - especially since it will undoubtedly be downloaded by hordes here.  \n\nENJOY!!!

The first set has a few songs that I don't typically love, but the versions of them were very very good and energetic...except for West L.A., which always stinks.  All in all, this is a great show to have if you like the year 1990.  Sound quality on this is excellent as well.  Didnt quite sound like SBD, but close.  I also met a heroin laden, eye bulging and whacked out Brent in a quiet hallway of the adjoining hotel MINUTES after the show the night before, so it has extra meaning for me.",

I will probably download the AUD copy from here as well.\nIf you're looking for the version to have, back your browser up and point it at the other soundboard source on the screen.\nConsidering this is the first vault (not counting Dicks Picks--83 Hartford is it?) release of Scarlet->Fire I think it's safe to assume that even The Dead are pretty darn proud of this version. Not to discount the other epic pairings starting with Cornell and certainly not ending with 9-4-91.\nAmazing show!",

I was listening to this show through headphones yesterday and heard someone, I think Bobby say dammnit after he missed the first chorus of Truckin. I do think the setlist is a bit deceiving because I don't know about you all but I hear a full on Other One Jam at about the 7:30 mark. I think it should be labeled Truckin>Other One>Drums>Other One. Space which, by the way is a very cohesive jam has the Other One written all over. If this were a pre-retirement show that is how the setlist would read. I had overlooked this show for a long time. I don't know that I would go as far as say it's an all time great show, but It is as good as they come. Check out Brent in the first jam in Truckin. His keyboard has this swirling sound that at one point almost sounds like a Duane Allman style slide guitar lick. This is why I listen to these guys. There is always something new to hear. It is what it is, just exactly perfect.",

I had to drive back from school to my house to go to the show. Picked up some Americian hitch hikers and made them KD at my house. My mother called from work and found out I brought hitch hikers home (and they were from the USA!) so she told me to get them out of the house. It was time to go to the show anyway. I was trilled to see the parking lot scene so close to my house.  Had a blast. The front page of the paper the next day had a picture of 2 of my friends AND the hitch hikers together ! What a coincidence. One of my friends in the photo passed away a fews years back, so it is quite a photo to see.  I was front row at the show. Blown away I was. \nFYI - the Hey Jude mess up was because Jerry broke a string and they had to kill time to fix it. One of the best nights of my life !  Dan",

A great recording and an almost great performance made superior by another Bertha Remaster which brings out the fullness of the bass. \n\nOf particular interest to me is this version of Believe It or Not which is flawless in its subtlety and its grandeur. If you listen to Jerry sing these words you notice a hesitancy in their delivery. I get the impression that he loved the song and the sentiment behind it. It is as if Hunter designed this as statement to the world that Jerry could speak his heart of what he truly felt while in reality he was rather reclusive. Playing and singing is how Jerry showed his family, friends and his fans how much he loved us and while it was difficult to express in real life, the way he sings this song, showing how unsure of himself he was with speaking his innermost thoughts, the heart comes through. I can understand why this song was only performed a handful of times. He's clearly embarrassed with exposing his true self. This song seeks to expose it to us and he's saying he ain't gonna do it. \n\nIf you try to express your heart of love to the world the world throws it back into your face and calls you maudlin and mushy and a wuss.",

The 2nd set opener S>F may be little fast, but it is fantastic. The transition jam is as tight as you will ever hear.  The boys are all dialed in and on it for this combo. Brents vocals in Scarlet and also in Fire are great and then that carried over to his vocal work in Truckin'. I wish they would have tried the full Hey Jude more often. Excluding the vocal flubs it could have been perfect, because the Fantasy>HeyJude reprise is on fire.

In particular, the mix of sound in this recording is just wonderful, the drums hit hard and reverberate beautifully throughout the stadium. Jerry's midi effects work extremely well here.
