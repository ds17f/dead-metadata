I dont think so I would bet anything on this being a Healy Matrix source.\nwhy?\n\nI've listened to A LOT of the schoeps FOBs from this tour, and none of them sound like this.  with this recording you can hear some crowd, but not enough, and not at the \"right times\" when you would expect to hear a few yips and yells and claps around the mics.\nI used to have a schoeps FOB cassette of this night, and you could easily tell it was an AUD source from the crowd reactions, especialy the 2nd  solo in Eyes where Jerry goes to the MIDI Flute.  There was a sweeping \"aaaahhhhh\" that went through the crowd (and my brain) when he hit those first long midi notes.  These types of instant reactions are not present on this recording.  So unless the mics were 20' in the air and really close to the stage, I just dont buy into this as an AUD source of any kind.",

IMO It trumps the healy 24 track > 2 track mixdown source of this show (listed as a sbd. on this site) which as clean as they are sound a tad too  produced.

None of my friends knew who he was. I had to explain it to them even though @ the time I was only familiar w/ his father & brother Wynton's work. this guy is a musical master & his playing complimented everybody else's in spades.
