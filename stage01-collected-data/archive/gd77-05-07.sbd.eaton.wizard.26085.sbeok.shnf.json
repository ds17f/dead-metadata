WATCH OUT ->some of these other dowloads dont have the entire show!! This one dose (oops!) does.\nSomething else to say about this jewel,  the entire show is represented here. There are no skips between the songs when the band was \"getting ready\" for the next song. You hear a little of the crowd screaming in-between songs for them to hurry,but they always took their time.  You can close your eyes and get the real sense that you are there. Listening to this I am confronted with those familiar chords while they were working out the beginning of the next song. Everybody would start guessing on what the next song was going to be and the \"winner\" was the one who figured it out first. What a great time. \n\nMy suggestion, get this, play it without looking at the set list, close your eyes, sit on the floor or stand in front of the stereo, fade back, sway, dance, sing, smile, smile, smile.",

I scored the Betty Board on a Maxell @ Stevens Pass Ski Area one night.  I was a night lift operator--we ran the lifts until 10:00 pm every night......I figured scoring this sweet 2nd set Boston Garden show warranted an early night off from my duties. Called the boss--night was slow--got off work early and headed back to the old Alaskan camper in the overnight lot--one of only two residents in that lot in those days.  Ate a quick dinner and then threw a couple doses on the tongue,grabbed the Walkman and the 213cm Kastle Super G's and hit the slopes about 6:30 pm......Holy Sheep Shit!!!!!  Never mind the fog-marine flow in the Cascades and the night lights and frost crystal maddness!! When that Terrapin came out swingin'---I was peakin and OH MY  GOD!!! WHAT KIND OF ENERGY IS THIS!!??  Big ol' Samson and then I just melted to the SWEETEST, SWEETEST Friend of the Devil---by Estimated I was GONE!!!  Wheel...Wharf...This show will boggle your senses---sorry for the tale but you never can forget the first time...this show is HOLY!!

Bobby walks up to a mike says something about ...\"until its exactly right\".. and Phil plays a loud rif the sound of chords and notes and cymbols and the crowd roars, whistles, guesses and pleads for another song.  10 minutes later  are we closer to a song?

The 1st download (Bertha remaster by Rob Eaton, The Wizard, and Jay Ashley) is the best-sounding version, so download that one.  There is some extra tuning/equipment problems before and after some songs, but that only makes this concert better than all the others.  And believe me, this was \u201cno warm-up\u201d for Barton Hall.  In fact, the Boston Garden and Buffalo Memorial Auditorium book-end shows were the best shows of the 3-night stand, IMHO.

The quality from the Boston Garden show sounds almost, if not as good, IMHO (and it\u2019s not even lossless).\n\nNow for the show\u2026  First of all, forget about the equipment repairs that last several minutes in between some of the songs.  They only helped the perfection of this awesome concert, as well.  When you burn your _vbr.mp3\u2019s to disk, you don\u2019t have to burn the equipment repair fillers, anyway.  The 1st set is as good as any 1st set I\u2019ve heard.  Bertha \u2013 Cassidy \u2013 Deal \u2013 Jack Straw is smokin\u2019!  Peggy-O is definitely a top-3 of all time, and New Minglewood Blue sounds better than the Barton Hall version, without a doubt!\n\nNow we get to Mississippi Half-Step.  Another user stated he thought the best Half-Steps were from \u201980 and \u201981 until he heard this one.  I couldn\u2019t echo that any more!  This Half-Step is without a doubt, the fucking bomb!!  I have \u201cNEVER\u201d heard Garcia\u2019s guitar transcend my mind like it does on this song!  Absolutely, breathtaking!  If anyone can find a better Half-Step, then I\u2019d sure like to know!  It actually reminds me of Jerry\u2019s guitar on the Dark Star from \u201cLive Dead\u201d.  It\u2019s that good, folks!!  Big River, Jed and TMNS round out the 1st set, that just doesn\u2019t let up!\n\nAnd the 2nd set is about as good as I\u2019ve heard for a 2nd set.  Terrapin into Sampson just blows me away!  Friend of the Devil and Estimated Prophet will have you jammin\u2019 no matter what you are doing.  Eyes of the World is very good and Drums is not drawn out, but Eyes is certainly not a top-10.  However, The Wheel leading into a 15-1/2 minute Wharf Rat is ridiculous and one for the ages!  Around and Around is solid, but the U.S. Blues culminates this show into a top-5 show of all time, IMHO.  By the way, Jerry breaks a string before U.S. Blues, but fixes it before the finale.\n\nPeople have commented on the equipment problems during this show.  As far as I\u2019m concerned, it only made this show better because so much tuning was done before most songs that only made the songs sound that much better!  The only minor flaws in this show is a slight \u201cfeedback\u201d at the beginning of Bertha, and Jack Straw only lasted 5 minutes.  But that is me just being picky!  LOL\n\nGo listen to Barton Hall, and then listen to Boston Garden.  If the 5/7 Boston Garden had a version of Scarlet > Fire from the 5/8 Barton Hall show added to the 2nd set, then this Boston Garden show may have been the best show of all-time!  Definitely would have been the best show in 1977.  If they only could have played Good Lovin\u2019 after Bertha before Cassidy!  OMG!!  Can you imagine that??\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",

If you're into Keith grab this, and don't forget 7-18-76, 4-8-72, and 12-10-71 . . . to name just a few. He's alive throughout 71 and 72, and there are other dates too numerous to mention, but on the above boards you can hear him very clearly. \n\nMy only complaint about sound, if we're quibbling, is why all the vocals on these 77 boards sound like they've gone through a couple levels of reverb. They must have switched to a different microphone configuration for the leads (perhaps more than one mic or a mix with a more distant placement?) because the vocal quality, its distance or \"thinness,\" is very different from some of the fat 76 vocals. In any case, 5+ show, still stellar sound. I'll take shows like this anyway I can get them. One of the best of 77, for sure. The other Charlie Miller board is probably your best bet for absolute highest quality.",

This was such an astounding concert from a band who was still just beginning to realize their \"vision.\" I got in early,an hour before concert-time; and for a sound check they played the most beautiful rendition of \"Brokedown Palace\" I've ever heard.The harmonies,especially with Donna's help,were perfect.(Any one have a tape of this?) It was merely a preview of what was to come.We were sitting stage left just slighly above the band,so we could hear the drums&amplifiers before being pumped through the sound system. I think this particular version of \"Mississippi Half-Step\" is the bomb! To see it unfold guided by Jerry's spectacular solo into that powerful crescendo was breath-taking;total improv at its best! 2nd set they played a \"new' song,\"Terrapin Station\"it was amazing to listen as they went through all of the changes/dynamics of this song.\nFriend of the Devil,in this unexpected slow version building to its thunderous climax just blew everybody away!!The band just kept rolling 'em out one after another,the Wheel,Eyes of The World,Estimated Prophet;I think they went far beyond their usual standards,and you could see how much the band was diggin'it!!",

I won't use 5/7/77 as proof, it's not really my favorite show, however I will refer to help/slip/frank from 5/9/77 or 6/9/77, or 2/26/77 swing's terrapin, or the estimated on 5/18/77 or the terrapin from 3/19/77 the bertha from 5/9/77 the peggy-0 from buffalo or 5/5/ new haven, 4/23 fire,  as amazing moments... do you see a trend, he wasn't about being in your face, but what he did do was both fit amazingly with the band, and added sophistication and upper echelon tempo that other bands couldn't touch.  the 6/9/77 frank is probably the best example of the it factor.  \n\nIt is easy to listen to october 1971 or much of later 78 and assume that keith was a light weight, I recognize that some of the chinatown shuffles and you win again's are not earth shattering keyboard examples. But they also were not the important parts of the music.  When you really invest in what made the key material eg, playin's, eyes, us blues, scarlet's not just work but colour outside of the lines, keith was part of that recipe. \n\nlisten to the franklins tower say in 1980 from radio city, or watch it, why doesn't it work, why doesn't it have the magic that seemed to come so easily in the mid 70's  or how about he's gone?   what's missing......     \n\nwhen jerry put the band on hold in 1974 and focused on the jgb, he took keith with him, no other dead keyboardist has gotten that honor.",

      "review_text": "1st show of trilogy, always compared to 2nd <br />Where are those time machines they promised us by 2010 back in 1970? How many people would be hoping for a miracle outside this show? What a show for which to have a Bertha source (let alone an Eaton & a Miller) - first night of The Holy Trilogy. Everybody already knows these are three-in-a row, often-ranked-Top-10 shows; perhaps even the most-regarded 3 back-to-back dates (admit it and go back to your '74s and your '72s). \n\nThe trilogy is weighty due to the fame of the meat in the sandwich: Barton. But there are two other equal/better three-in-a-rows in '77: 12-27>12/30 & 5/19>5/22. Listening to all of these again plus this trilogy slightly lessened my opinion of this show. This is the one (of the three) with the equipment problems that causes large gaps between songs (and therefore the nature of the show changed on the official release, which cuts these gaps). This hurts the flow and therefore the energy compared to Barton and War/Buff. Still, the sequence from <i>Deal</i> to <i>MNS</i> is one of the best in the giant history of the band. There are few equals to this <i>MNS</i>. And there's no better <i>Samson</i> (though there are a dozen that tie) and the sequence through <i>Eyes</i> is also brilliant. \n\nThe trilogy:\n5/7/77 - B+ \u00a0A few more high points; less flowing\n5/8/77 - A- \u00a0Most consistent show; best flow; fewer highest points\n5/9/77 - A- \u00a0Least consistent but biggest high points\n\nNot that ranking these is a necessary exercise -  you have all three, you listen to them annually and apply them as salve for life's ailments. You don't master them, you simply live in the same time/space as them. You cogitate alongside them, ruminate, live inside them, lay on their couches and occasionally dust in their corners. Sometimes you take them out to dinner and they do the same. When you're too baked, they drive. They remind you when it's 4: 19, and they are always up for a road trip.\n\n(Just don't tell them about 5/21/77 & 5/22/77)\n\nFirst Set. It's a tad rough gettin' goin' with <i>Bertha</i>, but <i>Cassidy</i> is better. Though not quite as good as the next night, the set turns on an ace <i>Deal</i>, and after that the set's a monster. Ignoring the tuning gaps, <i>Mississippi</i> is great even if not 5/12 or 5/17, and <i>Big River</i> is a glorious wrangle.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Terrapin</i> is solid - not 4/30, but nice. <i>Samson</i> overcomes drummer soup and most of the rest is just golden. The ensemble playing on <i>Friend of the Devil</i> is great. Donna is good here;  truly one of the year's best. <i>Estimated</i> is perfection, albeit non-exploratory. Note that <i>Eyes</i> is from a dead stop. <i>Wharf Rat</i>  gets better and better, but with the bland <i>Around & Around</i> the steam's gone.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B\nOverall = 4\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nDeal, Peggy-O, Big River, Minglewood Blues, Mississippi Half-step, Music Never Stopped, Samson & Delilah, Friend of the Devil, Estimated Prophet, Eyes of the World\n\nSOURCES. The Bertha (ashley_26361) sounds great, if a bit processed. The miller_88525 is probably truer-to-source, but not as mastered (for balance, etc.) and it's too hot in the bottom end, making Phil thud a bunch (the state of the source SBD). The eaton_wizard_26085 is maybe slightly rougher, but Phil has truer note frequency compared to the boomier Bertha. It's nothing you can't correct for with your EQ. <b>May 1977 Get Shown</b> remasters the EQ problems quite successfully but dispenses all the lengthy equip problems and tunings, changing the character. With a little EQ it's a great live album, if not the show those present heard.\n\nDustTizzle - cuz \"Fennario\" and \"Peggy-O'\" are the lyrics.

      "review_text": "\"THIS PLACE IS THE PITS!\" Your right 'FortWarren'! Right after that burst of static that starts at the 9:19 mark of/after 'Fenario', you can hear Jerry yell out at the 9:22-9:24 mark, \"This place is the pits!\"   LOL! It's so funny the way he says it too.   It really helps to have earbuds in order to hear it since it's off mic. \n     There were a lot of pits that they played in the 70's/80's!!!\n  But the technical problems at this show were awful. Someone in the crowd should have yelled back, \"Your bands equipments the pits!\" :D    That was true as well!\n   I love 72-77, but the boys sure did go low budget on their equipment. Lots of technical issues.  This show is the worst of the lot for technical issues but they sure make up for it in performance. I hate the star rating system. I believe a 1-10 would be more precise. \n  I give this a 4.5  or 9 on a 10 scale. But for the sake of not being a stickler, I'll give it the Full Monty!",

The Dead were actually always at the cutting edge of sound reinforcement technology. The Dead along with some compratriots, (eg. John Meyer & many others), were some of the first in building stage monitors & custom PA systems, (most notably the Wall of Sound). The Dead were the exact opposite of cheap when it came to sound. They spent millions on getting the best gear possible and then often customizing it. As with any brand new cutting edge gear, there are often bugs to work out. But they did indeed care more about sound quality for themselves, and the audience more than virtually any other band.  I HIGHly recommend the Dead Gear book!!! It will give you a deeper appreciation of why some shows have many or long technical delays. Anyway, this is a great recording of a great show!",

It's very emotional in some ways.  I'll never forget standing there in the second deck looking right down on the stage as they played Terrapin Station and thinking what the fuck is this?  I had never heard anything like it in my life and I still haven't.  It stands alone as a masterpiece.",

      "review_text": "miszippi-big river/ wharf rat etc al. This tour was when Misszippi and sugaree became monster vehicles for Garcia. Sugaree expanded from 7-9 minutes to 13 to 18 minute guitar break extravaganza's. Missippi expanded as well with this version up there with Englishtown, winterland in June and a number of other versions from May.Big river was also special at this time and in this show. The 73/74 versions were good but different to the version here and other spring versions.The wharf rat here is pretty monumental. This one is long but long is not neccessarily an indicator of a good version. the guitar break before 'got up and wandered' is where its at (for me) the outro jam is good but there are better ones from late 78 and 79/81. but another good factor is this was really the last tour where kieth was fully engaged playing piano, not electric which lacked sustain, good tibre, color etc. plus he was still mixing in the moog on this misszippi for example. He was still good/great over the summer of 77 with JGB and then the solo Englishtown show where he was playing electric piano(rhodes??) that sounded good sustain etc plus moog on Estimated for example. But when the Fall tour started 3 weeks after englishtown the downward spiral began. Spring 77 was really a special time when ALL cylinders were still clicking. and the recordings were GOOD Fall 77 had some GREAT shows but not on ALL cylinders as keith was deteriorating though still much better than late 78 and those early 79 shows(agh!!)For my taste Kieth's contribtion peaked in 73/74 when he had various sounds, keyboards and grand piano. He was GREAT in those years with the largest variety of sounds and jazzy interplay.Check out numerous versions of Weather report from late 73 until 10/74 when he varied his sound/keyboards and play on all the different versions as an example..Back to spring 77 I like Garcia's sound/tone better in late 77/78 etc but as a whole the band/recordings sound better from the Spring 77. For me a lot of the 'reviews' here are written from the memory of attending the concert as welll which is a whole different 'can of worms.' For example if you were up front at Englishtown(take a step back) you were 'bug eyed' and probably didnt think it was a 'good show' as you or I was too uncomfortable to enjoy it. But I love listening to it now or even a week afterwards as it was a 'radio' show.  Ill finish up by saying that reviewing something as 'the best' is a 'fool's errand.'  It's rare or nonexistant when every guitar break in a song was the 'best one' ever and Phil and Bob and the drummers and the keyboards were also the 'best ever.' In reality you might have top/best portions of a song but other parts are clearly not the best. For example MORNING DEW. You can evaluate Garcia's vocal phrasing/emotion for each verse and then the 1st guitar break and the second break into 'I guess it doesnt matter anyway'.Phil's contribution, Bob's, drummer's etc You NEVER have a version where ALL factor's were 'the BEST EVER.\" There are numerous GREAT versions which are great for different reasons......Im done....for now",

Good Half-Step--- Jerry needed one more \"Across the Rio Grande\" which Phil and Donna provide.\n(It is not helping that my hockey team is getting their butts kicked..Auggghhh...)\nBig River-If you asked me what tune has most surprised you when listening to multiple shows in the archive that did not stand out back in the day to me???\nANSWER----BIG RIVER!!!\nI am amazed how HOT this song was over the years and here is no exception.\nTo me it lost something when it got into double dose Cowboy Rotation in later years.\nEveryone entitled to their opinion but I would say many of the MUSIC's from January 78 are hotter than this?\nDon't know if anyone's noticed but i find shows with huge gaps between songs to be in the POT smoking realm whereas Express train shows seem to me to be more conducive to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds experience.\n\nMissed 1st three songs of 2nd set\nCame back and got SAMSON and Delilah\n(Bobby and ESTIMATED!!!)\nThere is 3 minutes between Estimated and Eyes.\n I wonder how many times that happened???\n1977 seems to be the only year that can come close to 1973 for stellar Eyes of the World. \nTHE WHEEL is so freakin laid back and there is more of Donna here then i have heard most of the night.\nVery nice jam inside the Wheel. around 6 minutes in\n14 minutes of Wharf Rat coming! \nI like the pace of Wharf Rat here it really sinks in when the slow the pace down.\nKeith very nice here with that electric piano.\nOh! Donna at her best with soothing backing vocals.\nIf you can say- \"I know the life I am living's no good...\"\nThen there is hope!

For those of us that are were not born or too young to hear these in their original form, in the collective environment, we have archive.org.\n\nThis particular show is crisp and clear. In my opinion, the band sounds great -- never perfect -- but if you want perfect sound, go to a modern pop concert with pitch control software, advanced choreography, and stage props. This is a rockin show that captures the evolution of some great Dead standards.\n\nFor anyone that thinks it is a pile of unorganized shit, maybe they should tune in to a studio album.",

Just beautiful, everyone is crisp and on point and most amazing of all is the vocals, I think they were at their vocal peak(as far as live goes) on the spring '77 tour. Jerry's voice still young yet starting to show the wisdom of aging, Bob on point and harmonizing well, even Donna sounds good here. Just amazing, my favorite!!!!!",

      "review_text": "Reviews I read the reviews for 3 reasons.\n\n1 - Quality - Reviews tell me the opinions of my fellow Heads about the quality of playing at a particular show as well as the quality of the recording. This gives me an idea about whether I should take 3 hours to listen to a show. That's why I like detailed reviews by people like Mind Wonderin, Doug_The_Dude and many others. Obviously I listen a bit to the stream to see if its a show I want to listen to but these reviews can point me to a particular song or jam to help me decide.\n\n2 - Stories - I really enjoy the stories of experiences heads had at a show I'm listening to. Makes it more real and personable.\n\n3 - Fighting - Who isn't entertained by people arguing about whether a subjective thing can be objectively proven? Who doesn't enjoy reading a review about a 1971 show that starts off with the reviewer saying he hates Pigpen's singing or a review of a 77 show by someone who hates any show after 1973? OK BOOMERS!\n\nAs for this show, IMHO, the playing is typical 1977, i.e. phenomenal, and the sound quality is great. My problem is the lengthy and frequent tuning breaks. Its tough to get into the show when there's minutes of dead air in between songs. If you can get this show with the breaks edited out then its a no-brainer keeper.",

Having first seen them in 76' at the Music Hall, this Garden show marked the start of my early life as a tour head; on and off the road and circuit from 77' until 81' at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. During this span we saw hundreds of shows, and were outside for a number of others due to showing up too late, not getting tickets, etc. After the three nights in 81' Berkeley, my old lady and I moved out to Hawaii so that was our last tour. Funny, we used to lament that we'd already missed the GD at their best because Pig Pen was gone. Now looking -and more importantly-listening back, I realize how extremely fortunate we were to experience this. Shows really felt like family, even tribal affairs, we all took care of each other...Truly. The Dead were still largely in their prime, with Jerry just a bit older, but not unhealthy, and in a new creative and innovative era which produced Wake of the Flood, Blues of Allah and Terrapin. Oh what a time it was! Listening to much their work in the 80's and early 90's is almost painful in comparison but perhaps that's just my nostalgia playing up...",
