Without a break in the tape, the timing of the song would appear correct because after a 5 minute break with no lights, the boyz started off right where they left off before the power turned off. If you weren't at the show you might think that someone just messed up the recording. I remember being completely awe struck how they picked up just the song where they left off without a thought. The sound on this recording is very good, but a few seconds of Masterpiece is cut. You will have to rename some of the songs at the end of the show if you download, just follow the set list provided and the Drums/Space is one track.",

RFK tends to overshadow this gem, but whereas RFK was very spacy and mellow, Raleigh was rockin' and cracklin' with energy. This was only my second show (Greensboro '89 being the first) and boy did they put on a clinic! The Playin' and Playin' Jam are a perfect example of just how far and deep these guys could take a simple musical theme. I was very close and will never forget Jerry just looking at the boiling, stormy skies with an unbelieving grin on his face during the Space > Other One. What a show!",

I remember Steal your Face being my favorite release, and this show seemed to be a double or at least I remember it that way on 14 hi....of unbroken chain. About a third of the way through of Promised Land a lightning bolt hit the back of the stage and knocked most of the power out, I believe Phil was still powered up. A coincidental happening? I tend to say no. Seems like I could never find anything more majical and freeflowing as these summer shows, thank you boys!!!!!",

      "review_text": "the elements ruled the day... my recollection of this sultry day and night in Raleigh starts with a great scene all around.  the heat was on you hard this day, as it was in louisville the few days prior.  I had done a TON of driving that week - atlanta louisville atlanta raleigh yowzaaaaaa. Although there wasn't much asphalt in the big grassy parking lot surrounding the stadium -it was hard as hell to beat the heat.  I remember a fire-hydrant like experience with a strong hose during the day's trippy summer afternoon.\n\nthe show for me that night was quite memorable to say the least.\n  \nthe first set was a bit of a blur, as I spent most of it comtemplating the insanity of assembling with 34,000 or so of my close friends in an open- air stadium (all-metal structure, of course, with 100 foot metal spikes - stadium lights - everywhere you looked ) as the most wicked storm you could dream up was brewing overhead.  the winds the lightning the thunder - no rain to start the set - but it was really scaring the shit outta me. \n\ntowards the middle of the set, I think, the skies just opened up in a deluge - and then the rest of the set was spent getting a ritualistic cleansing with much, much energy being diverted from the music and the band to the hill area at the back of the stadium.  there, serious gate-crashers (who tore down the back chain-link fence even though they had a great view and sound behind the school's property for free anyway), and the law tried to control the hill for about one song.  you will hear the moment when the heads took the hill.\n\nanyway, about half way through a smokin Promised Land the bolt that I'd been fearing arrived - close enough to grind the sound to a halt and to make me piss myself ....\n\nafter a few tenuous minutes, the boys fired it back up and fininshed the damn song ! it was reassuring to say the least.\n\nI was sitting in the side bleachers Jerry side and pretty much side stage.  right before the end of the set break, the rains let up and the storm blew past.  just then, a juggler a few rows down from where I was sitting started this amazing run and soon the energy of the entire area was becoming focused into the one space.  the crowd really started to feel it and soon it seemed that about half the front part of the stadium was cheering this guy on.  and then BAM - the band walks out and we all start out on this amazing set of music.\n\ni don't remember much of the specifics except to tell you all that Mickey and Billy made it rain again during their jam.  it was crazy.\n\nWhen I finally made it back to my apartment in Atlanta the next evening, a storm of similar intensity arrived at my doorstep to remind me of the amazing adventure of the night before.  a stray kitten also arrived on my doorstep that same night - and he immediately became my housemate for the next 7 years. and yes, I named him Raleigh.\n\nthanks for this place to share my appreciation of the trip !",

      "review_text": "enjoying the ride -- sliding down the hill I was on the grassy slope at the end of the stadium (opposite end from stage)during the show.\n\nWhat really happened up there began with the rain slicking up the grass on the slope.  A bunch of people were taking running starts and then dropping and sliding down the wet grass.  \n\nGood fun.  \n\nThen, all of a sudden, a bunch of people ran and slid down the slope on one side, jumped over the wall and made it onto the field before the cops doing security could react.\n\nI was way across on the other side of the slope when it began, and as soon as I realized people were overwhelming security and making it onto the field, I ran over, got a good running start and launched myself into a really good long slide dwon the hill.\n\nSad to say, my slide ended with me coming to a stop right at the feet of a state trooper (actually bumping into his feet with mine)- one of many cops who rushed to make a cop barrier across the bottom of the slope, effectively ending the rush.  I looked up at him, grinned, winked and suggested he step aside for a second and let me \"slide\"..., but he wasn't having any of that!  I did make him laugh, though.  \n\nIt was a great show, but the heat sucked.  \n\nBecause of the constraints of the venue (Carter-Finley won't even let you bring in a freaking water bottle!) and the heat, I stayed outside for\nall of Hornsby's show.  That way, I could hang out in shade, drink beer, smoke ;-), and miss the blazing midday heat.  \n\nOne of the really trippy aspects of this show was Mother Nature's collaboration on Drums and TO1.\nRumbles of thunder and flashes of lightning as the storm passed over seemed to almost perfectly mesh ...hmm, mesh with Lesh?  Well, it meshed with my head :)!!!  \n\nFunny how some really good shows involve getting wet and muddy.  This one sure did.  I enjoyed it, even if I didn't make it over the wall.  \n\nNowadays, the grassy slope is gone, replaced by seating.  Too bad.  It was nice to lay back on the slope.\n\nI wonder if anyone else who was doing the slip'n'slide that night has posted to this comments section, or will?  \n\nBy the way, the people who rushed the field were not gatecrashers.  They were ticketholders like me.  Seating/tickets for the show were field and grandstand, and field tickets sold out way before grandstand.\n\nWho cares, anyway?  Not me!  Anyway, I almost made it, and I've got to say sliding into the feet of a cop and making him laugh about it was high fun indeed!  And, I enjoyed the show quite nicely up there on the good old grassy slope.\n\nPeace,\nTim O'Leary",

      "review_text": "The Real Deal Many of the other reviewers have done a great job describing this show.  The HOT, hot afternoon transitioning into a Carolina thunderstorm filled evening.  The scary/awesome way that the thunder and lighting collaborated with the music a few times.  Hmm, was it an accident or were the Dead and and nature in-synch?\n\nI vote for the latter.  Very groove heavy second set.  Bill and Mickey were locked in tight and Jerry was obviously having a great time.\n\nBUT, I have to straighten something out, once and for all.  The storming of the hill situation.\nI had a great vantage point in the upper deck (until we went and joined the fun on the hill itself) and saw everything.\n\nHere goes, NC State had decided that they were not going to allow people to sit on the grass.  Why?  Dont know.  They had a half dozen or so state troopers and a lot of police tape closing off the hill at the top of the slope where it meets the concourse.  All that comfy grass with great sight lines and a superior sound mix was empty.\n\nA few brave souls began to run under the tape and were quickly hauled off by the cops.  Other people began to gather around the lip to watch the fun and try their luck.  The police were in all honesty, just doing their jobs, there were not beat downs going on.  After about 30 minutes of mini solo skirmishes and lots of running around, a large group gathered and ran/slide down the now wet grass together.\n\nToo many to stop!!!  The stadium roared its approval, you can hear it on the tape.  The people had won a small victory over silly rules.  It was a truly great Deadhead moment. \n\n A mud slide then formed down one side of the hill that the most energetic kids used as a slip-in-slide. A few did slide right on past the troopers that had relocated to the bottom wall around the field. But that was quickly stopped and most people just played.  My girlfriend and I and the friends we came with moved down to the hill and joined the happy folks who had done the dirty work. \n\nThere were NO GATE CRASHERS.  Carter Finley is a stout football stadium with good security around the perimeter.  The people who stormed the hill had tix.  There was none of that bad vibe stuff going around that day.  It was just a good natured contest between those who wanted to sit on a nice, cool grassy slope and those that had been told not to allow it.\n\nAll in all, a great show and a fun experience.  The band, the weather and the crowd all working together!!!\n\nAhh, the good ole days.",

Shocked, Brian, my friend sitting with me, came barreling down after me. We were thrilled to see the hord that followed once we jumped the fence. FREEDOM to dance!!!

I remember thinking at the time that the people in charge had stopped the show because of the field crashers. My favorite moment was when the security guys gang tackled one of the mindless pricks who made a run for the field. The overall measure of a good show experience does'nt include on edge state troopers with one hand on their night sticks wondering if they need to call for back-up to keep sheep from responding in a herd mentality.  My bro and his girlfriend had a healthy headful prior to showtime and were in the upper level first row trying to keep it together with lightning bolts hitting very close. He said they were both holding on to the metal railing for a while before he noticed that as far as he could see in either direction they were the only ones holding on to the metal railing.....just then the lightbulb in the brain flashed....metal, lightning, highest point in the area, bad idea.....let go and back away slowly.....Bruce and the range opened this night and hornsby sat in with the dead on  squeeze box for a good portion of the show. During space on this tour they were projecting some sort of twisted, shrieking, tortured, puppet? on the stage screens and one of the two straight mom-types beside us told her friend that it was terrifying......hard to argue.",

O.K. the show- 1st I recomend a GOOD audience version. It gives a better feel for what all was happening. Straw, good Loser. Things started to get weird during Friend of the Devil. One of the first hill sliders slid down and a cop bulldoged him to the ground. Bummer. Then during Masterpiece, the floodgates open and hundreds start to slide down. You hear it really well in the aud. recording. Masterpiece went perfect with the sight of all these Heads tumbling and sliding down the hill. One of my favorite memories of Dead shows. I never saw anyone crash the gate. Next, during Birdsong LOUD lightining claps that seem to also go with the music! Again, you can't hear it on the soundboard. So, they go into Promised Land- and the power just dies! At this point, I'm thinking the cops pulled the plug on 'em because maybe they thought things were getting out of hand. The band comes back and finishes the song. End of 1st set. 2nd set- Iko starts and we are dancing and the vibe is happy, etc., then it's like the band said, \"We will give you WEIRD!\" Playin'> UJB> Playin'> Drums> Space> Jam> Other 1. I was melting, hanging in there like a loose tooth! A soothing Stella, NFA. I got my happy face back on. Brokedown Palace had never been more appropriate. Alot of fun, but STRANGE, man!

The energy, the attitude, the show, the lightning, and of course the dead not even missing a beat when the power blew. Still amazing after all these years.

Bruce Hornsby warmed up, but the heat did me and my friends in, and we were unable to muster more that a faint cheer for him.  The crowd around me, perched on the Jerry side, had a full view of both the thunderheads boiling over top and the hillside cop/deadhead scramble during the first set.  The vibe around me was full of bad nervous energy.  Once the Deadheads took possesion of the hillside slope and the storm blew through, things mellowed out.  The most memorable sound I heard that evening was not from the band, however.  It was the sound of 50,000 people going \"Awww??!!\"  when the sound cut out in the middle of Promised land.  Iko was nothing more than tentative, a shuffle to get things going.  After that, significant weirdness both from the stage and the crowd.   Neither a stellar nor a bummer show,  this is just another day on the job for the Boys.  Post drumspace, it was pretty much rote.  Even Brokedown Palace's \"Fare thee well, I love you more than words can tell\" seemed to have a sarcastic ring to it, and the end of the show had a prefunctory air. The welcome mat at Carter-Finley got wore out, and to my recollection the Dead were never able to play there again.  I love the Dead, and am forever grateful for all the shows I saw, but this particular one was no jewel, and for me it foreshadowed all the trouble that lay ahead, where the greatest band in the world had trouble finding venues that would have them.",

Security actually brought him back up and they found me, and asked me to please try and keep my friend from going down the hill. We all know how that worked out. They took him to the first aid tent after his second trip down the hill. To my surprise, the state trooper released him to me 15 minutes later after they got him re-hydrated, just in time for the power failure. I could barely even speak to the police at that point. \n\nBeing from NC, and knowing the troopers reputation back then, this could have been a lot worse. \n\nMy friend appeared with a friend of a friend's attorney in front of a judge a few months later for the trespassing citation he received. The judge dropped it because him and the attorney were at the show together. Unbelievable!\n\nI think that whole thing was a lot more innocent than what started happening a few years later (Deer Creek, DC etc.)  \n\nThe fire department was a big help with temporary showers and fire hoses to cool us off.\n\nHaving been to dozens of shows after that, Carter-Finley was one of my craziest experiences.

      "review_text": "Good show from a difficult tour I remember this show specifically out of a difficult tour (see below) This was a great show, and I\u2019ll never forget sitting up in the stands of the stadium in a spot with good sound, watching a heck of a summer thunderstorm building and approaching us from behind the band.  It was there without hitting us for quite a while, with tremendous amounts of lightning effects backing up the band.  A good bit before the rain hit us (I can\u2019t remember if the rain ever did actually make it to us,) a huge strike in the distance blew out local power momentarily during Promised Land.  A bunch of us could actually see the strike off in the distance, then see and hear as a series of 4 or 5 power transformers blew up with a flash followed seconds later by a bang.  They kept coming closer until they reached our area.  The noise made by the sound system when the power blew was incredible \u2013 I guess it took a few seconds for all the amp capacitors to discharge, but whatever, it sounded like a mixture of beautiful music and the dying wail of some enormous beast \u2013 it really blew our minds, no pun intended.  The electricity in the air both before and after that was palpable, and the band & audience both picked up on it and created a very enjoyable show.\n.\nAs for the 1990 summer tour, we called it the \"BLUR TOUR '90\" - one show per city, one day off, and one show in another city FAR AWAY.  It almost seemed that the rumors that the band was trying to discourage touring were true \u2013 at least for that summer.  Here\u2019s the tour schedule: (Do YOU think this was KIND?)\n7/4 Bonner Springs Kansas ->\n7/5 Drive -> \n7/6 Louisville KY -> \n7/7 Drive -> \n7/8 Pittsburgh PA-> \n7/9 Drive\n7/10 Raleigh NC-> \n7/11 Drive ->\n7/12 Washington D.C. -> \n7/13 Drive Really Far -> \n7/14Foxboro Mass. -> \n7/15 Drive\n7/16 Buffalo NY -> \n7/17 Drive -> \n7/18&19 @ Deer Creek, IN (Finally, 2 SHOWS in one venue!) REST!!!!\n7/21-22-23 Chicago, IL. \n\nThe 23rd was, sorrowfully, the last time we saw the incredibly soulful and talented Brent Mydland before his departure from this particular station.  I remember noticing something up with Brent throughout that tour, at least 5 times I was near the backstage fence when a helicopter came in to bring in a Band member, and every time it was Brent, carrying a briefcase and looking like he was somehow \u2018out of phase\u2019 with everyone & everything around him.  A number of my friends commented on the songs he was breaking out and wondered what was up, there were a lot of roumors - but there always are. I pray his journey onward took him to a beautiful, joyful place\n\nI was the only one in the car with a valid driver\u2019s license, so I had to do nearly all of the driving.  Many paper cartoon Woodstocks to keep me going.  By the time we made Foxboro, I\u2019d had enough driving, so I took a few Xanax, laid down in the back seat, and told the others to wake me up in Buffalo.",

A guy was handing out wet paper towels from a cooler filled with Ice water to cool us down.   We walked around the carnival of sights and sounds( and smells).  We took a tour of a double decker \"hippie\" bus, saw friends, laughed and entered the stadium while Bruce Hornsby played.  The greatful Dead started, and we were flying by this time.  A rain storm was brewing on the horrizon and a beautiful thunderstorm rolled in and cooled off the crowd.  I asked a girl if the Dead was going to cancel for the rain and she assured me that they would play on.  There was an interlude and the Dead came back on stage.  I remember that the lightning show and thunder matched the music as if god himself was tapping his foot to the music.  There was a big grassy hill behind the field seats and the stadium seats and one guy was filled with the spirit and jumped the fence.  The stadium was cheering for him, but he was tackled by a few highway patrolmen.  The whole stadium booed.  He broke free again and started to run with his arms in the air, fueled by the crowds wild cheers, but alas was caught again with more boo's from the onlookers.  A couple of more revelers were inspired and jumped the fence, then three, then a dozen then hundreds rushed the field.  My friend grabbed me and said \" lets go\", we ran to the grassy hill and slipped and slid on the wet grass, and danced like possessed banshees.  The feeling was electric.  I remember when ( so we thought) the final song played; Not Fade Away, and we started walking out while continuing to sing \" know our love will not fade away\" clapping with all of our hearts with thousand of others and the song went on forever.  We sang it on and on even in the parking lot as one big group, on and on and on.  I went to many shows afterward, but will never forget the vibe, the celebration and the joy.  And to this very day my love has not faded away.  Rest in peace Jerry and thank you for a fine afternoon",
