I have to give credit to Phil for dropping some mad bass lins during \" Terrapin Station \", \" Est. Prophet \", and \" The Deal\", on set one. It is a first Terrapin and Estimatd. I`m really stuck on set one, just cause of the set list is great. Check out Phil cause he was on fire the whole show. Jerry does a great solo on \" The Deal\". One more highlight is Samson and Delilah. Get the show for the Terrapin, Est. Prohpeht, Band>Wheel>Band, Deal and S nd D.",

Garcia seems willing to explore much more in the first solo and in the little jam between Lady With a Fan/Terrapin Station. He must've been trying things out before he settled on his standard riffs that you get in all the great May 77 versions. Some might not like it: It's not quite as smooth, the guitars have more of an edge, and Keith seems to be trying out some stuff also, but I find it refreshing to hear something a little different from the same old great versions of Terrapin.",

Damn, that would be sweet to see these two tunes played for the first time, especially Terrapin... at least we can listen to played for the first time 30 years later... The rest of the show is awesome, too. I like the Minglewood Blues, with a cool little intro(albeit one that lasts about 5 seconds). Good first set. Second set is sweet too. The H>S>FT is good, but I would much prefer any from May/June/Oct. of this same year. The real treat is the Eyes>Dancin', where, as previously mentioned, Phil does some sweet stuff with the bass, and Keith makes the transition perfect. Nice U.S. Blues encore, and the filler is good too. The first Scarlet>Fire I've heard that rivals the Cornell one, but still falls a wee-bit short. All in all, download this show.",

Now I'm a big Estimated fan and this is Number 1 or 2 (8-12-79). I wish Jerry's solo would have been longer, but Keith tripping out on the keys is what makes this one so special.\n\n\nPhil is nuts on the Help>Slip>Frank. And I'm not that big a fan of the later Dancin's, but this is my second favorite version behind 6-14-76. \n\nFinally, U.S. Blues is the way to end a show like this, not the way they ended Cornell. \n\nI just came off a road trip. I listened to this show and 5-8 back to back. And afterward I couldn't believe there was even a comparison. \n\nOops forgot the perfect Terrapin opener! Now my thoughts on this song are that it only got worse over time because it really didn't lend itself to improv as much. Jerry just got sloppy over the years, but this is absolutely perfect and it's the icing on the cake.\n\nNO! the real icing is the perfect sound quality of this download!\n\nBottom Line: Number 1 download in my book.

I pull it out more often than alot of other 77 stuff. This is obviously coming the heels of a very high time everyone from the band to the fans knew this was a peek and good times for the music and scene. Talk about family and old school and all that kind shit this was it.  After month of May the band got about a week off and played a show at the Forum in LA. Then a 3 night run was booked at the Winterland. Those shows are the culmination of the previous month the new songs, old bust outs  and the high groove they were on. Thats so sick, The bands having a blast fans are are going bonkers and there returning home to the Winterland to show its fans whats been going down and they crush it.

You can tell that this first Terrapin is a little rough, but I amazed on how beautiful it really is.  They had already spent a lot of time working on it, so that doesn't surprise me, per se, but usually in such situations, first time played isn't a comment on the old setlist that I jump for joy when I see.  This show is a goodie.\n\nAnd btw, if you would like to DL the _vbr.mp3 files for any streaming show, you can do as another reviewer mentioned, or if you use Firefox, right click the m3u file when it downloads in the download manager, select properties and get the specific FTP server address.

This one does have eyes.  Take a full listen to the Help on the Way/Slipknot/Franklin's Tower medley as well.  Jerry plays one hell of a sick lead during Help on the Way.  That is all.",

      "review_text": "Top 5! Now it's my attempt to write a review like Dr. Flashback, as they say imitation is the highest form of flattery.\n\nThe boys leave nothing in their trucks when they step on stage at Swing.  Jerry immediately pulls out  his new song Terrapin Station.  Much to the delight of the crowd but they have no idea what was played!  But they loved it.  Bobby gets behind his Minglewood Blues for a shaker that you'll love.  But the premier song of this entire show is number 4 in the lineup.  Bobby wrote a song with rhythmic trippy sounds. Wow...what a great song and what a great name!  Folks I must declare that in this case, the  best version of Estimated was the first ever played.  Mickey has a skippy symbol beat that isn't found in future versions, and Phil puts down some loud bass notes during the chorus to give this song some depth.\n********* Bong Break *********\nWow couldn't even get through the first 4 songs without needing to take a break, a refresher.  Now that I'm on my way to seeing the prophet himself, I must opine the greatness of the ending of the first set.  Playin > Wheel > Playin is simply masterful.  For those of you who like the break-neck 1972 Playin' jams, the 1973 jazzy-intermediate Playin' jams, and 1974 mostly jazzy Playin jams, you get a huge dose of trippy Garcia wah wah sounds on this!  This is a magical   Playin' because the boys actually do coalesce into a furious epileptic seizure 2/3 of the way through.  The wheel and the Playin' reprise is brilliant way to end the first set.\nThings only get better in the second set.  Samson and Jed get our taste buds primed after the intermission, and Garcia gets a hole-in-one with The Music Never Stopped.  But how does the band play Help > Slip > Franklin so well after such a long break?  Slipknot is especially teasing and really fulfills the empty space in your head from all the pot you just smoked.  \nBut wait, the gig is not nearly over - Eyes of the World is just as solid as a steel bar.  Garcia flies like a butterfly in the beginning notes, the song is not played too slow nor too fast (some 1977 versions Eyes are too fast in my opinion) and Phil allows us to melt into Dancin' like butter in a microwave.  They pull out Around to get you dancin' and then send us all home with US Blues.\nThis is most definitely Top 5, and frankly I would not hesitate to put this #1 for the year.  I've listened to Eyes of The World only about 85 times it's so good.  Just for the record my Top 5 for this year includes\n2/26\n5/8\n5/25\n6/9\n10/02\nwith serious honorable mentions to\n3/19\n4/23\n11/6\nDr. Steve Garcia :)",

      "review_text": "Only show with no drums and Jerry into a Moog I ever saw! Also, this is the only time I ever saw Phil do a distinct bass solo; during \"Eyes of the World\", of course. Those of you who saw them in '73-'74 may have, but after this, he pretty much stopped that. This is my third show, and believe it or not I actually think this was the weakest of my amazing first four, i.e. that's how great the other three were in my opinion! The best of these I think was the fourth one, namely at The Forum 1977/6/4 i.e. just prior to the more well known Winterland shows in June. The other two being the second of each of following the pairs: with \"The Who\" at Oakland Stadium 1976/10/10 and at L.A.'s Shrine Auditorium 1976/10/15!\n     The Swing was a strangely built building for a concert! (By the way it no longer exists because apparently a plane crashed into it after E.L.P., being the last band to play there shortly after Grateful Dead played there in Dec. '80; (which was also a great show, and the only one I ever passed out at, but that's another story)! (What the hell does E.L.P. have to do with it, nothing other than the coincidence which I explain below). The following if you'll bare with me, is some historical context of this show and as you know, it started a new era for the band, in addition to simply the new compositions that is, also new devices facilitating the new compositions etc.\n     Starting with what is simply weird about the Swing but of lesser significance, since it's only noticeably on the audience tape; I got from a fellow who recorded from \"a\" balcony. Why I saw \"a\" balcony is because, there were only balconies on either side, yet not in the back like most rectangular buildings, such as, for example, Winterland or the Oakland Aud. (Kiaser). Those had their long axis running to and from the stage.\n     The Swing on the other hand, was at a 90 degree angle to more common configuration, i.e. it's width was much longer than it's length from the stage towards the audience. Hence, the audience tape I had before the \"Betty Board\" came out, sounded very lopsided! Despite this, it had an uncut \"Franklin's Tower\" unlike the first board I got! However, unfortunately the fellow from whom I got my first board copy, was unwilling to let me do the dub it myself, yet he didn't pay enough attention to the contents of recordings were prior to copying it. So consequentially, I lost the intact audience \"Franklin's Tower\" having been recorded over with the board which was cut in \"Franklin's Tower\". So, I was relieved that it's been patched here!\n     What's more significant but not readily apparent, is the mention of \"technical difficulties\" by Bob Weir early in the first set; (not that equipment delays were very unusual but this one was unique). That is, here Steve Parish was rigging Garcia into a Moog synthesizer which Keith played ever so briefly!\n     One gets the distinct impression that Keith apparently disliked electric keyboards. This is understandable given how primitive synthesizers were at this early time! Moreover Billy K. was interviewed in B.A.M. magazine around the time of Brent's first show, stating there was room for improvement in the technology which came since obviously they used them extensively later on. How much did this have to do or not with Keith's eventual exit from the band? I did hear something when Brent came in the band, that they were looking for \"more sustain\", as can be produced with electric keyboards.\n     Other evidence for this is a show a Texas later this same year, but I wasn't in attendance so I can't say for sure yet Keith seems to have left the stage after very briefly playing an \"electric\" during the beginning of \"Playin' in the Band\"? (Perhaps it's not appropriate to characterize Keith in this way since at least the following year he played for example, at the outdoor show at my alma mater when I was a freshman, at U.C. Santa Barbara, an electric \"Fender Rhodes\" piano), as well as an organ on a few tunes during his first rehearsals in '71.\n     So, back to Garcia, who just started using the \"Unity Gain\" effects loop into his volume knob on his guitar five months prior to this, at the show the day before my first show (i.e. the 1st one with \"The Who\" at Oakland Stadium\" 1976/10/9). Here at the Swing was the first use of the new \"Mutron\" envelope filter, (synthesizer-like device), which still at this early time apparently had to be piped through a Moog synthesizer, configured as such for this debut of \"Estimated Prophet\" yet it was odd to see Jerry plugged into Keith!\n     Now, I'm not saying Dead Heads in general feel as my personal friends at the time did who weren't too enthused by bands such as E.L.P. which among others used synthesizers extensively, however I was more open minded. I remember pointing out to my friend as Steve Parish was plugging Jerry into the Moog since we were up in the front of this $7.50 general admission concert.\n     The state of the art at the time was that synthesizers could only play a single note at a time i.e. monophonic, and only Keith Emerson at the time had a keyboard capable of polphony until later. Another coincidence, is that the only other famous professional guitarist that I ever saw play live using a \"Travis Bean\" guitar besides Jerry Garcia was Greg Lake, (Jerry's had a sticker on it saying \"The enemy is listening\"); not that that has anything to do with it but it is still true!\n     Some of you may remember around '89ish when briefly, (which I only saw once at The Forum in Inglewood, Ca.), Parish bring out a gray Stratocaster with a big box, (Roland Synthesizer?), attached to the bridge for Jerry to noodle on during the \"Improvisation\" section; (I refuse to call it \"Space\", since there is no air in outer space, hence no sound). I knew folks who felt this is one of the best early renditions of \"Slipknot!\" I myself am kind of bias, since it was the only one I saw before they brought it back out at Tempe, Ariz. in '83!\n\n     Augy\n     San Diego",

I can't think of another Terrapin where he plays so confidently and majestically.  An overall killer show, one of the high points of the K&D years.  What a grate one-- in my personal top 3 of 77.",

Consummately tight, clean, and inspired performance by all members of the band.  They definitely had benefited from the studio time spent recording Terrapin Station, not to mention a most-excellent year in 1976 coming off their hiatus.  I've listened to this SBD many times, just refreshing my memory this morning.  Their first concert presentation of Terrapin is one of their best, but also seems to serve as a \"bright inspiration\" which moved them to greater heights in the rest of the show.  For instance, the very next song, \"New, New Minglewood Blues,\" is absolutely smoking hot, with fierce and daring solos by Jerry.  Probably my favorite version of all.  I don't generally get too excited about TLEO, but this performance is not only smooth and mellow, but Jerry's solo is outstanding.  Amazing how the guy could do something so extremely difficult (improvisation), spur of the moment, and make it sound so simple and planned.  Anything but, of course.  Just reminds me how Garcia was one in a million.  And the Sugaree is relatively concise at 11 minutes, but among the all-time great versions, in my opinion and that of many others.   I won't continue to gush, because others have done this in abundance on prior posts.  But this show is a definite keeper, 5-stars.   \n\n-Adam",

God Bless The Grateful Dead and the thousands of people who took the time and care to go and record these gigs! I just love being able to google a date and a gig shows up. I recently tried this: I typed in 7\\7\\87 and cranked it up. Yup they were onto the # 7 being prevalent that day and KILLED IT!.

      "review_text": "Top Of The Line: Best of the Best This was a decade before my 1st show at Alpine 87 (just a little note). When I first started listening to the Dead, in 86, I couldn't get my hands on enough of their tapes. All studio to start, until my 1st Alpine show when a guy in a neighboring tent traded me my 1st live bootleg tape from April of 84 THEN IT ALL BEGAN! I WAS HOOKED ON LIVE DEAD TAPES. I quickly evolved to taper by the next yr. I made good taper friends and picked this show up early on. A Betty Board, and instantly my best sounding, and most favorite Live show (or top 5) of all time. The 1st live Terrapin, best quality and best played (IMO) of all time. The debut of Estimated is also one of my all time favorite performances because of its most laid-back reggae feeling jams with a subtle taste of disco, as well. Every song in both sets has it's own distinct sound to it that sets it apart from most others. I agree with all the other reviews of this show and the quality of each of the songs. My other favs of this night was the chillaxed Help-Slip-Frank, and esp the Eyes->Phil Zone bass jam->Dancing that are the smoking highlights of the 2nd set and best pairing/segue way of these 2 tunes (in fact, IDT there is another show with a Eyes->Dancing that I know of?). I had 500+ live Dead shows in my collection by 95 and this Swing show was my best sounding, most top 5  fav of them all. Of course 1977 was a phenomenal yr for the band and you'd be hard pressed IMO to find a bad show from this yr. A zenith yr for the GD where they were at the top of their game. Simply put, there was no other band (at the time) like the Grateful Dead. (Then came PHISH, but THAT is a WHOLE nother category of bands that ONLY share the same type of fans and following, and free-form improv jam-bands as influenced by the GD) \ud83d\udc9c&\u262e\ufe0fOut ",
