From the first note of \"Minglewood,\" it's clear the band is \"on.\"  Each set is a winner.  Others have rightly noted the quality of \"Half-Step\"; I'd like to also point out the nearly flawless versions of \"TLEO,\" \"Jack A Roe,\" and \"Sunrise.\"  Note, too, the first-set close:  \"Scarlet/Fire,\" a very spacey coda for a robust opening act.  You'll find the second set just as strong.  With its clear, well-balanced soundboard source, 5/17/77 is a great additition to your 1977 collection.",

There was no barricade down front..a bloke could stand belly-up to the stage.

Jerry's playing and singing are just amazing, and the rest of the band follows right behind him.  The Half-Step, TLEO, Jack Straw, Jack-A-Roe (unique version), BE Women, Estimated, Playin' (+Reprise) and Wharf Rat, among others, are all first-rate.  The Scarlet>Fire deserves separate mention because it is sick, sick, sick and easily in my all time top 5.  \n\nDo not miss this show and spread the word to others!!",

Wow!\n\nI don't have much to say that has not already been said.  1/2 Step is great (not Boston Garden from 05/07 great, but great none the less), Big River and Scarlet/Fire to end the first set(?) are also great - the transition between Scarlet and Fire is especially unique here.  The Jack-A-Roe is unbelievable, the best I've ever heard.  On some of the old sea shanty songs (like Peggy-O) the band tended to start off with one funkier rhythm and move on to the \"normal\" rhythm mid-way through the first verse, usually because Jerry slowed things down and played it straight, but not here - the funky beat continues throughout.  I've never heard a version that comes close to this one.\n\nIn the second half of the show, Estimated Prophet cooks but, for me, Wharf Rat goes to a whole other level, especially in the big crescendo 3/4 of the way through.  This is followed by an incredibly vibrant reprise to Playin' In The Band and a Sugar Magnolia encore (the aud sounds great, by the way) that leaves you wanting to light more matches, per Bobby's instructions.

      "review_text": "More than this I will not ask... This week we dive into a very hot and unique show, 5/17/77. This was a nickj and TOOTMO recommendation, and I also had a few other people Email me about this one after my glowing review of 5/25. I have given this show at least ten full listens, and I really could not ask for much more enjoyment out of a show that I have not heard before now. This show is very different than 5/25 imo. This one is more structured and well played, and not quite as drifty or dreamy. More chops, less improvisation. I mean, of course the solos and what not are improved, but when you listen, it sounds like damn near perfect versions of tunes you know, just the way you like them. Anyhow, here goes.. \n\nWe start off with a very stout Minglewood, and right from the jump you know the boys are all business. Everyone sounds spot on and Phil is coming through nicely. We jump right into the mighty Mississippi, and mighty this one is. Donna and Jerry\u2019s harmonies are a thing of beauty right here. Both sounding unbelievably good, and Jerry\u2019s first two solos reach incredible highs. This one is pure butter and amongst the best I have heard. Kieth is right where he should be, and this shit is damn near perfect. WOW. Now that\u2019s a Mississippi! Next up is El Paso and my barometer is right on the mark. Jerry starts doing scales the moment the rhythm starts, and this is a classic un-hurried version, which Phil also shines on. In order for El Paso to be top notch, you need the harmonies to be built up just right, and Bobby needs to sound relaxed. He does and this is a great El Paso. TLEO is up next, and just the way I like it. A bump up in speed from the \u201976 JGB crawl versions, with some serious flair on the solos. Let me mention Jerry\u2019s vocals again. Unreal. Jack Straw comes in next and is a straight up smoker! When they play any song this fucking well is really hard not to be awestruck by how incredibly solid it sounds. This is classic GD at full power right here. All timer and this first set is shockingly good so far. I mean really freakin\u2019 good. To complete the original Pair O\u2019 Jacks, we have my new all time Jack-a-Roe. I have not heard a version that comes close to this one. No wonder Phil picked it for Phil Zone. I have to admit, I don\u2019t remember it from Phil Zone(probably cause I listened to Phil Zone once or twice and philed it). Only the second time ever played and WAY bouncier than any other Ive heard. Why the moved this from the funked out rhythm to a more conventional country-esque rhythm Ill never know. Keep it this way boys, shit \u2013 I mean Ben(my 3 year old son) heard the bass line and looked over at me with a huge smile and started straight up shakin\u2019 a leg to the fat groove. Love, Love, Love this Jack-a-Roe!! LLR is next up, and slows things a bit. It\u2019s done about as well as it can be done, and I have to admit my bias against this tune is slowly fading. Donna, when she is on(like tonight), really enhances every tune she takes part in. She sounds ever so sweet\u2026....... I love you Donna from May \u201977 - Love, Tim from May '12..... Tennessee rolls out next, and its a pretty standard version but the crowd surely loves it! Passenger is up next and is another tune I never really enjoy no matter how well it is done \u2013 just too damn disco-ee for my taste. I dunno, it just seems so damn hoky to me. High Time comes out of no where next, and this is some classic chill inducing shit right here. I will go out on a limb again and say this is the best High Time I have heard - by far. I was literally shaking my head in disbelief upon first listen on just how fucking good this one is. Rather than beat it to death I will say this, another new #1 for me right here. Absolutely remarkable. Big River gets things rolling again, really nice job on this one. Jerry is really busy and Bobby sounds great. Classic, straightforward version that is very well played. Nice compliment to High Time. OK, so Sunrise is next. I will tell you this about Sunrise \u2013 every time I listen to it conjures up images of the Connery era Bond flicks from the early sixties. I always thought this tune done just the way it is this particular evening would make a wonderful retro Bond movie score(with Donna dancin round as the Bond girl). As far as how I feel about it \u2013 shit, its Sunrise. It is at the very top of the heap of suckiness as far as I am concerned. They round out the first set with an awesome rendition of Scarlett>Fire. Since reviewing 5/22, I have probably given about 20 of the best known/recommended S>F\u2019s a listen, and it amazes me how the little nuances make all of the difference. For instance this one seems on the surface to be a pretty straightforward well played version. After a few more listens, this one has a wonderful seemless transition that Jerry firmly controls. He also does this open chord kinda thing \u2013 Waaa - Waaa - Waaa that really works well to ramp up Fire. Fire starts up and never looks back. Phil sounds fantastic and this combo is shit hot. I mean what else can I say about this wonderful combo. This one is incredible and at least as good as 5/22, yet on a totally different level. \n\nThoughts on the first set \u2013 Its amongst the best first sets I have ever heard. Even with the inclusion of Passenger and Sunrise(two songs I have severe bias against), it took nothing away from this masterpiece. Top shelf top ten first set from any era imo. I am completely blown away by the incredibly poised, beautiful sound these guys have this evening. I am starting to think the vocals by everyone during this time period have a lot to do with the hype that May \u201977 gets \u2013 well deserved I might add. \n\nThe second set kicks off with a Samson>Bertha> Good Lovin\u2019 combo that really delivers. The Bertha especially has lots of kick. Billy and Mick both really stand out on the Good Lovin\u2019. These aren\u2019t best evers, but all three are well played respectable versions. Brown Eyed Women follows up really nicely. Im not sure if its just the placement or what, but Jerry really sounds nice here. Vocals are as soft and smooth as could be, without a flub or crack in sight. Pure velvet this evening. The boys roll out Estimated next, right on cue. Not unlike almost every other Estimated from May \u201977 I have heard, this one soars. Bobby sounds healthy and virile as ever, Donna\u2019s on point and Jerry\u2019s damn near perfect tone and beefy wah are something to be heard. Right from the first solo Jerry is weaving his way all around this one with the greatest of ease. It just feels right, and it is placed perfectly, tucked right in the center of the second set. Really nice and an excellent precursor for the jam to come. Terrapin>Playin\u2019>Drums>Rat>Playin comes up next, so grab a cold one because it is officially on! This Terrapin, simply put is the best I have ever heard. Not only would I go so far to say this is the best ever, I think it\u2019s one of the finest pieces to ever come out of the boys. I have never heard a version of Terrapin that is played so perfectly, yet soars so high and so effortlessly, before this one. If you have heard this one before, bust it out again \u2013 If not, get on that shit. One word to describe this remarkable version \u2013 Majestic. Best of the best. It pretty much encompasses all things GD in my book. I can find absolutely no fault in this Terrapin. A shining example of top shelf May \u201977 material. They pretty much come to a extremely quick full stop and jump knee deep right into Playin\u2019. This Playin\u2019 is pretty damn unique because of the way it evolves. Its starts out reminding me of Skullfuck, just straight up rip snort snarl shit, and Bobby and Donna are givin\u2019 it hell fo sho. At about the 4 minute mark they jump right into the deep end of the pool, and instantly switch to \u201974 style meandering. Jerry ever present with his underwater licks \u2013 it\u2019s time to go exploring. This was such a pleasant surprise upon first listen \u2013 I mean who really thought we would go \u201974 mode at the drop of a hat. One more thing, at about the 10 minute mark it sounds like Phil is trying to get Jerry to go Spanish Jam or something \u2013 I mean Im not really sure who was doing what, yet I know I heard a little Spanish Jam tease in there. Great little exploratory jam that evolves into Drums and then Rat. I want to talk a little about Rat here. Right when they are making the transition Jerry does this weird little noodling thing I don\u2019t think I have ever heard before outta him at the start of Rat. Really cool and really unique. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s not really committed yet or what, but when he drops in he certainly pulls at those heart strings one last time with this sad story. Wonderfully told and beautifully played, this Wharf Rat shines on its own as well. They morph it from there back into Playin reprise which brings it all back together and absolutely brings the house down. Man, what a closer! Phil again, really makes this jam something special. He and Jerry seem perfectly in synch throughout this show. They come back and do a very nice Sugar Mags to close out the show. A little banter from Bobby and Phil, off they go, and this one is in the history books. Man what an unbelievable show that was. \n\nThoughts \u2013 I have no idea how a show gets any better than this one. Absolute top shelf performance with a first rate set list. I am now convinced that the wonderfully smooth and solid vocals from the whole crew add a extra dimension to these May \u201977 shows. Kieth was outstanding with his fills, everyone has great tone and Billy and Mickey both sound great. What can I say, this show is exceptional by any standard. I loved it. Another A+ plus show that gets my very highest recommendation. \n\nNew #1 all timers in my book from this show \u2013 Jack-a-Roe, High Time and Terrapin.",

This show doesn't have a long jam like the Not Fade from 5/8/77, or the peaks like Fire or Morning Dew from that show.  It does have some very good music throughout, and a LOT of it.  From the 1/2 Step, the Scarlet>Fire, to the Estimated>Terrapin>Playin' sequence, then later all the way through to the Playin' reprise, the jamming and songs are at a high level.  Terrapin here has Jerry playing the \"right\" notes in his lead (he would later start playing it the \"wrong\" way, G-E-F instead of F-D-E, but it would work fine).  ",

      "review_text": "...and another May 77 deflagration <br />This is another one of those incredible shows that wasn't discovered until the digital/archive age, and has since gained enough traction to be considered a classic \u2013 even though it's from the most famous tour of possibly the most respected year (but then who went looking to Alabama for a classic show?). Since this date falls after the more famous War-Buffalo, and before the all-time-landmark Florida shows, it always drew curiosity. Back when one track was released on <b>Fallout from Phil</b>, we got out our DeadBase and tried to remember if we had ever heard any more of this show (I don't recall it ever being in circ or on many tapelists). Could this be a hidden Barton, another 4/30 Palladium? It's close in quality to those top-to-bottom consistent shows, with stratospheric  high points in both sets. Yet, even though it's still the May '77 sound, it's a different animal than the others. And look at that 1st set list ffs! It's insane. I'm surprised they didn't throw in a Wheel or a China>Rider!\n\n1st set. Rips from the start with one of the best <i>Minglewoods</i> evah. Keith is totally ON in <i>Mississippi</i>. <i>They Love Each Other</i> is near-perfect, and then there are the <i>Jacks, Straw & Roe</i>, which are incomprehensibly great (only Jack-a-Roe was on <b>Fallout</b>, frustratingly, since that release did not fill the discs). This was the third one, and the first nailed. <i>Looks Like Rain</i> is at least as good as other '77s and then the set flags to merely above average (except for a nondescript <i>Tennessee</i>). This was the first of only three <i>High Time</i>s in '77. Finishing, <i>Fire</i> is average until the end then ... Bam! Big jam city.\n\n2nd set. The hot streak is likewise in the first half, with possibly the greatest <i>Samson</i> evah! You'll think it's a great version to start with but it just gets better and better leaving you to find a Band-Aid for your jaw . <i>Bertha</i> is rendered whipsnap and kickass. The excellent <i>Good Lovin'</i> has a festive, salsa-like vibe. <i>Brown-Eyed</i> is great but merely in the top 20 of this stellar year; followed by a classic early-'77-style <i>Estimated</i>. The set then throttles back to merely above average. <i>Terrapin</i> is the shakiest of the set but check the weird curveball Jer throws at ~3:49 that isn't picked up by the rest but that wraps around and, having stated the eventuality, re-affects Jer. The encore is a bit unstable.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall = 5 stars\n\nHighlights:\nWhole First Set \u2013 some are best-of-all-time candidates\nSamson & Delilah \u2013 gets better and better\nBertha \u2013 fast perfection\nGood Lovin' \u2013 hotter than soup\nEstimated Prophet \u2013 supernal\n\nSOURCES: The weiner_18554 is the best SBD. The whole show is in the <b>May 1977</b> box. Jack-a-Roe is on <b>Fallout</b>. Otherwise, sources aren't as varied as others from Spring '77, and the circulating soundboard is somewhat lifeless (the too-quiet second set can be normalized; it's also a tad fast, and the encore is way too fast, <u>needing -3%</u> pitch correction), while the matrix runs too slow.",

      "review_text": "Impeccable Alabama Dead This show could hold its own in the ring with any other show they ever did, including anything else from the merry month of May \u201877. That's saying a lot.\n\nShows from that legendary Spring \u201877 tour can sometimes come off as so polished, so perfect, and so clean that you can glaze over while listening to them\u2026 unless they have some sort of twist. The Cornell show wouldn\u2019t be the Cornell show if they didn\u2019t give that extra bite to Row Jimmy, Dancin\u2019, St. Stephen, and Morning Dew. The Boston show wouldn\u2019t be the Boston show if they hadn\u2019t thrown that little pinch of extra sugar onto Friend of the Devil and Eyes of the World. Any band can be locked into perfect synchronization and have the best instrumental tonality in the world, but you still have to walk the tightrope, try something new, and roll the dice to achieve the transcendent. May \u201877 saw all the pieces fall into place: wonderful instrumental tones (with each instrument perfectly complimenting the others), total musical lockstep between the musicians, and plenty of shows where the band had an appetite for (and grand success with) taking risks. This combination is what makes May \u201877 the musical equivalent of melting butter.\n\nThe \u201ctwist\u201d associated with this show isn\u2019t so much maneuvers they took in one song or the other, as much as it is the show\u2019s context, the band\u2019s strategic approach, and their choice of setlist. Twelve years in, this was the first ever Grateful Dead show in the state of Alabama. When they were performing for a new audience, let alone a new state, they would often set out to prove themselves with a heater, and this show is no exception. Garcia applies a fair amount of country twang and bluegrassesque picking to his solos, perhaps out of respect for his surroundings. Things don\u2019t get overly trippy until the band gets good and comfortable. After a mammoth, heavily countrified dozen-song first set, they uncork an unbelievable second set, highlighted by a majestic sequence of Terrapin > Playin\u2019 > Drums > Wharf Rat > Playin\u2019.\n\nTerrapin Station songs had a special novelty and energy to them during the live performances of 1977, and that\u2019s evident in the Estimated Prophet and Terrapin Station in this show. What\u2019s more, you could pick up on this impending Wharf Rat throughout the second set. We\u2019ve all been there; you sense a certain song hovering above the stage, 100% certain that its manifestation is inevitable, even if it hasn\u2019t been musically teased or quoted. It has strictly to do with energy. This Wharf Rat is virtually hanging in the air above the band, until Jerry\u2019s strumming casually lassos it out of Drums and reels it down into the arena. Majestic, magical stuff.\n\nI would also be remiss not to highlight Donna Jean Godchaux\u2019s contributions. An Alabama girl herself, this show was a homecoming, and she delivered as the band\u2019s venerable secret weapon. She had some angelic performances in the \u201870s, and this is one of best, with wonderful harmonies and even a rare Sunrise. When Donna\u2019s right on the money with her vocal harmonies, the effect is so natural, so subtle, that you can easily miss it. But that same subtlety and softness is what makes it so perfect. At the very end of this Brown-Eyed Women, as Jerry concludes with the final lines \u201cand it looks like the old man\u2019s getting on\u2026 and it looks like the old man\u2019s getting on\u201d, Donna and Bob meet Jerry\u2019s voice with a wordless, crooning, softly rising vocal harmony, achieving a sublime, beautiful, but devastatingly sad effect true to the story of the song. Sweet Jesus, this band was capable of things other groups could never even touch.\n\nAll in all, an incredible May \u201877 taste of Alabama Dead. This one cracks my top 10 shows of all time, if not the top 5. ",
