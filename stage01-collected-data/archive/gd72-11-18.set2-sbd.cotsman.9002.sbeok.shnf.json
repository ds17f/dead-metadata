To paraphrase Dick L., Phil makes those bass notes so big you feel like your head could explode. The Playin' alone is more than enough to download this show, since the rest of it is pretty much standard '72. The sound quality is somewhat hissy, too, but good nonetheless.",

You can see it as he explores a jam listening to Jerry and the drummers and how his facial expressions transport him into unchartered territory and he laughts at himself when he tries to \"eternally recur\" ala Nietzche with an improvised couplet.  \nRemember, boys and girls Phil played Stan Kenton before the dead played through him.  Many don't realize the importance of Phil's guitar playing bass style as well as his transcendental ability to conjure a jam from thin air.\n    Phil transports this Playin to beyond ordinary dimensions.  Could be the twenty-third by now.   \n    How could Phil be too loud?  Hint: turn down the bass or loudness control.\n    Jerry is also a maniac during Playin and rendering a mind-bending space jam that will melt your brain.",

Jerry goes nuts, so does Phil, Bill, Keith, Bobby, even the stage-hands.  Intense is the correct word here.\n\nLike other posters alluded to, Phil is overmixed and really overpowers Jerry and the gang.  I find it hard to enjoy the song because he is something like 2x louder than Jerry.\n\nSo I can't give it \"my favorite.\"  Not yet.  As of right now my two favorite versions are 2/26/77 and 8/21/72 (not Veneta!...The Berkeley show).  I'm listening to these two right now before I give this Playin' it's fair ranking in my list of all time favorite Playin's.  And I'm one of those Playin' whores, yup.\n\nJust my opinion.",
