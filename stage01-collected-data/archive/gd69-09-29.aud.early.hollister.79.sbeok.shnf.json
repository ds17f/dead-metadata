And unfortunately the sound on this recording may be the worst of the whole 67-69 psychodelic period.  Vocals are 90% missing.  But this may still be one the most important nights to download because of \"The Seven\". As it is a jam, missing vocals aren't an issue.  But friends, believe me, IMHO this may be their greatest jam of the whole 67-69 period.  I may be wrong, but this is the only recording of \"The Seven\" with the full band (see Mickey and the Hartbeats Oct 68).  It is mindblowing from the first note segueing out of \"Doing that Rag\" to the last note marching into \"Good Loving\".  Not one bad note from anyone. \n\nYou'll find great versions of St Stephen>Eleven etc. dozens of other times.  But this is the only version \"The Seven\" and it is perfect!  Why this jam was never a staple of 1968-69 is amazing.",

      "review_text": "All Hail the Seven! Once in a while, in the annals of Grateful Dead history, the boys deliver an absolutely mind-blowing jam when you least expect it. Jams falling into this category would be the 5/21/74 PITB, the 7/27/73 Jam>Wharf Rat, and the 12/6/73 DS. The Seven is such an amazing jam that I'll give 5 stars for that alone (although everything else is very good, even the ill-fated Doin' that Rag). I won't add anything to what the reviewer below me says, since this version of the Seven is easily the best circulating version of only 4 known to have been played. Why it wasn't developed further has to be one of the great mysteries in GD lore. \n\nAs for the sound quality, why complain? The AUD is quite acceptable, IMO. It sounded great on an old tape I had years ago and sounds even better now. Would you rather not have this piece of history on record? Download immediately.",

      "review_text": "Why not EQ in the digital realm ? Given the level of technology shown in the lineage (and in other notes on other shows), I don't understand why EQ was not applied digitally to this recording.\n\nI remember being too poor to avoid a tape any better than Maxell UD, but it's sad that that happens to be the best version of this show.  It's hard to underestimate the lack of musical response of a UD cassette - designed for voice dictation only.\n\nGiven that, and the overwhelming brightness that is no doubt the result of the Dolby B encoding, it is really necessary to EQ this, with a large take down of the area roughly at 3khz.  A corresponding peak around 300-400 hz gives some warmth that is otherwise lacking.\n\nThe only saving grace of the recording itself is the surprisingly good mix, especially for an audience recording.   It's baffling as to what happened to the vocals - it might have just been a fault of the cafe sound guy at the gig.\n\nThe good mix means that the recording can be used as snapshot of what happened that night.   However, like most poor audience recordings, it is hard to enjoy listening - it's just an academic exercise.\n\nNow, as far as the performance itself goes, yes the Seven is pretty good, especially in the last few minutes where everyone gets on the same page.  However, it is ultimately \"one-dimensional\" in the sense that it's all based on the breathtaking speed of it all.. and that's it.\n\nIf a version pops up later without the Maxell UD generation, it might be worth revisiting, but otherwise I'd have to rate this \"academic interest only\" - especially in light of the hundreds of other shows here at the Archive.",

Back in the day, when we collected tapes (cassettes), sound quality was important, but getting the performances (relatively) uncut was just as, if not more, important. And MOST important of all was getting songs not available on vinyl - like a live performance of Doin' That Rag into The Seven into Good Lovin' (into Saint Stephen into The Eleven). So come along as I travel back in time 37 years, and then we'll leap even further back in time.\n\nIt's 1974, I'm 17 years old and I've quietly entered the house. It's the wee hours of the morning, and the rest of the family are asleep. It will be several hours till I can sleep, of course, because there are still several hundred micograms of acid swirling in my brain. So I slip on the headphones, snap in a cassette and press play...lay down in the dark...and am transported back in time. Five whole years! There's no time to whine about the poor sound quality, I'm too busy marveling at the miracle of time travel!\n\nI saw a neighbor I haven't seen in ten years the other day. \"What happened to the motorcycle?\" he asked. \"And your hair! You used to have more hair!\"\n\n\"You lose one,\" I told him, \"and then you lose the other.\"\n\nWe are all time travelers.",

But their psychedelic chops were as hot as ever, as evidenced by this night and the next.\n\nCafe au Go Go was a tiny (400 seat), famous (Lenny Bruce arrests for obscenity) club in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.\n\nHistory was made this night. I can find a total of only two times they played \"The Seven,\" and one of those wasn't even the complete band (Mickey and The Hartbeats).\n\nBottom line: you should record this and make copies for your friends and neighbors.\n\nGive me a second while I climb onto my soapbox.\n\nThere should be only two tracks here, because the band stopped only once: between Good Lovin' and St. Stephen. Listen to the amazing segue from The Seven into Good Lovin'. Listen to it the way they played it. You can't - not unless you have a 40-plus-year-old copy on cassette or reel-to-reel.\n\nAnybody know of a better Doin' That Rag?",

The vocal problem could be explained by the taper being too close to the band and the vocals coming through the PA's speakers, which are usually a few rows away from the stage.   Anyone who has sat up front at a show, especially in a club has experienced the vocals being behind them.  The cuts and drop out etc are all a part of the tape.  We have been spoiled by so many great shows, of outstanding quality, that maybe we forget about what tape collecting was like in the '70's and later.  Radio broadcasts copied so many times, that the hiss and low levels made for shows that didn't sound great, but it was all we had, and I know I played the shit out of them.  So for me I'm just please that this example is here until another one comes out.",

      "review_text": "cream/familiar fan response Sure you,myself would have liked to have seen a 'clone' show from 69 in 1980 etc but the DEAD  were continually playing and evolving unlike Cream which STOPPED in 68 at Royal Albert Hall and then 'resumed' at ROYAL ALBERT HALL. As a band their music hadnt evolved over the years it stopped in 68 then resumed in what was it 2005. So no evolution just basically resumed from where they left off. The sound WAS different but the arrangements were almost identical again no natural evolution and these guys didnt get along so the thought of them agreeing on new arrangement at this late date was basically not going to happen. Ginger Baker in particular had a distaste for playing with Jack Bruce always complaining he was too loud. So their only real option was play it the 'same' to avoid disagreement and cash the checks. I wouldnt be surprised if even Clapton did it for the money. More recently he's spoken about getting too old to tour but would play those high end corporate shows like aerosmith,etc. Play at a stockholder's meeting or for a corporate employee event for big bucks. You can complain all you want about how much the Dead made post 85/87 but they still had a lot of employees at GDP that were well(overpaid) compensated plus they continued to spend a fortune on sound quality right up until the end. Experimenting with 'beam' speakers to get accurate sonic fields at ALL locations in the venue. Meyer sound, ultra sound took a big hit when Garcia died and the fall tour was canceled and the future was unknown. The DEAD were dream clients  for audio companies that were  on the edge of inovation etc. They had a BIG client that would finance their experiments with new equipment etc i've spewed enough. good night. by the way I still have my laminate for cream at the Garden.

      "review_text": "Everything wanders, from baby to Z The Seven is the definite highlight. My favorite part about this rare jam is how there\u2019s 3 or 4 different passages in there. Some segments are angular, sharp, chatty, and mathematical. Then there\u2019s one portion that\u2019s gorgeously melodic and airy; almost classical. It\u2019s an ingenious display that really shows the Grateful Dead\u2019s creative versatility.\n\nI have a few other takeaways from this show. One is that it\u2019s just plain happy. There\u2019s no blues, gloomy Death Don\u2019t Have No Mercy, spooky Dark Star, or vicious The Other One waiting there to drag you to the murky depths. Instead, this whole recording just floats delightfully along the surface, like a really stoned duck, occasionally taking a dip to test the waters below before popping back up into the sunshine. Did they play other material on 9/29/69 that didn\u2019t make the tape? Maybe. But I think this recording is perfect as is. It doesn\u2019t need a half-hour Lovelight or any extras. It\u2019s just a short, sweet, joyous AUD capturing the rhapsody of the Aoxomoxoa boys playing New York City in the fall. You can tell that even back then, New York crowds were a totally different animal.\n\nAnother takeaway is how well the mix favors Bob Weir\u2019s guitar. It\u2019s a muddy AUD tape, no bones about it, but the only real casualty is the organ. The pitch of TC\u2019s instrument just doesn\u2019t cut through very well, so it\u2019s mostly nestled in the tape hiss floating out of your speakers. The other instruments are very audible, even Phil\u2019s bass, but Bobby\u2019s guitar really shimmers right out in front of the ensemble. It\u2019s a great showcase of his craft in that era. \n\nAlso of note is Drums. This is one of the best Drums I\u2019ve ever heard. There are a couple spots where Bill and Mickey are slicing and dicing it to pieces, and they hit warpspeed in total synchronization. It\u2019s like two cheetahs sprinting at full speed in complete lockstep. Astounding Drums. This is also a dandy of a St. Stephen > The Eleven. The tempo is fast without flying off the rails, so they can really sink the fangs into it and pack in the notes while still giving them texture. Based on other reviews it seems like this recording was circulating at least as far back as the 80\u2019s. It\u2019s an outstanding show. Come for The Seven, stick around for the rest. Makes great filler for those still burning CDs. Careful, you might catch yourself listening to this one over and over!",
