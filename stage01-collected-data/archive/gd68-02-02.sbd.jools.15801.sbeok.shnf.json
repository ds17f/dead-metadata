Both of these shows are primal Dead at it's very best. The sound quality is a little muddier than the 1/20, 1/22 and 2/14 shows. But in my humble opinion (hardly) this only adds to the value of these jamming tapes. For my money, EVERYTHING from 68 is great. One gets the combination of songs in their infancy as well as Jerry wailing on either his Les Paul or his Gibson SG. What a tone, ladies and gentlemen. If you want early primal Dead fully rounding the corner out of early 60's twang guitar and into full blown psychedalia ALL of these shows are for you. I know of what I speak. Enjoy!",

Listen to these Jan-Feb shows, and then go listen to October 68 at the Matrix and you'll see what I mean. Their playing and confidence in exploring new jams is much more developed by Oct, or even the great August shows.\nHowever, I'm partial to the sound of these early shows, as I've had the tapes for a long time. And now with these new LAMA versions, I can finally get the right dates, plus missing songs all straightened out.\nThere's not much I can add to the wonderful comments below about Viola Lee. It's everything they say, and more. Maybe the hottest version these ears have heard. The Other One is short but powerful, and Clementine long and jammy. And then they take it home with a smoking version of Schoolgirl. Pigpen is batting 100, in the driver's seat all the way. \nGreat sound, and a solid show that leaves you wanting more! Along with 2/14 of course, this show has to be one of my top shows for early 1968.\nenjoy, and crank up that Viola Lee!\nDr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "The Best Of The Tree Northwest Tours I Have The Crystal Ballroom in 1968 must have been like Birdland in 1961. Maybe it's the building, maybe it's the bands that played on the tour. Clementine has got to be the jazziest Dead song ever played and Gold And Silver (performed by Quicksilver Messenger Service and most likely played on this tour) was based on Dave Brubeck's Take Five. \nI seem to remember writing a review for this show but just in case I didn't, here's another, better one. If I had to make a list as too what the best of the three Northwest shows I have it would be:\n1. This show\n2. 1-20-68 at Eureka Muni\n3. The show after this one\n\nThe reason I say that is because while the other 1-20 and 2-3 are played with great energy and have a dream songlist and you can't beat that awesome fade out at the end of The Eleven, this show is the only one where they play different styles of music. Garage band, psychedlic, jazz, and blues. Each song feels like you're seeing a different band perform. I have to vote this as my all time favorite Grateful Dead show because I have had dreams where I'm at this concert. The beginning of Viola Lee Blues should be listen to with a warning sign for those who do not know what it's like to be blasted off into space. Listen to this show on your iPod and the repetive chord that Garcia plays after the first verse makes you feel like you are floating on air. Before I continue let me just make it clear that I am not one of those people that go around saying if you listen to Stairway To Heaven backwards, you can hear satanic verses. This Viola really is stellar, much better than the 8-4-67 one which is pretty boring to my ears. The Other One suite is the night before Bobby changed the lyrics to what we know them as today. It's a lot shorter than the ones played a couple of years later but the way Garcia joyfully plays that solo after screaming out \"You know he had to die\" during the reprise, and then the way he's able to lock himself into a new theme is, to me, pure magic. I love the way Phil's bass counts the time to Clementine.\nClementine is the treat on here. I believe only two versions Clementine have been released to the public. One on the remastered version of Aoxomoxoa, and this version, heard on So Many Roads. The lyrics are quite poetic but the music is like cool jazz, not too light but not too heavy either. Just right porridge. The day I fell in love with this song I actually wanted to go out and buy Clementine oranges and listen to this song while eating them. \nGood Morning Little Schoolgirl is like being at a Sonny Boy Williamson show in the late 30s. It's the one song on this set to have the most vocals and Pig is satisfying as usual. The end of the song has Phil and Bobby in a little duet before Jerry makes one last little squawk and they call it quits.",

      "review_text": "Fabulous Anthem-era show February 1968 is an outstanding month of shows near the end of the 6-month Anthem of the Sun recordings. The run of 2/2, 2/03, 2/14, and 2/23-2/23 Kings Beach Lake Tahoe (aka, Dick\u2019s Picks Vol. 22) are all outstanding shows in an outstand run of Anthem shows. You can also throw in 1/20/68, and it rivals any run in the history of the Dead.\n\nStart with a prime Viola Lee that ends in a vintage-period feedback. Cryptical/Other One is short, but high-energy, driving psychedelia, but also tight and musical, in the classic Anthem style. Cryptical simmers down not to New Potato, as it usually did in this period, but to the rare Clementine, played on 5 times (according to Deadbase). Jerry soars on guitar after his first verse of vocals. Clementine was inspired by John Coltrane\u2019s My Favorite Things, which also is in 3/4 meter and has a long jam on two chords. Clementine slips easily into Good Morning Schoolgirl. Pigpen is brilliant on harp and delivers spot-on vocals.\n\nSix minutes into Schoolgirl, Pigpen raps \u201cI wanna be your king bee, I wanna find all about your stinger.\u201d King Bee was a slow, sultry blues piece that Dead used to throughout 1966 and revived in \u201869. (Pigpen fans check out 11/19/66.)\n\nThere is another show more recently upload to Archive also called \u201c2/2/68.\u201d However, it has a somewhat different set list. There\u2019s a Clementine clearing going into New Potato, not Schoolgirl. It sounds like the same Clementine. Listening to it, it sounds like the Clementine>Potato is an edit with fades, and that real performance was Clementine>Schoolgirl\n\nThe other 2/2/68 \u201cshow\u201d is good (a 5-star collection), but I like this better.

The set finishes with a nice back & forth hing with Jerry & Pig to round out a beautiful & emotional set with Good Morning little School Girl (one of my favorite Pig songs & then low and behold: it's from a completely different show-----eeeekkk! Why, you may ask does that bother me? Really, it's just because in past reviews I'd thought Pig gets kinda put on the back-burner; I am by no means a huge Pig fan & before anyone gets like all fired that I say anything harsh about Pig- please, just hear me out!\nWhen it came to the keys I'm a Brent fan anyway; but, Pig was an icon of the original crew- people loved the Pig 'cuz he was the Reverend of Love and Sex- he didn't look it-but he was out front trying to mow some lawn- you know trying to get the vibe out there. Jerry was hitting people with decibels of ear piercing mania- I guess if I ate as much acid as they I'd probably be manic too; but, my point is this: Jerry solo'd 'til he somehow drifted back to the stage from his out of body experience; but Pig, on the other hand git the shaft show after show- was it because he didn't have anything good to say on his organ? Maybe he couldn't solo- I certainly haven't heard anything special; but then again Bob doesn't solo either. Maybe I'm babbling on about nothing; but what about Brent- that guy got solo & he was god, right? Keith too, nothing too special; but, that doesn't seem to matter to Jerry,\"Go ahead Keith, take one!\" Then he goes tinkle tinkle tinkle & I go \"That was pretty nice.\" But, what about the Pig? If anyone know of any great Pig organ solo's give me the 411-yo! Otherwise, this is a high grade, high quality, serve & smile recording.Ace's High.",
