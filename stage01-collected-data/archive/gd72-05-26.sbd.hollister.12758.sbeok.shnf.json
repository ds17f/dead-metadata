This was their last night in Europe, and there's a high level of energy and finesse throughout.  The Truckin' > AM Dew jam was good enough to be included (in edited form) on the Europe '72 album.  It's hard to pick out a highlight, since there is such fine playing throughout.  He's Gone comes out a little lumpy.  Everything is else is cooked to perfection.",

They could have easily quit after Playin', which seemed typical enough for 72 until they go back into the Main Ten theme and then Jerry just goes OFF. One of the highest peaks of all  time. The guitar gets weird on He's Gone, but Jerry's vocals are superb and heartfelt. It's also interesting the way the band jointly fades it out at the end. The NFA>GDTRFB>NFA simply sizzles. And we still had Pigpen to kick around (and him to kick us around, albeit for short songs only). Only China>Rider seems a little lackluster.  Jerry fades away on Rider, letting Bob have all the fun. \n\nLots of care went into this upload and the good lovin' is evident. Thank you, Jonathan. One of my favorite shows from my favorite year.",

So many hot version here it blows your mind - Cumberland, China>Rider, Jack Straw. Plus surprise - a Dire Wolf! And the Playin is just incredible. The longest they've played to this date and sounds more like 1974!\nIt's nice to hear the whole Other One segment of the famous Truckin - Morning Dew jam from the album. Not particularly special, but still a fun cosmic jam excursion for your mind. This show marks some final versions of classic Pig songs like Next Time. A must have show. Timeless!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

The first half showcases solid rock and roll/bar-band material, with the correct smattering of country and western, bluegrass, and boogie-woogie.  And then the central jam in the second half combines psychedelic flashbacks (slowed-down primal Dead) with single-drumming jazz fusion (Miles Davis style) to create a kind of music that cannot realy be explained, but has to be listened to.",

      "review_text": "Ecstacy on Every Level OMG! This show is so amazing that I cannot describe in words how much this concert has moved me.\nIn particular is the absolutely stunning Morning Dew. This is indeed the version from Europe 72m and when I found out that they edited it on Europ 72 I was fearful that the mind-blowing solos were all studio created. The only thing edited here are Jerry's vocals on the first two versons (they sound a litte rough, yet heartfelt) and there's some additional organ on the 2nd solo that wasn't there before. But I must impress upon you, this is a piece of music that EVERYONE should at least hear once. This version of MD has made me cry, quite literally. This is no doubt the BEST version of this song EVER. Compare it to 5/8/77 and there is NO comparison. You don't get music like this more than once! Jerry's voice is so soothing and heartfelt. His voice cracks a couple times, but that doesn't matter, it sounds so beautiful. The solos are what really get me. You give them a listen, and you tell me that doesn't hit you in some way emotionally. Pure music has NEVER had that effect on me. It's sooo amazingly powerful. I can't even describe how amazing it is. You HAVE to download this show. Or at least this version of morning dew. PLEASE! It renders me speachless. It's sooo...omg....it's just so good.

I don't know if I can go as far as the other reviewers on this one but it's excellent none the less.\n  Lets start with the soud quality first.Right now it's being played back through about $75,000 worth of gear and it sounds nice w/ minimal manipulation.Theres a little hiss that came right out w/ Soundsoap for you other studio guys.Very little eq'ing and it sounds awsome.Lots of dynamics that jump and move with nice stereo imaging on the whole mix.\n  The mix is perfect in every respect.The bass drum sits just above the bass guitar.With just a little low freq push if you have a sub woofer this one feels as good as it sounds.Man, those esoteric bass lines of Phil's are as prominent as the vocals.The vocal mix is as good as any Dead show I have in a collection of 600+.Jerry, Bob, and Pig are even in tune in Dire Wolf which I'm sure was a first and maybe the only.The sound gets 4 out of 5 the way it is.However w/ just a little tweak you can make it a 5 even if you don't have a studio at your disposal.\n The performance.Good, although I don't think it's as good as the other reviewers here say it is.Euro '72 is my favorite Dead tour and I'm partial to all the shows I'm lucky enough to have.And this one is no exception.If you like the vocal oriented stuff there is alot of it here and it's all good.Not as good as Dusseldorf 4/24,Rotterdam 5/11, or the most underrated show of the tour Frankfurt 4/26.\n  The second set jam is where its at for me.They go out for a while but not as far as some of the afformentioned shows but that might be a good thing if you don't dig the crazy improv pieces like I do.However, theres still plenty here to listen to.\nOverall I give the performance a 4.5 out of 5.And because it only allows whole stars here that means a 4.However the extra length of the show is also a plus.What the hell,I'll go 5 out of 5.",

Hokey smoke, as Rocky the Flying Squirrel used to say.\n\nAs a bonus, the organ and piano are clearly audible and balanced in this recording.

Nothing captures this band at its fullest and most true moment.\n\nGreat recording. Keith is high up, so is Pig's organ, and plenty of his songs! \n\nAll the first set songs are played to their best (especially BTW, Loser, Dire Wolf, The Stranger) killer versions of everything.\n\nSecond set: COMMON!!! Truckin>Other 1 Jam>Drumz>Other1>Morning Dew>Other1>Jam>Morning Dew>Other1>Sing Me Back Home\n\nNOTHING COMPARES! Pure Dead Jam moment. Sure there were some great Dark Stars and Playin' Jams on the Europe 72' tour, but really, what's better? Nothing. They saved the best for last. For sure.\n\nUPDATE 2011.12.29\n\nListening back on this show I realize that it has stood the test of time as one of my favorite shows.\n\nJust got the discs from the Europe 72: Complete Recordings and listening to it currently. Though this hollister sbd and other since updates sound incredible, David Lemieux's release really brings the full color of this incredible recording and performance to light. \n\nThis is the last show where Pigpen is really a participatory member of the band. His next show would be his last, and he would not sing (or play really) at that show. This last night of London is really the Swan Song for Ron. Yeah there's no Lovelight or Good Lovin' but his four songs that make it into the first set present some of his finest energy on the tour! The Stranger is particularly moving, and heartbreaking considering his demise. \n\nThis is the first Playing In the Band that was truly an \"extended\" version. This is a pinnacle moment in the Dead's development, as it they had created their next true powerful Jam vehicle outside of Dark Star or The Other One.  They were way past the days of Alligator, the \"jazzy-Americana\" thing was on, and Playin was in! \n\nThe show is obviously important. But the recording being so pristine is also part of the charm of this last show of the Europe 1972 tour. Pig and Keith playing with the original Grateful Dead. For the last time.",

The nineteen song 2+ hour first set, perhaps the finest of the tour, is a monster, featuring fantastic performances of Cumberland Blues, Jack Straw, China/Rider, Playin' in the Band and a surprise Dire Wolf. Concluding with a jammed out NFA> GDTRFB> NFA, this set on its own would have been a great show. But of course the band still has a bit of magic left in the tank, the second set comencing with a jam suite right off the bat. \n\nThis one will sound very familiar with the incredible Truckin' and Morning Dew immortalized on Europe '72, split by an epic 35+ minute, largely percusion driven performance of The Other One which gets reprised twice. The post Truckin' \"Epilogue\" is phenomenal. Seamless, it's difficult to discern where Truckin' ends and The Other One begins, Jerry and Keith are locked in so tightly. A brief but intense bass solo preceeds the intro theme. After a great drum solo the theme fires up again. Keiths playing is extraordinary here. During a brief segment just prior to the first verse he sounds like Steve Winwood. \n\nThe following ten minute post-verse \"Prelude\" to Morning Dew is one of the most compelling passages that the band has ever played. After the phenomenal performance of Morning Dew the band finds their way back into The Other One. Three minutes into second reprise there is some rather cool interplay between Weir and Garcia which is followed by a brief but sublime duet between Pigpen and Keith that must be heard to be believed. Simply beautiful, it's an amazing conclusion to this epic tour. (100 pts)",

A cohesive version.\nMr. Charlie\nBTW, A+ version here, everyone is synch and it has a nice energy, no overzealous Bobby singing (he doesn\u2019t crack his voice by screaming).\nLoser, Bob and Jerry both do amazing work on the guitar here, with Phil & Keith accenting.\nNext Time You See Me, Garcia turns in a great performance here.\nEl Paso, A+ version with Garcia and Keith punctuating and Billy rising to the occasion in each of the climaxes.\nDire Wolf keeps things in the fun zone! I love how Garcia gets into the lyrics of this song, and the emphasis he puts on \u201cmeeeeee\u201d\u2026 Nice solo as well.\nTwo Souls\u2026 way to kill the momentum Pigpen.\nPITB, longest of the tour I believe. Momentum regained, and the jam starts off nicely, not a driven pace, but again quite cohesive, which leads to beauty. At 9 minutes in they add some more energy to the otherwise great jam, and things really take off as Jerry weaves his way through the song. 12 minutes in they take a step back, reloading before a nice drift back into the theme for the reprise. A great, exploratory PITB.\nHe\u2019s Gone\nCumberland Blues, hell yeah Jerome.\nJack Straw, great version, really puts you out on the open plain.\nChinatown Shuffle maintains the momentum.\nChina>Rider has nice Phil bombs leading us to the between verses solo, building a nice entry to the segue jam. Great work here.\nNFA>GDTRFB>NFA is a nice sequence to finish out the first set, even if it left them holding the bag for the second set close haha. Nice energy in the NFA, with a slightly ABB sound to it even!  GDTRFB\u2019s jam session is plenty psychedelic with great Bobby behind Jerry, the keys are both doing well, drums too. Great sequence to close the set off.\n\nTruckin\u2019>TOO>Drums>TOO>Sing Me\nTruckin\u2019 comes out truckin\u2019! Keith puts in some great early work. The energy is pretty nice through the lyrics, but the jam after it slows down into a more tradition blues approach with the first hints of TOO coming after the 10 minute mark, at which point it also speeds up a bit, then falls into a slower, exploratory jam still somewhere between the TOO and Truckin\u2019 themes. There is a nice piece starting around 14 minutes in that though it doesn\u2019t have a name is pretty consistent, there are hints of Dark Star in there actually. Things slow down, Phil gets a moment, and drops the rolling thunder intro to TOO. Even TOO has some Dark Star hints to it. We get a short drum solo, then some Jerry added in, then with a dash of Phil, this makes up the first \u201cTOO\u201d per the labelling on E72. We then get another drum solo. They sing the verse after a short re-entry to TOO, and it falls into space, and again I think Jerry is thinking Dark Star\u2026 anyhow, it\u2019s too slow for my blood. It doesn\u2019t pick back up until shortly before the 7 minute mark, where it appears to be on a course for the Tiger. Instead they maintain momentum and go closer to TOO\u2019s theme, only for Jerry to hint again at the Tiger, though he doesn\u2019t take unleash. They go heavy exploratory, quite effectively, with nice power behind it before Dew emerges. Solid Garcia throughout is capped by a fanning finale where the Dew does what the Dew is supposed to do\u2026 And they have to finish TOO after all! Another 5 minutes of TOO brings us an on a dime transition to Sing Me Back Home.\nMAMU, prior to this we get a minor revolt by Billy, he apparently didn\u2019t want to play it! He was overruled.\nRamble On\nSugar Magnolia\nCasey Jones\n\nEncore is just one more OMSN for the Euros\u2026 on a Sunday.\n\n\nPerformance Summary\nThis was the only E72 show I had a complete copy of on cassette back in the day, and I didn\u2019t have the compilation \u201cEurope 72\u201d, so this was my only real E72 representation in my early GD days. The playing is consistently tight, nuanced and trippy. The second set meat sequence actually suffers from slowness at a few points, but the set is strong. 1st set is better than the 2nd, to my ears.\n\nSound Quality\nHe\u2019s Gone seems to have either some weird effect, or some warble, otherwise stellar official release.",

I am a 21 year old college student, who recently, purchased a record player for my room and then hooked it up to my stereo in there. I went to a bunch of music shops and picked up whatever Dead I could find, which was not too much. I then went home and had to beg my parents on my knees to let me take a few of their albums from their huge collection. I was lucky enough for them to say yes, and one of the vinyls I grabbed was Europe '72. \nMorning Dew has always been one of my favorites, especially for a cover. The emotion that is put into it is unparalleled. And when the boys are on, it can bring a grown man to his knees. \nAs much as I love jams, the first time I ever listened to the Morning Dew side of the record, I went right to MD. It was the first time I've ever heard Morning Dew on vinyl, so I was excited for it. The intro is amazing, but what really got me was Jerry's voice. I was completely floored. I have NEVER Jerry's voice like that. I have trouble finding the words to describe it. It sounded so pure and so full. I was completely beside myself. I was losing my mind. It had to be one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. While I know I'll never get to see Him live or the band in it's entirety, I know that one day, I'll get to hear that sweet, sweet voice.

      "review_text": "He's Gone For Pigpen? Maybe someone could shed some light, but could this He's Gone be for Pigpen? I know the March '73 version after his death is usually thought to be the dedication to him.  And the song is supposed to be in reference to Mickey's dad being gone.  I could be wrong but don't they play it 2 songs after he sings his last song with the band, Two Souls? And Two Souls is HIS song, not a cover, not a band song, that is HIS.  After Two Souls they play PITB, and then He's Gone. After this show which closes the Euro tour, Pigpen came back and played one more show where he didn't sing a single song.  Was the plan for him to leave the band after the euro tour? Did he come back to play that final show in the states just so they could play Stella Blue for him? Not everyone sees Stella Blue as being about Pig, but that's what I always thought. Especially when you hear the lyrics in the bridge (not in Hunter's hand written notes) , \"Dust off those rusty strings just one more time. Can't keep from cryin\". Pigpen was the Blue Star of the group.  Not only for his blues style, but I see him also like a Blue Star: 10 to 100 times the mass of the sun, and burning through his fuel at a tremendous rate. \n\nAfter this show, it's almost like a totally different band to me.

      "review_text": "@JPP1727-He's gone for Pigpen? It is reported (e.g. by journalist Pasquale di Bello in 1992) that \"... The song \"He's gone\" will be ironically dedicated to Lenny Hart ... \" after he \" ... left with a good slice of the group money .\" This occurred in Febr. 1971. PigPen left this world in March 1973. \nAnd this show certainly is one of the most outstandings; man, they had a four-night-stand at the Lyceum.",
