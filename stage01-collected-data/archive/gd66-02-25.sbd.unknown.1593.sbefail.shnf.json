Absoultely neccessary for any Pigpen fans out there, as he doesn't sing a single bad note as he sometimes did and is probably the only other person in the band to have ever taken a solo besides Jerry.  But I digress, this is Grateful Dead Gold.  Lets face it, they were never even close to as good as this from '68 on.  Jerry is playing the best he ever did (especially on the solo on 'I Know You Rider') than in the decades to come and the band as a whole held it all together much better during this era.  Truly one of the best concert on this site.",

Deadbase 10 doesn't have a set list for this date and where the heck was the Ivar Theater anyway. This sounds, in part at least, like a studio practice session, the cuts on several songs like Rider don't sound like tape shut-offs as much as a band rehersal where the 'leader' ends the tune with a hand gesture. But still, the other reviewer who used the term 'petri dish' is entirelly apt, this is a real missing link type of 'show' that reveals where the band is coming from or what they were trying to do when they looked like (and sounded like) British Mod Rockers, the old style of Rider for example and the total jam from Schoolgirl>You Don't Love Me>Schoolgirl is outstanding. Pig is outstanding and plays a great harp here with Jerry playing on an acoustic pick up...The sound quality is also 5 star.",

      "review_text": "dating the extra Stealin', and arguing for a later date than 2.25 First of all, the extra \"Stealin'\" is the same as the one the Archive calls 7.1.66.  The version you get as track 9 here slices off initial riff-error Jerry makes on the false-start of 7.1.66, but afterwards both versions are identical.  Listen for Jerry's lyric-errors on both verses to confirm this.  This tune was really getting away from him that night!   \n \nRegarding the so-called \"2.25\" set itself, here are two more good reasons to believe it's from at least April '66 (if not July):\n  \n1.) The words to verse three of \"Cold Rain\" on this tape are not \"where she met her fatal doom,\" though that's how they appear on both the 3.25.66  version & on the last verse of the Obray Ramsey recording that the boys are covering.  \n\nHere on \"2.25.66,\" Jerry morphs this line into \"where she sang a fatal tune.\"  Even though this hybrid makes no lyrical sense, you can see Jerry trying to get around the idea that the singer brutally slays his wife in the course of the song.  By 5.19.66, Jerry substitutes \"fateful tune,\" a variation that both avoids the murder idea and makes more lyrical sense.  On this rationale, the \"2.25\" version reads like a bridge between 3.25 and 5.19.66. \n \nOn this logic, July '66 also seems likely, since this lyrical change keeps shifting around.  For example on 7.1.66, it's \"fateful tune.\"  But on 12.1.66, Jerry forgets to change, and reverts somewhat:\"where she met her fateful doom,\" an odd mixture of the original and the recent changes.  So in July, he might've slipped back to \"fatal tune\" even after singing \"fateful tune\" on 5.19.66.  \n\n2.)  IKYR offers more information.  The version here has both the \"hollow log/Frisco\" and \"sun/ backdoor\" verses.  The version from 3.12 does not, repeating the 1st verse instead.  By 5.19 the Frisco/backdoor verses have been added, and stay put in all subsequent live versions of the tune.  So there is no way this tape can be before 3.12.66.    \n\nApril is doubtful: why would we have only one set from a Longshoreman's show?  July is likely--end of May at the very least.",

      "review_text": "s/be March 12 As we now know from the Rare Cuts & Oddities release--which includes Hey Little One and the King Bee -> Caution combo--3/12/66 is the correct date for this setlist.\n\nOn the Road Again is the same performance as on the So Many Roads box, so the exact date for that track can now be pinpointed, too.\n\nCold Rain in '66 is the same arrangement as '67, but IMHO they haven't fully tapped into its pulse yet--listen to the fully amped version from Monterey.\n\nHey Little One is just a gem. Beautiful song, and impassioned vocals by Jerry. How rare to hear Jerry belting it out over a girl!  It's my favorite cut on Rare Tracks & Oddities, and~ along with In the Pines & the early Nobody's Fault But Mine~ the most significant buried nugget unearthed from the '66 archives, to my taste. \n\nThis Caution is treasure, too--sort of an extendo Emergency Crew version whose rhythm really does evoke the train-on-the-tracks motif that per Phil's book he & Billy were going for.  Later versions got more intense, with Phil letting the bass notes sustain out & fill the bottom, but this is still priceless. \n\n5 stars for historical value (and I can't get enough '66, keep the excavations coming), but in fairness to the truly best of Dead performances, I'm calling this a 4.\n\nA sidenote on the \"fatal tune\" phrase from Cold Rain:  Jerry sings \"fatal tune\" on the RFK 6/14/91 version.  Thanks for the history on that, I'd just assumed Jerry was having a little fun on the latter, when he was actually hearkening back to days of yore!  (I've now heard the original recording--what a haunter....and what an inspired re-arrangement the Dead came up with....)",

Oh and the sound quality is CD quality. Had Pig Pen lived longer, the dead sound would have included much more of the blues.\n\nThe top 4 songs here, IMO, are Next Time You See Me, Hey Little one, She's on the Road again, and like echoed King Bee -> Caution.  Just listen to the very first riff in Next Time You See Me... wow.\n\n\nHere is something I don't get, from what I looked up, \"Hey Little One\" was first produced by Glen Cambell and released in 1968... so, how is the Grateful Dead singing it in 1966?",

And in a strange twist of fate, this was the very first cassette tape that I was given when I began to get into the band more seriously back in 1986. I always thought it was pretty neat. Of course now I am sure that this is not actually from my birthday.\n\nThere was allegedly an acid test in Hollywood on this date at The Cinema Theatre according to the Wikipedia. I am no expert, but it seems likely to me that the band played there that night at some point. However, it was also generally true that the acid tests took place on Saturdays and this was a Friday night in 1966, so that could be a confusion as well. \n\nThere does seem to be consensus from the vault masters that this music is in fact the Danish Center show from 3-12-66 as there seem to be an even better version of it in the vault after the discovery of the so-called mystery reels in 2006.\n\nIf you want to read about all of that in rather fine detail, this is a good link:\n\nhttp://deadessays.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-1966-mystery-reels-guest-post.html",

The Dead are simply on with every single track, and nail it consistently.  It's hard for me to believe that this is a live recording, and I Know You Rider and Cold Rain and Snow far surpass the 1965 studio recordings.\n\nThere is a palpable energy in the old blues-era live recordings, a real feeling that anything and everything might happen in a show.  It may have been the acid, it may have been the youth, or it might just be something in the tape.  Whatever it is, it's absolutely addicting, and makes for an excellent listening experience.\n\nThere's a slight skip near the end of track 10 from whatever CD this was ripped from.\n\nAll in all, this is amazing.  If this really is a show from March 1966, as the consensus seems to be, it's nothing short of remarkable.  It's hard to believe that this is a live recording.",

It\u2019s brimming with novelty, excitement, and a sunny glance ahead into the enormous untapped future that was just ahead of the Grateful Dead.\n\nBill Kreutzmann already had complete mastery of his instrument. This is an incredible exhibition of his early work. Jerry, Bob, and Phil had serious chops, but were really only just getting started with electric guitars and bass. Their playing is punchy and fast, but mostly stays direct, and within a lane, unlike the melty sidewinding and shapeshifting they would implement later in the 60\u2019s. Pig adds that cheerful organ that stamps this show as being unmistakably 1966. As of 2023, some of these songs are still performed by the remaining guys. \n\nThis one is near and dear to me. Back in the day I ripped it to my iPod Nano, and would bump it on the bus on the way to hockey games, then eventually on the greyhound trips to college, etc. etc. Nowadays I have it as filler on a CD of a longer show. \n\nIn the days and hours before attending a show, I usually listen to stuff from way back in the day, just to appreciate the roots of what I\u2019m about to witness. The day before heading down to Bobby\u2019s Capitol Theatre shows this past weekend, I listened to this one on archive.org through my single ear headset, sipping some English breakfast tea at my desk in an upstate office. 57 Februarys later, many worlds have come since 2/25/66, but it will always hold up as an acid test time capsule and a true classic. \n\n\"The road of life is a long, long road when you walk alone\nBut I found you, and I found a love, a love I never known.\"",
