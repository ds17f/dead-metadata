These shows were just warm ups to the end of the month, as everyone knows, but the Box o' Rain is a wonderful, wonderful version and the Foolish Heart is probably the best one out there--really:  Just listen to the beginning intro. to the song...When you have the headphones on with this one, you can hear the Billy and Mickey come in individually onto the beat (actually one is even on the odd beats for the first four bars or so, and then so slightly blends right in on the snare and bass rythem).  Epic!  Jerry flubs once or twice on the song, but it is a monster of a version and Phil is just going on this one too...worth the price of admission just to hear that beginning over and over again.",

It was the first time I ever went to a concert alone, leaving my ticketless friend at the motel to tape the show on the radio. My original (and worn-out) tape has an interview with Mickey and I think Bobby during intermission. They knew they were much more on than the 18th. The stems I ate kicked in a little early, during Deal, and 4 min. into intermission I was nervously asking someone how long they'd been off stage. Not a good sign. But once they came back out and opened with Box I was good to go. Foolish Heart surprised me as to how good it could be(and still does) and I remember diamond shaped light patterns bathing the stage during Playin, and the Eyes...well, you just have to listen to it. That jam at the end... \n I played this tape at work once and a customer commented on how great the music was and then asked \"who is this?\" His response was\"This is the Grateful Dead? To think what I've missed all these years.\"\n Yeah, yeah, everyone loves the later shows this tour, but I thought this was a smoker.\n And my buddy Still curses me for being there for the China Doll.",

Anyone at this one might remember the ridiculous buzz (you know how lot-talk can be!!) that the Dead were going to bust St. Stephen out this night (the last East Coast one was in Hartford), that they'd been practicing, waiting, etc. et al., ad nauseum. Of course it didn't happen (the tension was THICK during space and you could the crowd deflate when Jer started China Doll) but we were gifted with a tight thick show which was very well played and had some nice moments. A faster 80s-ish Eyes into drums at a time they were opening 2nd sets with it. And the China Doll was pretty great too. Had the FMs for some time.",

Second set is fantastic. Phil opens with Box and his Base is Heavy all through the set especially Foolish Heart which is one of my favorites. Might give a slight edge to 3-28 Nassua though. Nice 80's style fast paced Eyes into the Drums. Out of Space  China Doll-Gimme Some Lovin-GDTRFB-Around And Aound is killer. After Brents Death you never got those high energy post Drumz segments. Brokedown Encore capps of a great show. Hartford had good sound  To Bad the boys were banned from some of those smaller areanas like Hartford and Hampton",

Whole night rocked up until we were sent home to the sweet sound of Brokedown Palace :)  One of those nights that made me happy I went to shows to the very end of the run instead of \"retiring\" after getting out of college in '80.  Wife stayed home and taped the WHCN broadcast for me.  Got home and she was sooooo pissed at me for going with a friend and leaving her behind.

      "review_text": "A gift from heaven This show wasn't originally part of the Spring Tour as announced by GDTS.  It was added later, and word came through a friend that the tickets would be on sale at the Hartford Civic Center box office.  I live in CA, so we called a friend in CT to go and try to get us tickets.  She was a stay-at-home mom with two small children, but she happily volunteered to go down and try to get us tickets for the two shows.  She didn't know what she was in for...\n\nAfter arriving at the Civic Center, which was adjoined by an indoor mall, she went inside the mall with the kids to stay warm, it being a chilly winter day in Hartford.  After loitering around the box office area for a while, some other Deadheads began to show up, and pretty soon a StaffPro yellowjacket came out to throw everyone out of the area. He was pretty effective in clearing out the area, but our intrepid friend remained behind with the kids and tried to blend in.  She was approached directly by the StaffPro guy and asked what she was doing, and she said she was waiting for Grateful Dead tickets.  He then very rudely ejected her from the area.  But our story does not end here.....\n\nOur despondent friend found a pay phone and called us, and we talked her into sticking it out a little longer.  She marched back off into the cold to complete her mission. \n\nPretty soon they formed a line outside of the box office to sell tickets, and our friend got a place in line about halfway back.  At this point the StaffPro guy comes back, looking specifically for our friend.  He apologizes for his rudeness, and takes her and the kids to the front of the line, and inside the box office out of the cold.  She buys the first four tickets off the top of the stack for each night, front row directly in front of Jerry.  Unbelievable, but the truth.\n\nWe were floored.  Then to top it off the shows were first class.  Thank you, Jerry.",

These guys were living in the bushes and selling fake acid and in general destroying all the good vibes they could.\n I'm fairly well-seasoned in the grim and rancid realities of life on Planet Earth, but even this cynical, grizzled Dead Head was emotionally shook up to be conned by fellow scene-lovers. \n Actually, they were pretty slick. I had one of those long 15-tape zippered portable cases slung over my shoulder, and they managed to nab the tapes from it while I was trustfully talking to them.\n So here it is, sixteen years later and I've got my music back.

A very average first set was followed by an above-average second, thanks to a very nice Eyes-Jam-Drumz-Space-China Doll.  I don't agree that this is \"the best\" Foolish Heart ever, and find that better versions of many of these songs were played at Nassau Coliseum 3/28-3/30.  Still I enjoyed the second set and if you like this time period you will too.",

      "review_text": "I was here!...great night! This night, mentioned by the reviewer below, was fabled as the \"they are playing St. Stephen' show. It was because of the lore asociated with Hampton just 5 months earlier. In fact, I recall spending the night outside of the Hartford Civic center on a raw and cold night in early March or maybe late February and sleeping out for tickets- which were not even on sale yet. There was a rumor that this show would be billed as the Warlocks. A group of us all in some form of transition from highschool to college in various community colleges in New England, gathhered and then went to Hartford, decended on the civic center, and were convinced that tickets for \"the warlocks' were going on sale. We told the staff \"it is going tobe a suprise release you do not even know about it yet...its in the computers...\"..we were wacked thinking tix were goign on sale. Eventually we drew staff with red jackets and bull horns yelling \"there will be no tix here for sale of the warlocks, nor no grayful dead peformance..\"...\"please clear the mall\"... \n\nThe local staff was in awe and the line grew, and we even had a guy with a clip board taking names...(again, we were 19 then)...so the tickets never went on sale that night but we 'dropped' and stayed in line anyway and hoarsed around for like 8 hours in downtown hartford. When we disbanded we learned a week or two later that in fact tix were on sale, and this show was in the spot in the vacant 3 day period of the already published spring tour. The show rips..it really was tight..I was on the floor and had gone to Landover for the first two nights there and was stoked for these two. This copy of the show is better in that phil's voice is more blended with the sound- in the other one posted, sound is still great, yet not as well mixed- phil is way too loud, which is why I prefer this. The show is a 5 star 1990 jamfest- do not cheat yourself out of drums and space! PLayin jam is right out of '76...slim and slinky yet raw and stealthy. Enjoy them all and God bless the dead and Jerry Garcia...",

I was driving and it was , ok , where is the nearest pay phone. Leaving messages on answering machines, see we did survive without cell phones it would have made it alot easier but I guess that was part of the fun. Meet me here and there, go here at such and such. To me life is too predictable without The Dead!\nGreat show, I might be the only person on planet Earth that likes Picasso Moon? This one is real good.Anybody that thinks Brent stunk needs to listen to this All Over Now and get back to us! A great Bertha,Jack A Roe,Brown Eyed Women and Deal. Second starts with a great Box of Rain.Foolish Heart,Eyes and China Doll are awesome. I just love China Doll one of my top 10 Jerry songs and this one does not disappoint!\n\nAdding on 8/31/10 that after a few listens on the Ipod that this is the finest electric Jack-A-Roe ever.........",

I remember the boys were on that night.  I brought my brotha to his first show and I remember him being wrapped up in a blanket telling me that he thinks he is floating.  The scene was a little weird with city parking but I was able to find a nice little parking area that had many good reliable heads who were there for the show not the scene. \n\nSecond set was tight with the Box/Foolish kickin.  The China Doll out of space was a treat and the Brokedown Palace brought tears to my eyes.  Two days after the show I hooked up with the tape off of the radio broadcast but as we know tapes were tapes. \n\nI remember driving back to MA. after the show and picking up a hitchiker who would not stop talking.  I turned to him and said, \"dude, I am trying to concentrate here\" because the weather was rainy and the driving crappy.\n\nThose were the days.  Peace",

      "review_text": "Words half spoken and thoughts unclear! Sorry folks, for all those five stars out there I had to put some balance in here.\n\nThis is a good show but by no means five stars.  Bucket is ok, Bertha is good, We can run is so-so, the ending is bad/unreheased, or rehearsed and then forgotten live.  Same goes for Picasso's ending.  The rest of the first set is maybe four stars at best.\n\nOk, Box is good but, not great, and here comes the wierd part.  I don't know how high you have to be to rate this Foolish as \"best\", it is clearly not.  Missed lyrics all over the place, and an uninspired jam at the end do not make it even close to five star.  Again the rest of the set is at best four stars.  Good but not great.\n\nIn my opinion, ANY missed lyrics and sloppy endings immediately take a show down to four stars.  Even if you were there, I'm sorry, I just can't agree.  \"We can run but, we can't hide from it!\"\n\nI'm giving this show three stars again just to balance out the truth!

Maybe someone who knows more about music can tell me is that Brent or Jerry doing those amazing sounds? It sounds like Brent on keys but I am not sure. It is easily one of the best things in 1990 - I am not exaggerating about this. Also Foolish Heart is great and an EXCELLENT Bertha. Pretty much every March 1990 show is good as far as I've gotten.",

In terms of what the band had built towards since 1988. A \"lean rock 'n' roll sound\" as Garcia put it in some interview. but really that was such a modest way to put it. \n\nThe Foolish Heart is simply the best ever. Next to maybe 88.7.2, and 90.7.12... Sure Jer flubs a few words, but the end jam really show colour and creativity from especially Jerry, Phil, and Brent. \n\nYou gotta love where they were going with this lineup. So sad Brent went when he did. Imagine how much more focused they could have gotten if it wern't for certainly unfortunate elements. \n\nHartford 90. A Great show.",

      "review_text": "All over the place This show is just 4 days prior to one of my all timers at the knick, and during a few segments this show had the same feel. I enjoyed the good time vibe I felt during several of the tunes. Although this show had it moments and I would have loved to see it live, as a whole it really came up short. I find that I have the same feeling about many, many latter era shows \u2013 The feeling of identifying with the crowd and thinking about how fun it was/would have been, but then I put my review hat on and my honest objective-as-I can-be opinion is different. So, on to the show. \n\nFirst set opens with Helen, which was well done and the crowd really went nuts for this relatively solid opener. For the time, Im sure this killed every time they opened with it. Next up is another relatively well done tune in Bertha. Jerrys vocals are sounding good and when Brent jumps in on the chorus the house went nuts. Nice energy boys \u2013 try and keep that shit up. Uh-oh, now you guys have gone and done it \u2013 We Can Run. That tremendous sucking sound you hear at the beginning of this one is every bit of energy and momentum hauling ass outta the arena. Why? Goddamit why must they do shit like this? The remarkable part is how Jerry gets them right back with a very well done Jack-a-Roe\u2026I love me some Jack-a-Roe and I saw it more than once live and dug it every damn time. When I hear it I have wonderful memories flood my little brain. Bravo Jerome! OK, large amount of suck on deck again with Picasso. I know saying that is slightly harsh but I hate this song. Ok, enough about Picasso. ALSO, I will make the point that I do give these shows complete listens meaning even songs such as this I never bump. Takes some discipline fo sho\u2026Anyhows, a very tranquil Brown Eyed comes next and it was kinda weak. We need a little more outta Jer for this to work. Someone grab the stun gun and give him a shot\u2026Brown eyed slides right into another well done song in All Over Now. Always dug it and this one does not disappoint. We round out the set with an average Deal and Im thinking this show has a nice good-timey feel but is kinda all over the place so far. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed it \u2013 but only to a point. \n\nThe second set starts with a very well done Box opener and continues right on without stopping into a surprisingly well done Foolish. Not a fan of Foolish but Jerry kept my attention on this one. Next is my favorite part of the sequence and the show being Playin\u2019>Eyes. I found myself literally wound up several times during these two. Stopping what I was doing and just thinking they were tearing some shit up here, especially around the 6 minutes mark of Playin gets really good. I was really impressed with Phil and Jerry doing what they were doing. Phil seemed to own Playin and Eyes had its own kinda thing that was a little speedy and really heavy\u2026.Again, this part of the segment had my full attention. Very nice little drift into Drums and Space, and then The China Doll on the way out did nothing for me. Nothing. Jerry almost sounded bored to me. Hey that\u2019s just me though. I though Gimme Some sucked giant balls and GDTRFB waas really hopped up and nice. Not real impressed with Round&Round, and I really dug Brokedown just cause its Brokedown. \n\nSo, where do I stand now just finishing this one. A little disappointing really. Moments of brilliance and wonderful charisma coupled with some real dogshit \u2013 which I am not saying in a loving way today. The first set gave me many pleasant memories of shows I have seen, yet that is not enough to make me recommend this one. My enjoyment of the second set was limited as well, so \u2013 I give this effort a C, mainly on the strength of the good-timey vibe going on for most of the show. Classic 1990 right here - not the greatest, and not the worst.",

Give him a listen on Deal, PITB->Eyes, and of course Box. Check out Brent on It's All Over Now and Jack-a-Roe. Love me a 77 version of the latter, but there's really something about these late-era Brent versions. Some lyrical flubs in the Foolish Heart, but the playing from its start through PITB to Eyes (check it out especially around 10 mins on) as it meanders through drums and space into China Doll is special. First of only four China Dolls in 1990. \"It\u2019s a tender song in every way\u2014things have been fractured, but perhaps they can be, in some sense, salvaged\" (David Dodd, Greatest Stories Ever Told - \"China Doll\"). Out of this brooding version, Brent and Phil team up to sing Gimme Some Loving as if responding to the despair. Blues medley continues with GDTRFB and Around and Around. Brokedown Palace to bid Hartford farewell. Off and onward to Ontario!",

With the Hartford Whalers hockey team in the civic center, it became hard for the boys to get two-night stands in Hartford- but the Dead took a one-night stand and hell, let's air it live! What band would do that?  So, cue the cassette recorders at home and sit back. My recording has the night DJ chiming in to say \" you are listening to the Grateful Dead, live at the Hartford Civic Center\" in a golf-announcer whisper. So, of course I love this show- the setlist is really quite good- with many highlights mentioned in other reviews. Box of Rain>Foolish Heart is awesome. The band loved to play Hartford because of the audience response; Jerry does a classic solo jam reprise solo in Foolish Heart and the audience was along for the ride. I miss WHCN and even more-- Jerry Garcia and special shows like this. ",
