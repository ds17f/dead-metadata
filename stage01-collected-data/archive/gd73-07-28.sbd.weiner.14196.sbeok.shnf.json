In essence, that meant that on July \n28, one out of every 350 people living in America at the time was listening to \nthe sounds of rock at the New York state racetrack. Considering that most of \nthose who attended the even hailed from the Northeast, and that the average age \nof those present was approximately seventeen to twenty-four, close to one out of \nevery three young people from Boston to New York was at the festival.\"\n\nThis newly patched recording starts will Bill Graham's introduction, which until this latest listen I'd never heard before. The sound quality is good to nearly great, but there is some static and other noise (I think of this sort of analog noise as \"the crunch\") that will bug most listeners, but shouldn't prevent them from enjoying a really fine performance by the Grateful Dead. \n\nThere's a ton of highlights beyond the Allman's sitting in, the Playing is superb throughout it's 24 minute span. Loose Lucy is slow and heartfelt. He's Gone is just great.\n\nThe China Cat> I Know You Rider, Stella Blue, Eyes, Sugar Magnolia would make a great show all by themselves. \n\nThe soundcheck the night before tends to get a lot more attention that the actual show, and I don't dispute that jugement, but this deserves a good strong listen.",

Camped early afternoon. Could hear the Friday evening jam from camp. Walked to concert site at 2 AM Sat, settled at back of crowd about 150 yards from stage center and crashed for a few hours.  Woke up at sunrise totally surrounded by miles and miles and miles of stoned out hippie humanity.  Probably one of the greatest moments of my life.  And then the music starts-it was glorious.  Accept this music as the historical document that it is.  Sound and minor performance flaws just add to the authenticity.  No Gold Circle seating here, just a majestic musical performance from a long time ago. Yea, AND IT WAS GLORIOUS.",

Arrived there and camped out on Mount Blanc and then next day headed back down and stuck my thumb out for Watkins Glen! Arrived early in the morning and walked the five miles from town to the concert site, there were freaks everywhere! Tipped toed over numerous sleeping bodies to within 50 yards of the stage and woke up the next morning to Jerry's soulful guitar. The next few hours were filled with the most amazing live music I've ever heard. And yes, they all jammed at the end, is there a recording of it somewhere? All I know is that this is one of my most treasured memories. I think the 60's really ended at Watkins Glen that weekend ah me!......",

China>Rider is horrendous. Jerry is as sloppy as ever and not in that loose(but tight) way.  The main drawback of this show is that unlike most of 72-74 jerry and phil don't seem to have that telekinetic interplay going on.  A lot of what they're playing doesn't mix well together which equates to a bunch of pointless noodling.  Eyes was alright, but for me its in the bottom of any '73-'74 versions.\n\nIn the context of '73 this show deserves a 2 star rating, based on the poor performance of many songs and the sound quality. With the historical context and in relation to post-hiatus dead it might get a 3.  '73 is my favorite year and i have probably 30 shows from it so I think I have some bearing on this show(please don't take this as elitist). Check out 2-15, 3-24, 5-26, 6-22, 6-26, 10-25, 10-30, 11-11, 11-10, 11-30, 12-6, i guess basically anything spring or fall.  oh, dick's picks 19 as well from the 10-19 show.\n\nI love the dead as much as anyone, but looking to reviews on here is pointless if every show gets a 4 or 5.  I'm happy for you if you had a great time at this show and got lost in space, but even people writing reviews here are saying they don't remember the music, yet they give it a 4 or 5.  A lot of reviews on archive give most musically versed and objective deadheads a bad name.\n\nSorry for the rant",

This was the largest gathering of humanity in the history of the US.  It was larger than Woodstock.  We got there before just before \"The Band\" started playing.  I wanted to go down front.  I got a great spot in front of the mixer tower.  I turned around and my friends were gone.  In my hurry to get a good viewing spot, I lost them.  Somebody gave me a four way hit of sunshine, and the rest is history.  When the Dead started playing ....Jerry got everybody up on their feet with his genius ability to stir the soul, and the giant wall of speakers spoke clearly to the audience.  The Dead were kickin' our ass!\nIn a sea of 600,000 people, my childhood friend Mark Giegerich spots me hunched over underneath a sheet of plastic ducking out of the rain.  We both find our way back to my car after the show, because he lost his friends too.  Mark's brother AJ, it turns out was the stage manager at Woodstock. With AJ's influence I got a job at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic NJ. Never in my life would I imagine that 4 years later I would be working for the Grateful Dead on tour. My friend Cy Kocis, along with Roger Judge and myself, were the official catering company on tour with the Grateful Dead.  I just got the Watkins Glen board tapes on CD and am reliving the show.  I sat with Jerry one night on tour back in 1978 and asked him about the song Big River.  We both agreed that song is the one that you need to find the best sound system available to you ...and well, crank it up.  At the time he was talking quadrophonic.  Does anybody remember that?! God bless Jerry and the fine work the band and crew has done all of these many years. We miss Jerry and we miss those days.  There will never be another band to equal this quantity of talent and spirit. As Steve Parrish once said, the greatest band on the planet, bar none.",

We arrived on Wednesday afternoon, and amazingly, our last ride was about 35 miles from WG, from a girl who actually lived a few blocks from us in Oxford who was going there as well! Anyway, it was a great time. It was also a trying experience since we were not expecting to be part of one of the largest cities in the country at the time, but the situation called for us to forge on. With the help of the entrepreneurs that were selling anything you could want, we got through the tough stuff.\nWe went into the concert area early on Friday and established our \"spot\" about 60 yards back from the stage, nearly in the center.\n\nBut here's where what I remember that differs from what I've read:\nThe Band came out on Friday (disguised as a soundcheck) after the Dead and the Allmans played forEVER and played their asses off. With much anticipation, I waited. Here's what I remember... they played half of WS Walcott's Medicine Show and walked off the stage. That was IT -- DONE -- FINITO! Less than three minutes of total performance time and they were done. Dead logged at least two hours. Allmans played nearly the same amount of time. The Band... about 2:30 and they were done. PISSED ME OFF! But not as much as that album they CALL live at Watkins Glen. Sorry guys.. that was NOT recorded at WG.\n\nBut I digress... It was an amazing experience and I honestly remember nearly every bit of the trip hitching TO the show, and not a bit of the trip back to Oxford. Good music is magic... and wears you OUT!\n\nThanks to all involved for putting this up there for the rest of us to enjoy! If you were there, you know...",

We just sat down and stayed put for the next 24 hours.\n\nAt one point, my buddy Dave went to find the john and couldn't find his way back for 4 hours.\n\nThe rest is really fuzzy, but somehow on Sunday morning I woke up in the back of my friend's car, parked in front of his nearby aunt's house, who invited us in and made us breakfast. I remember barely being able to speak, but somehow managed to keep it together enough to say thanks. Later that day we were back in NJ getting reamed by my dad.\n\nThe whole thing changed my life. The Dead played ALLLL afternoon, taking us all on a musical journey to new heights. A great set. It was my first Dead show and I became a fan for life right there.",

From what I've heard this show has some great moments, and I can see how if you were there this could be an amazing experience, recordings rarely do justice compared to the experience of being there and having the music live with you in the moment. Sometimes I'll have a show for 2 years in my collection, listen to it here or there, think its not that great or only hear some great parts, but then one day I'll listen to it and the whole show will hit me as an incredibly naturally flowing musical experience, the jai franton shows are a good expample of this, I think sometimes with certain 73-74 shows you have to be in the right mood and contribute some energy to it for it to work. 4 stars is my rating but that could change any day",

It's a bit like comparing peaches and nectarines, but I will say that everyone is playing better in 1973, particularly Billy, Phil and Keith.  This is also a good show (for acid), particularly from China Cat on + Here Comes Sunshine which is excelente. \n However, Jerry's voice and actual guitar are more effective for me in 1977. There is no Saint Stephen and Morning Dew at Watkins Glen either. So, it's hard to say.\nDo you like Lincoln, NE 2/26/73 more than Fox Theater 5/19/77?",

Grateful Dead, The Band and Allman Brothers!\"  All legendary bands in that age.  The problem was the concert was 240 miles from suburban Franklin Lakes, NJ and neither of us had a ticket.  But to two rock-blind teenagers, that wasn't an obstacle.  We grabbed a couple of sleeping bags, headed for the highway and stuck our thumbs in the air.  Back then, hitch-hiking was just another form of transportation.  Surprisingly, we made it to the town of Watkins Glen in just three rides, the last one in a smoky Dodge van with some very generous stoners.  Traffic came to a grinding halt about 5 miles from the speedway.  Everyone just pulled over and started walking.  Naive as we were, Frank and I were planning our break-in along the way.  We came up with a half dozen cockamamie schemes for sneaking in - really stupid stuff like finding a hole in the fence or  just climb over when no one is looking - when we suddenly realized that we were already in the speedway grounds.  No sneaking or skulking necessary!  The next two days were pubescent paradise!  Righteous music, plentiful smoke and tits everywhere.  We nearly starved to death and toward the end, were pretty dehydrated.  But we didn't even notice until we started heading back home.  To be honest, I don't even remember hitch-hiking back.  I caught hell from my folks when I got home.  I told them I was going camping with Frank, but my younger brother, who I made the mistake of confiding in, ratted me out.  But it was worth every bit of the lectures and the grounding for the stories I had going into my senior year and the local fame I garnered as one of the few attendees.  I'll never forget that trip (well, what I actually remember of it).  One of my most memorable experiences!",

Her grandfather was a retired Greyhound bus mechanic, and he had been teaching me mechanics and woodworking. To prepare for the trip, we rebuilt his bus and made a sleeping platform with storage bins. We had to order all the maps from the American Automobile Association to plan the routes. \nAfter two days of driving around the Great Lakes in the hardest rain we had ever seen, we arrived at Watkins Glen Racetrack in NY to see the Dead. Coming from the north wwe were able to drive right to the racetrack. We heard the Friday soundcheck and then left just before the rain started. We weren't going to relive the Woodstock experience. Today is the first time I'm ;istening to the recording and it's just how I (barely) remember that day. Rough, perfunctory song versions with a couple nice jams.\nI am often reminded of that summer these days; it was the summer Watergate became a word describing unthinkable levels of political corruption.",

He said this was so because the drugs didn't mix well (\"The Bad was drunk, Dead tripping, and Allman Bros. coked out.\") I've listened to this a few times, and completely disagree. WHile there is plenty more to the show - namely the China>Rider, Playin', and Eyes - as an ABB fan, the Mountain Jam is what caught my eye first, and I think that Trucks in crazy. While I may understand where he's coming from, as it sounds like the Dead's take on the Mountain Jam, not necessarily the same thing as the famed ABB version from the Fillmore East in 1971, it is nonetheless DOPE. I would highly recommend that anyone who likes the Allman Bros. and the Dead go listen to this, but first listen to the DS>Spanish Jam>Lovelight from 2/11/70",

It's a very flat sounding matrix, but Winamp allows you to tweak this yourself somewhat. \nI noticed in listening to this it's obvious it took about 3 minutes into Bertha for the sound tech to even begin getting a good mix -- the drums are mostly absent in the first half, and it takes that long for those at the soundboard to even solve that problem. Interesting mix of sources. I don't think this is the best day the band ever had by a long shot -- it's hard to play well in front of enormous crowds -- but the historic factor is fascinating and it's a great shout-out to Watkins Glen, which I grew up not too far away from.

I dare any reviewer from past reviews that put this show down or any other show down to write the same put down today 7/28/25 or beyond. Every show they did is really good.
