I flew down from AK to see the five shows in the PNW and it was the best decision of my touring life. Seattle was unseasonably hot (ironically, it was over 85 today!) and the perfect setting for a three day extravaganza.  All three nights were good, but  Friday was otherworldly at times. The beginning of the second set smoked in a way that I had not heard since 91.  Jerry was using some crazy effects in the extended Fire that make it one of my favorite late versions of this song.\nAn exceptional show from the band in it's final days. Listening to it today I am so thankful to have had such a wonderful experience in the city I now call home.\nThe sound quality is good, not great and the levels are low, likely due to the analog gen.",

I have listened to this scarlet-fire countless times and never get bored of it. Why?   Because Jerry went places in this Fire that he has never visited before and we all know Jerrys been \"out there beyond the cosmos many times before\" In fact, I was so curious about Jerry's exploration in this tune (weird string bending stuff)that I went back and listen to shows before and after this one to see if he had been doing these weird sounds and yes; listen to the Portland shows and you'll notice in several songs including the Terrapin him doing what he did in this Fire.  Oh...BTW...I remember reading in Relix Magazine that they too rated this show as one of the top shows in 95...glad I saw it....I'll never forget seeing all the smoke rising from the crowd when that scarlet-fire started....",

The day of 5/25 I said \"What the hell am i doing? Jerry is playing in Seattle, get your ass down and see him.\" It was a voice of necessity in my head and later I understood why. I bought tix at the stadium and the 25th was quite surprisingly fun for me and got me eerily excited for the next eve. The spring PNW weather was beautiful that 3 day run. From Help/Slip/Franklins opener of 5/26 and I knew it was going to be a good night. I couple was married next to us on the floor phil's side at set break. The Scarlet>Fire seriously caught my attention. Jerry was lovin it. But the Party highlight of the night (and this may not come accross on tape) was the Good Lovin' the stadium was a popcorn machine with all the happy heads dancin their asses off. Smiles all around. I remember seeing people hanging out of their apartment windows in lower Queen Anne looking into the stadium watchin' all of us rockin out. It was party that couldn't be ignored in the neighborhood and we were happily keepin up the neighbors. Lookin back I'm so happy I made that decision on the 25th. It was a great note to end my decade with the boys. Thanks Jerry!\n\nSidenote: Fittingly for my last GD show, this show was on the eve of Memorial Day Weekend in Memorial Stadium.",

      "review_text": "\"Seattle On Fire\" This is IMO the last show the Grateful Dead pulled out the \"Magic\" before we lost Jerry. I loved this venue and was fortunate enough to catch the Dead ther 5 times. each time was special and especially this particular show. It was a beautiful spring day in Seattle and Grateful Dead magic was in the air. I stayed at the Best Western accross the street and peering out the window in my room i could see the Space Needle and the Memorial Coliseum stands and excitement was to bee seen everywhere. The streets around the Seattle center were filled with heads walking and dancing around and you knew something special was about to happen. The Memorial Coliseum was a small outdoor venue with two grand stands flanking each other and a small field area just enough room to fit a football field ala high scholl size. The set up was beautiful with the Canvas sails hung up on the stage depicting daybreak to sundown. Behind the stage area was a row of tall pines that could be seen swaying with the cool seattle breezes as the Jerry & Gang rocked the whole place out. Now I know I'm beeing biased here since this was the 3rd to last time I saw the Dead and it being one of my favorite shows out the 60 I saw from 1981 to 1995 but believe me this is one awesome ahow. From the first notes of Help On The way things were getting stretched out and wierd. Bobby's guitar hand a changleing kind of effect when he was strumming it and Jerry and Phil both took it to another level. Hell even Vince Welnick who I really didn't care much for because of the way he used to drown out Jerry or interupt Jerry's solo with his brashness on the keyboard sounded like he was in sync with the rest of the band, just the right touch and stepping in when it really was his turn LOL. Franklin's Tower was next and Jerry emphasized \"I want you to ROLL AWAY!! the dew.\" and the set the tone for the rest of the show. You couldn't help but fell that all things didn't matter and the only thiong left was to put a shitty grin on your face and start grooving to the music like your life depended on it. Same Thing was played to perfection and Loose Lucy had everybody go into overdrive only to take you into another world with Eternity. I love the way they played Eternity with that snakey feel to it, very nice indeed. willy dixon had to be proud of the way the boys palyed that song, it just had that feel to it. The first was rapped up with a nice Don't Ease and we were all able to catch our second wind before the next set.  what happened next is waht I really mean by Magic. The whole second set represented what i would say is a collective input from many years of being the Good Ol' Grateful Dead. Past and present was molded into one and the end result was far out into the stratosphere and beyond this galaxy. You got to listen to this Scarlet-Fire with all it's great guiter work from Jerry,Phil and Bob. this is the trippiest verasion out there IMO. Jerry pulls out his magic \"Wand\" and right away it starts congering up images of killer whales flying out of Puget Sound and twirling in the air above the Memorial Coliseum, the white stripe on their saly wet underbellies changing into every color one could imagine. Yes folks music can project you into a higheer conciousness and this is a good example of just that. The playing- Uncle was paired up nicely before drums and the Space had your attention. Easy answers shredded through your body and then jerry put you down to a floating stream with the stella Blue. Good Lovin made you want to dnace all night and day and the Liberty closer was appropriate enough being we were in Seattle. The heads and the citizens of Seattle have always been voicing their concern over many things regarding the city, the ecology and local politics. Liberty should be the city's song LOL. Please stream this show and enjoy the the \"Magic\"",

I just cleaned up the writing a bit from last week so don't feel the need to read if you've already been here.\n\nWhat gets my goat is the raving about this Seattle '95 show that also opens with Help>Slip>Frank. Okay, raving is a bit strong I know (as is \"gets my goat\"), but I was at this show, loved it at the time but have never felt it held up on tape or Ipod or whatever you youngsters listen to the Dead  on these days. In fact this show is  kind of embarrassing because we all thought it so righteous at the time. . There are other shows in '95 that are better (Spring Tour) and yet this show is singled out as the the best. I threw it on last week to be sure. Maybe I'll compare. Or maybe I'll just throw on a show from '72. Yeah, that sound like a good idea.\n\nHere's an update:  I don't \"hate\" the 90's.  I think 90-91 was a peak time for the band.  There are many shows from 92-94 I rate highly.  Even the Estimated from the first night of this run is superb IMHO)and comes out of nowhere!  I have been playing almost exclusively '94-95 the last few weeks.  Does this sound like an 90's hater?  I like looking for those moments where Garcia pokes his head up through the cloud and suddenly is present from this era much the same way I like later Charlie Parker records.  I too would rather be at this show than at no show.  I think I told you all that I truly enjoyed myself at this show.  But Scarlet>Fire and Help>Slip!>Frank dive-bombed in '95.  Garcia couldn't bluff those songs.  He certainly plays a better Fire here than on previous '95 occasions, but to rate it as others have done as the best show of the year discounts the Spring Tour that I feel was really his last gasp.    \n\nI love all Grateful Dead eras and have even added some '95 stuff to my collection in the last two weeks and will no doubt add more of this run (I was at all three shows and Portland) and the previous Seattle run (and Autzen '94 too---Hey Autzen '94 third night---compare the Fire's and you tell me if I'm wrong about all this.  That being said I still play this show from time to time.  But I ain't gonna change my rating.  And really guys, I'm not out to hurt anyone's feelings.  I know there are some real nasty dudes on this site who aren't exactly subtle and can be pretty insulting.  I am not one of those guys.\n\nUpdated 4/24/08",

Finally, I'm able to listen to this show.\nAfter 13 years, I was wondering if I'd ever get the chance.\nMy last show.\nWho can account for the effects of time, who were we then?\nwho are we now? I remember that place taking off like a space\nship bound for the far reaches during scarlett-fire, everyone in\nthe place spinnin' and dancing their hearts out. We all knew that\nthat was one of those moments that come from time to time.\nIf you weren't at this show and you listen to it now would you\nknow? Could you tell from just the music what an incredible\nevent of energy and music and spirit was going on at that moment in time. Listening to it now, I don't think so.\nIt was lived 100% in the moment. For all of us,\nfans and musicians, we were purely in the present moment, there was no past and no future. Scarlett-Fire on that day became a portal into that special place we sadly only get to visit\nfrom time to time. That place is pure consciousness, without thought or worry. That's why we loved going to shows. That's why we loved the band, loved the community. When you share moments like that with others, they immediately become family.\nThat moment isn't in the recording, it cant' be.  It was lived in the moment, and now we are on to the next moment and the next........ Inside all this music history though is a finger pointing at the moon. The music is the finger, not to be discarded, but not to be mistaken for the moon either.The light is the beauty of\nthose moments. Their availability and our capacity to experience them is around us all the time. The legacy of the band and the music is that vision, that view of our inherent capacity to live like that: alive, awake, without fear.  Some recordings live and shine\nbecause of musical technique, some shine because of what was going on that day. This show is one of the later, it doesn't make it any less special, but I think it's important to make a distinction.\nWhen you hear the faint roar of the crowd coming to you in tiny bits of digital sound waves and you know some of it is you coming back to you from 13 years ago, does it blow your mind?\nIt blows mine.\nPeace and Love",

All it was missing was a Dark Star with a good space jam or a blazing Dew, or I'd have given it 5.\n\nThis sounds more like a 91 show than a 95.  I'm up to Easy Answers typing this, and so far I haven't heard a single badly played song.  Even starting the first set with the challenging H>S>F, Jerry got most of the words and played the arpeggiated chords at the beginning and end of Slipknot! with only a couple of minor flubs.  His tone was good throughout.  My only quibble was he didn't get into the upper register much during Slipknot!, and Vince didn't do a whole lot either, but it was just the first song.  Jerry and Vince both ratcheted up the intensity during the bluesy Same Thing and continued through the end of the first set.  \n\nLaugh at me all you want, but I like Eternity.  It's a jazz number with keyboard and guitar solos, and Jerry usually came alive for the newer songs even if he mailed in the ones he'd done 600 times.  Vince and Jerry both sparkle on this one.\n\nI think Jerry realized he was on during the set break, because he turned up the volume on his guitar.  What followed was a Scarlet>Fire for the ages.  Seriously, I think I've found a new favorite!  Scarlet is gorgeous and well-played, as is the transition jam, but the real magic comes during Fire.  After a long and blazing first solo, where the band rises up to meet Jerry in spine tingling fashion, Jerry decides to try something different for the second solo, and starts playing slide leads.  At first it seemed like he was just messing around, but he kept it up with more and more intensity going way into the upper register, stopping to play regular picking leads way up on his guitar, and then going back into the sliding.  The band soon picked it up themselves, with Bob and Vince coaxing colorful counterpoint in collaboration.  A magical performance that doesn't have the steady buildup to a titanic climax of 5/8/77, or the well-crafted flow of 3/5/81, but blows the mind in a whole different way.\n\nPlayin' is cooking, but unfortunately very short before Jerry shifts keys.  There's a bit of a \"searching for the sound\" moment before the band settles into a strong Uncle John's Band.  I think Jerry was still having problems playing fast, as he starts to go into a typical fast, \"circular\" as I call it Playin' lead, but isn't hacking it and cuts it off to go into UJB.  Within his limitations, though, he was still capable of driving the band to magical peaks, as would happen again on Stella Blue.  I had to stop typing to listen to the end of that.  I don't care much for Easy Answers, but would have taken that one easily over any of the four Miracles or three Last Times I heard in my eight Vince shows.\n\nBy the way, to the person who said spring 95 was Jerry's last gasp, I was at all three Philly shows, and none was even close to this one.  Maybe the Charlotte shows got this good, if only because of Hornsby.  Also, to LABC, that was not a \"mess;\" that's why they call it space.  And this was a good one, with everyone involved.\n\nI found myself crying after this one ended, because Jerry could still get it done at such a high level so close to the end.  What if he'd taken better care of himself?  What if he'd taken time off, gotten cleaned up, handled the diabetes, gotten a more ergonomic guitar to deal with the carpal tunnel syndrome?  It didn't happen.  This may have been the last truly wonderful Grateful Dead show.",

Sure they might have gotten a bit rusty occasionally but what band doesn't from time to time?  Even the youngest freshest bands have their off days, months, years.  \n\nI love the dead, and in any great relationship you take the bad and the great times, its all just part of the experience :)  I think a lot can be learned about a band when you hear them at their best and at their worst.\n\nThis is a good show, 4 stars in my opinion.  A strong Scarlet>Fire, the boys busting some interesting sounds out during Fire.",

      "review_text": "If you need one nugget from this whole sorry tour... I've been looking for something (anything) redeemable from this tour that can stand on musical merits, as opposed to fond memories, cult worship, or \"after blowing the first verse, Garcia rips into his guitar for a few bars and mostly stays in tune...\" \n\nHonestly?  There is very little music to be found on this tour...  This show?  Better than most, perhaps the best, but all that means is that the band approached competency; the days of blowing minds was long, long passed.  Garcia's vocals, which would be a disgrace coming from anyone else (which makes Garcia's fatal addiction disgraceful), are among his best of the tour.  He gets a good 75% of the verses right, even is in tune here and there.  His guitar approximates the level of a teenage Deadhead attempting to sound like his hero...  Weir and the others has gone from sloppy to slovenly, but bring it back up a notch to sloppy again, the urgency of their situation must have been starting to play on their minds...\n\nAll of which sounds like one big dis, and it is to an extent and the band earned it.  As \"important\" as they are to the fans, they had no business doing this tour; presenting a half-dead Jerry was a ripoff, and it probably cost him his life in the bargain.  I still get a little angry when I think of the '94-'95 Dead; anger at Jerry, anger at the others, anger at the \"organization\" that needed to take the fans' money for this abomination of a tour...\n\n...and having said all of that, the Scarlet  Begonias>>Fire on the Mountain turns out to be the nugget I was looking for.\n\nIt's as shoddy as everything else here, but Garcia manages to pull himself together for two songs' worth of fine playing.  Bum notes fly like beer bottles, but he stays on focus and soars.  Despite the MIDI effects (which I generally disliked, but don't mind here) he actually reminds me of the long-gone Jerry of the 70's; he suddenly discovers new space in these moldy oldies and I was mesmerized; it was as if I hsd never heard the potential in both songs through all these years, and Jerry's very last triumph may well be this segment...\n\nIt's back to business as usual after that, but as noted before, it could have been a lot worse.  And was, most of the time.\n\nIt is such a profound waste that it came down to this.  I still can't take any '95 show from opening note to closing note.  But these songs make better closers for Dead compilation discs, instead of the final Black Muddy River I had been using...  That one is just sad; these actually are...well, musical.",

      "review_text": "My last show I was at this show when I was 10 years old. My family had driven from Vancouver to Seattle the year before to see the Dead in 94. Although this wasn't my first show, this one is the most vivid and memorable for me. I remember most of it so clearly. I remember being so pumped when Set 1 began because I really wanted to hear Franklins Tower. When the show opened with Help on the Way, I knew it would eventually lead to that. Listening to it now makes me smile. As does Scarlet Begonias, Fire on the Mountain, Playing in the Band and Uncle Johns Band. I dare you to listen to this version of Stella Blue without tearing up. We were all choked up with emotion at the time, but it's obviously even more poignant now. Good Lovin was a great big party and I remember all of people in the stadium dancing and twirling. I read everyone else's reviews here and remember lots of other little things too, like the geese flying. I'll always be glad to have experienced this show first hand. These experiences shaped me big time. Thanks to my parents and thanks to the Dead. Love is real, Not fade away. Xo",

      "review_text": "5/24/1995 rememberance I stepped back into the world on May 20, 1995 by way of Ballard WA after a year on a misbegotten journey to the fishing grounds of the Aleutians chasing the dying illusion of freedom and manhood aboard a trawler in the Bering sea. My folly was revealed not long after taking to sea on this ocean-raping vessel but alas, I was young and foolish so I stood fast for that horrid year far beyond the sight of trees. Upon the satisfaction of my contract with SeaTerror Inc. I swore to never again partake in such a horrid disregard for the planet and its occupants.  \nUpon my safe return to Seattle I found myself at last free from my idiotic self-imposed indenture and feeling quite tentative as to how I tread thenceforth, now and forevermore recalling my solemn vow. Upon retrieving my pay packet, all the while divided against myself- good capitalist piglet vs. opportunistic yet determinedly self sufficient  pseudo-hippie, I staggered into the heart of Seattle, the marvel that it was in 1995. Mind you friend, this is pre-global domination Starbucks, Ubiquit-internet, and though our ships' companies HQ was located in Pike Place my only other business there at the time was to retrieve the psilocybe mushroom grow kit to be sought deep within the organs of that touristcentric center. It was therein that I discovered, to my great delight, the impending Dead show only four days hence at Memorial. Well! That will do just so! An opportunity to cleanse my soul among the good people of the music. The following three days were occupied with securing tickets and transport, and by-and-by I found myself cautiously making my way towards this ultimate and some say, last true expression of American freedom.\nWas this a dream? Was I just offered windowpane from that most decidedly clean-cut college boy on this painfully bright concrete clad sidewalk? looking as I do, seven years of hair and beard like some urban sasquatch, one that he might run from in abject terror in any other circumstance? Yet here he stood with his two kindly companions, sincerity emanating from their every pore, wishing to share the enormity of their beautiful discovery? To his credit, his was an honorable mission and he spoke no lie. Blessings to you kind brother, wherever you may be today. Glorious gifts await those that disregard stereotypes!\nAs the tabs dissolved on my tongue I thought, could this be real? after a year full of hellish dangers not unlike combat, as heavy seaborne equipment indiscriminately rendered the limbs from my shipmates, here am I? But yes! The sun shone its best that day as we all made our way to that intimate gathering of 90,000. Yes, dear reader, this was my first show inside the gates! While I had spent many other days/nights in lots asunder, begging for miracles, copping vegie burritos aplenty, this was MY inaugural self induced miracle. Though it took an unsettling force of will to disregard those impassioned pleas of \"miracle\" from the kind beloved brothers and sisters lining the approach to the gate. Steal your face.\n  By the time I arrived the place was to capacity and the boys were in full cry ala Minglewood. Rather than fulfilling my directive to take a particular seat, I spent the entirety of my visit traveling the venue from nosebleed to forest and back throughout the show.  Alas, long about Space I began feeling a mite itchy and made haste for the exit. This was no mistake as I emerged into the solemn surroundings to find the dejected survivors scattered about the eerily peaceful park-like environs enjoying the show as to best of their abilities by way of strained ear, unwittingly occupying far better seats yet less the precious line of sight. Lo, they took no solace in my assurances that their perches beneath blossoming trees was far superior to the teeming mess inside, no, missing the sight of their beloved Dead there on the stage, barely discernible across the distances was that greener grass found in the other guys bag. Pilgrims always. little did they know how good they did indeed had it in those days...\nWe were there. it was a time in Space... \n\nAway I strolled into the twilight of that odd Seattle eve. Ever memorable.  Off to my '66 splitty. Picking up some hitchers on the way south, on down to the Meadows... Back to life among the good, the live, the Dead... 22 years, 6 months, 15 days, 23 hours ago...\nI found myself on a building site three months later in Jackson Hole unable to explain my tears to my coworkers as the report came over the airwaves of Jerry's death. Its been a long strange trip to be sure. It's what makes us who we are today",
