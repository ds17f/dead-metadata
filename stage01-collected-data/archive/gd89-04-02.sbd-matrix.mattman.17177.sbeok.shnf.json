The GD at their rockin' best, not alot of space just straight forward R & R.\n\nThese where weird times in the middle of America.  I can't remember if this was the riot show or not, it was a long time ago, but I do remember that night the tension mounting with the staff inside.  I was standing near the sound board between sets when a security guy started fucking with people.  Eventually Healy lost it on him, pointing his flashlight at him saying, \"The next one out of here is going to be you if you don't cut the shit\"  I mean busting people for just listening to music, it ain't right.  Great show, get it, I give 4.5 stars but since someone gave the next night a 5 and this night was clearly superior I'll give it a 5.  Let it Shine!",

One of the best of this tour, if not the best.\n\nThe scene: We got into the parking lot and the vibe in the bus should have let us know what we were in store for.  Me and Larry had a blow-up about nothing.  The whole lot vibe was really tense.  I was in the hallway by the speakers during the first set and I saw someone popping a door open to allow some people in.  Bad news.  Next thing you know, it gets popped open once more and more than a dozen people push through before security shows up.  Next thing you know, the glass doors are being busted in and over a hunder assholes are streaming in - while I'm pinned against the wall in horror at what my brothers and sisters are doing.  And the worst part is that people inside were actually cheering for this.  Later I found out that Chard wound up in the hospital after a vial of liquid broke in his pocket.  His parents had to come down and he missed the rest of the tour.  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  What a great show musically, but what a disaster in every other respect.  \n\nThe music:  damn, this is a fine fine show musically.  Great song selection and fantastic, energetic playing.

      "review_text": "Vibal suborn <br />I did shows in April - but not these, and the word was that it was ninety degrees inside, over-packed, and with a sour mood in the air. There was gatecrashing, injuries, and that this was starting to occur alarmed pre-touch Heads and the band alike. Newcomers didn't seem to sense the difference (though they were not to blame for the narcs that showed up in the lots and the police presence on all roads going out). The thing is, dark clouds reached the band onstage. That said, from today's remove this show is probably the best of this tour. One reason GDP officially released this show was because no great copies were in circ, which is odd for '89. Didn't the Help>Slip>Franks soundcheck used to circ? Seems to be missing.\n\nFirst Set. The good <i>Iko</i> is an auspicious start. Right away it becomes a Brent show and stays so. Both \"All Over Nows\" are played - wonder how many of these shows there are. It's otherwise an average set until <i>We Can Run</i>. Whether or not this excites, it's  actually one of the best versions (and the 5th one). This sets up for a tight and brisk <i>Brown Eyed Women</i> that's one of the year's best (along with 10/26). <i>Queen Jane</i> is nicely uptempo and a solid <i>Music Never Stopped</i> leaves 'em happy.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Shakedown Street</i> pulls into a fine jam. This was a great era for <i>Dewiminna</i> and also for <i>Foolish Heart</i>, which Jer was really into at the time. <i>Drums>Space</i> are way above average. But after these it turns into drummer soup. This gets progressively worse by <i>Hey Jude</i>. Ouch. <i>Around & Around</i> bottoms out and then Jer pulls a rabbit out of a hat. In classic dead magic <i>Goin' Down the Road</i> is one of the best versions of the late '80s! <i>Lovelight</i> then thrives from the energy.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nBrown Eyed Women - tight and brisk\nGoin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad - a stellar version  \nLovelight - takes advantage of x-factor\n\nSOURCES: The first half of the 2nd set is usually up on YouTube, in iffy quality. Other than the official release, the matrix_mattman sounds best, though it has a couple edits in Drums, missing a  minute and a half, and one @3:15 in Space missing almost a minute. The pasternak_89780 is a great AUD. Most of the rest run too fast.",

      "review_text": "Great Show! Aiko starts us off bouncy and strong. Jerry sounds upbeat and talkative on guitar. Brent's organ sounds warm and punchy. Phil is rambling and rumbling all over this two-chord jam keeping it light and dance-y while holding down the low end. The drummers are aggressive but not fighting each other or the groove. Brent takes a turn soloing on his organ and we're in for a treat as he stabs the air with positively electric fills from his B-3. Jerry and Brent are off to a raucous start with their call and response vocals as the song closes. Not to be outdone, Bobby's Little Red Rooster is as smoldering hot as Jerry's Aiko was frenetic fun. Jerry takes on the sideman role here with his beautiful slide playing as Bobby tells the story of horny 'ole rooster.  Brent's church organ burbles in the background as Phil and the drummers lay back and serve the song. Brent takes the second solo, He starts slowly playing with simmering heat quickly building to a crescendo before handing off to Bobby's slide solo, which is less polished than Jerry but does a good job conveying the raw energy of the song's sexual overtones. Jerry finishes up with his own throbbing solo before dropping back into the verse of the song, the notes bouncing off the walls of this old hockey rink and delivering the perfect natural echo to round out this bluesy jam. Dire Wolf is punchy and well-played. Jerry's voice sounds a little gruffer than on Aiko but loosens a bit as he goes along. Bobby is singing along and everybody sounds like they are having a good time. Jerry breaks off a crisp solo nailing every note before diving into the next verse. They sound   solid and professional. And just like that it's over. Up next, It's All Over Now. Man, they are cruising! The tempo is up, They sound tight. Purposeful. Focused. Everyone is serving the song, listening to each other. No mistakes, no wasted notes. Brent takes a badass, wordless vocal adlib solo before tossing off a blinding keyboard solo on his Hammond. Jerry takes the handoff and solos a bit before handing off to Bobby who turns in a quieter than the rest of the band and kinda meh slide solo. Final verse and we're done. We're sweaty by now. I remember I was dancing in the penalty box, Phil side, and I had it all to myself, So plenty of space for dancing! Okay, We Can Run is pretty dated as I listen in 2021 and wasn't a super fun song (what with it's topic and all), but this is a pretty good version. The band seems to actually be playing with some passion so it comes off pretty well. Back to the fun, Brown Eyed Women keeps up the show's buoyant energy with a scholarly reading of this '70s classic . Jerry nails all the lyrics with only one tiny stumble, and Brent is supporting him all the way with sweet backup vocals to really outline the tunes many charms. Bobby delivers a lovely rendition of Dylan's Queen Jane Approximately. I feel like the boys almost always do a good job with this one, taking their time and building to a high tension release as Jerry's guitar spirals higher and higher with each verse. This one is no different. Jerry teases the TJed riff and the crowd signals its approval. Here we go! The drummers set the pace with a laid-back yet confident groove and Brent joins in with all the honky tonk-ish Southern boogie the song requires. Jerry is in fine voice for 1989.  You can hear the years of cigarettes in his voice but he still delivers great performances due to his ability to get inside songs and sing them with authenticity. The band is playing great. Very tight and composed. It's a loose song, but everything has to be just so, in a way, for it to work. It's working! The final two minutes are just a clinic in fine musicianship and the gestalt that happens when  players listen to each other and play WITH each other rather than just AT each other. MNS is a jam. They boldly plough through the verses at hi speed, racing to get to the jam quickly. Once they blast off for the jam Jerry is effusive and articulate. He has something to say. The notes cascade down in sheets. It's pretty and energetic and danceable. We all dance.  This is a great first set. Thanks guys. Shakedown opens the second set and gets off to a roaring start. Phil is significantly louder now. His bass is driving and swings with rhythmic propulsion. The drummers are steady and playing as one, making a bed for everyone else to lie in. During the verses the band is composed and plays with purpose. The jam is lively and nimble. This is a team sport. No one wants to drop the ball. They move forward together through sonic space as some sort of musical Rube Goldberg device, each player taking a turn in moving the energy forward. After roughly eleven minutes they settle down and land the song gently yet authoritatively.  Without hesitation Bobby jumps up and leads the guys through a festive Man Smart that continues the spirited mood of Shakedown. Not previously known for being tight or well-rehearsed, this is \"professional\" Grateful Dead. This incarnation of the band can turn in polished performances commensurate with their experience, and when they do it it's a sound to behold. Foolish Heart is strident and glides along innocently enough. It's dashing pace and spritely tune driving us to dance even if we're not sure how we feel about this \"new\" song. It's certainly well played. Brent gets off on it, tossing out a rollicking bit of playing near the song's end that seems purposeful and keeps the party going so we go with it. Drums and Space. Trips are for kids! Okay...My favorite song out of space is probably The Wheel. It's so perfect for bringing you out of the relative weirdness and confusion of Space. This one goes pretty directly into the song, but I really like it when Jerry spools it out in long glissandos of reeling, rhyming licks hinting around the theme but never quite playing it directly. That said, this version is solid. It's not overly precious or delicate and it delivers just enough thunder to set us up for an epic Dear Mr. Fantasy/ Hey Jude (Reprise) that  had me singing along at the top of my lungs. At this point they had us in the palm of their hands. Perched on the second level,  engulfed in a sea of humanity, I looked down and could feel the entire arenas' heart beat as one.  Around and Around is chipper and keeps us dancing some more. GDTRFB is fraking marvelous. Brent's organ chortles and chugs. By turns churchy and greasy, his organ grunts its way through this traditional lament. Jerry's runs are also solidly soulful and sunny on this mournful ballad about bad times. The Lovelight is absolutely bumping. Just wall-to-wall good vibes. Finally, it's Baby Blue as the Sunday night closer and it feels like an appropriate choice. Of course, nothing is what it seems so the drummers step on each other a bit: Jer flubs a line. But, overall, ya know, it's pretty good. We walk out into the cool Pittsburgh night knowing we all had a real good time.",
