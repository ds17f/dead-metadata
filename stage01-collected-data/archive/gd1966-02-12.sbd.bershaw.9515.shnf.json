This is hilarious too. I just wish bob would shuttup during pigs rap when the drum kicks in. Sounds like they recorded this thing live at some zoo or something and then went back and were making commentary on it. Crazy, I wish I was there, back when all this stuff was new and fresh. \"GET THAT GODDAMN MICROPHONE OUTTA MY FACE!\"",
