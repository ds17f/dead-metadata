      "review_text": "Lets put it in perspective The show itself was above average for the tour (but maybe being second row Jerry's side has skewed my perspective), albeit forever tainted whether it deserves to be or not.  There is still a crisp Dire Wolf (w/ Jer grinning ear to ear even if he meant the \"Don't Murder Me\" line), a monstrous Let it Grow, and a Fire that goes so far off the band forgets they only sang one verse before traveling into an ominous, befitting Victim. All Too Much (\"for me to take\") and New Speedway (de facto \"riot\" song) were also carefully selected by the band I'm sure. That aside...Sunshine, All Too Much, New Speedway, Attics, Sugar and Quinn are also welcome additions to any show.  \n\nRecording cuts pulls it from a 4 to a 3.  I can't go as low as a 1 though, but I can understand the critique of cutting a Scarlet/Fire mid-way. I'm choosing to rate it on the show itself though, regardless of the recording and the exterior incident. If you think it's too generous, don't worry, there's plenty of people on this board underating the show based solely on the gate-crashing (it's NOT a 0, 1 or 2-star show from a playing and setlist perspective--don't care what you say). What's also a bummer is we didn't get our Help/Slip/Frank the next night (standard Deer Creek number) and it would have been the last ever; never was played the rest of the tour to all our collective loss. \n\nIncidentally, the soundcheck for this show was perhaps the best treat of the day. I remember sitting with a bud by the creek itself and listening to clear versions of Death Don't, Hoochie Coochie Man (bob singing), a full Visions of Johanna, and a couple HC Sunshines...quite a moment I'll never forget.",

However, leave to the fans to create inspiration for the band to turn it on. Even if it was in negative form like the gate crashers. The Desolation Row is sung by Bobby with a roar that really carries through, hes paying special attention to the Lyric. The Drums is really great....The New Speedway Boogie nearly takes off like the protest song is was designed to be, but it does fall short. Jerry has a hard time closing the deal in this show. All in all, this is a good one for serious collectors, you can really feel the tension in the air and in the sound. I wasnt there, but I can tell by listenting that \"something\" was going on.",

As for the out of hand idiots who started tearing the fence down and all the other shit you stated...UP YOURS!

      "review_text": "Another Look at The Riot Show Go to bottom of post for links to video of the riot. For what it's worth here's my story of that day--I remember the crowd cheering as the gatecrashers came over the fence. The people around me were very excited and laughing. AND I QUOTE THE BANDS LETTER \"At Deer Creek, we watched many of you cheer on and help a thousand fools kick down the fence and break into the show. \" REMEMBER WHILE THE GATECRASHERS CAME OVER THE CROWD CHEERED! YOU CAN HEAR IT IN THE BOOTLEG Listen to Desolation Row at 1 min 30 sec's.. the CROWD GOES WILD. I remember before the show people saying there was going to be a riot because the cops were acting like OVER THE TOP DICKHEADS arresting kids all over the place and with a huge attitude about how they were going to teach these damn hippies some hoosier respect. When the riot actually happened and all that night, everyone we talked to thought it was great. Remember the band's letter \"we watched many of you cheer on and help a thousand fools kick down the fence and break into the show.\" We went to Pine Lakes and partied down after the show, walking through the smashed fence and down the hill past the upside down police cars. Nobody was mad at the gate crashers UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE BAND ANNOUNCED IT HAD CANCELLED THE SHOW. I didn't even realize it was a \"riot\" until the radio announcers said so when I woke up the morning of the 3rd. Then and only then did signs appear saying \"GATE CRASHERS SUCK\" but the attitude was still that it was the cops' fault. As a 300+ show head I had more fun at Pine Lakes the night of the cancelled show than the night before. A sad but true end to the greatest band ever. Miss you Jerry. -From someone who was there. For an incredible video of the gate crash as it happened go here: http://lftd.rox.com/GateCrash.html or email me at ascheylus@yahoo.com and I'll send you the video. If you want to see video about how the cops were acting that day click here: http://lftd.rox.com/confrontation.html and there is a group of cops treating a fan like a complete dickhead with the rioters in the background. You can hear on tape \"They just beat the shit out of that guy for no reason!\" Incredible stuff written for the alternative newspaper I worked for at the time. http://lftd.rox.com/ \"Life Following the Dead\" written for NUVO Newsweekly.",

I was in the lawn, and I remember when the rioters broke through the fence.\n\nI remember some punk-ass kid sliding down into the lawn right next to me with a big s**t-eating grin on his face, trying to blend in with me and my friends. And I remember standing up and shouting at the top of my lungs, \"If you don't have a ticket, you don't F*ing belong here. Go the F* home.\"\n\nAnd I wasn't the only one. There were plenty of people pissed off at the rioters, well before they cancelled the show. I camped out for tickets for both nights, with some of my best friends, and we dumped a ton of money on travel expenses to get the tickets. My girlfriend and I decided that we didn't want to see the second show if the crowd was going to ruin the show. So by the time the announcement came down the next day, we had already cancelled our show -- we traded our tickets (which were going for $100+ dollars, but we weren't interested in cash -- that's not what it was about), and drove home to consider going to St. Louis. We didn't find out until later that day when the roommates came in behind us that the second show had been cancelled.\n\nIn fact, we walked out of the first show. The last tune I heard as we were leaving was \"Victim or the Crime\" -- clearly a message to the crowd, which largely fell on deaf ears. We weren't the only ones walking out, although most people stayed to see the rest of the very short show. I remember people praying at the gates, clearly trying to help mend the damage done -- for what it was worth.\n\nThose of you who crashed the gates, I hope you've grown up since then. And I hope you've asked yourself just who the hell you thought you were rioting against -- because in the end, you hurt the band, you hurt yourselves, you hurt me, and you hurt the entire tour. And for what? To mess with the pigs? For the thrill of it? \n\nYou weren't the victims -- you were the crime. And it really is that simple.\n\nThat said, the tiny bit of the show that was free from this madness was good -- at least, that's the way I remember it. And I remember Victim being a very passionate rendition.\n\nYes, a very dark, strange, twisted and confusing night. I didn't even mention the insanity in the lot, the campgrounds, or the interstate surrounding the venue. All in all, my darkest show, and a very painful and sad memory.\n\nI'm downloading the show anyway -- you have to take the bad with the good.",

Bobby, thanks for delivering and sticking with it thru the rest of the 1st set chaos-the Let it Grow and Tenn Jed are probably the tightest versions of the whole year. Dire Wolf and HC Sunshine are top notch too. Yes, Bobby, that was me jumping up & down like a lunatic in the back of the pavilion screaming 'Let It Grow, Bobby' near the end of set I. Thanks for delivering yet again. Forutnately the yuppies whose seats I squatted in didn't come back until the end of the set, refreshments in hand and chatting on their cel phones about what they just saw. \n\n2nd set was very trippy. Scarlet>Fire>Victim is big time spooky. Bralove sampled the propellers of the Indiana State Police's helicopters during 'space' and sent them thru the entire PA. \n\nThere was one of those low wattage, high quality FM broadcasts of this show.

It hurt the band and fellow heads, that attitude was pretty much what was wrong with the scene from the late 80's on. \n\nMusically the show was decent for those that remember, a good Desolation, Dire Wolf had substance and the HCS was very welcome.",

Hey gatecrasher, next time I see you at a slayer show I'm going to crash your fucking skull with a 360 roundhouse. You fucking puke! As for the music, just a ho-hum 95 show. Although the new boogie speedway is powerful. Lets just hope these two buttholes aren't on the STS9 tour!",

As the years  progressed and as I immersed myself deeper and deeper into (the tail end) of this crazy train  called the Grateful Dead, I realized how wrong that was. I was at this show and spent an arm and a leg getting tix to do so. As the people poured over the fence during Desolation Row, I remember thinking what Foolish Hearts these kids have, and  hoped that one day they'd realize as I did that you can't just take what you don't deserve. This was the dark side of the scene that ruined the last years of what will be forever known as  cultural phenomenon.",

      "review_text": "Are we having fun yet? Who were these people cheering wildly for this band that was in free fall?  Anybody who'd seen them play at this venue in 1989 would have been sitting on the ground and crying.  Jerry is in that somnabulistic state that happens when you're fucked up on drugs and think no one notices (David Crosby did this in concert for years).  \"Maybe if I sing with emotion, no one will notice that I'm not able to play.\"  You know what?  I don't even think he was thinking that far ahead.  I think he was thinking . \"Get me out of this.  I need a break.\"\n\nClearly Garcia needed a respite from everything and clearly the GD machine wouldn't let him.  Bad GD machine!  Bad band! No doses for you! But his health was so bad at this point we probably would have lost him anyway.\n\nSomething happens when the gate crashers pour in and the band watches.  Desolation Row falls apart temporarily, then they recover.  Bobby changes his rythym style to something more choppy and percussion-like, as if he's the one trying to save it on stage (it's his song after all---me?  I would have stopped playing but, hey, the show must go on!).  The drummers take a powder and Phil is clearly too distressed to play.  The last straw, they all probably thought.  Or just another night on Hell Tour?\n\nBut then the gig gets interesting and a band literally dying before our eyes starts to comment through song, and Garcia, still imprisoned by his demons, responds as best he can.  Somehow they manage to play a show, even though they probably had the \"fuck this shit\" talk during the break.  Anticipating a riot if they did book,  they play as clear a fuck you to the gate crashers as possible.  \n\nIt's the reason I come back to this show.  It's the Hell Tour in a nutshell. It really has some weird dynamic that makes it as interesting as watching the aftermath of a train wreck.  But with better songs.  Don't get me wrong I actually like this show.\n\nThe New Speedway is the perfect choice and it's as good as any New Speedway I heard from '92.  I never liked the way they played it after its stunning breakout in '91 apart from the RFK version from this same tour, and maybe the Shoreline '95 version.  \n\nI'll never understand why, when it was so clear for years, that the band, because of Garcia, was in severe decline, that thousands still wanted to crash a Dead show.  There was a surfeit of idiots who wanted a party and to get in on the fun, I guess. Some party.  Some fun.  Excuse us, we're watching our band die here, if you don't mind.\n\nIf they had played stadiums around this holiday week-end this debacle probably wouldn't have happened. Highgate was a clusterfuck too with a bad bad show.   But this show is more interesting.  Like a late Charlie Parker date.  You can't help but be proud of them playing through the storm.  You kind of want to hug them.  There are some real surprises here and one of them is their perserverance.  They were the Dead.  What else did they know but that they must let the music play the band.\n\nI'll come back to this one.  It's historical and has its moments.\n\nThe sound is the usual mediocre sort of recording I regularly received from 93-95, but because it's outdoors, it ain't too bad.  Phil is clear.  And the other audience I heard back in '96 was worse.  I'd take this over the SBD just because this kind of demands that you hear the crowd to \"get it\".\n\nLastly, the Broken Arrow is a bit much, if you want my opinion, with Jerry's awful fooling around with that MIDI pedal steel (a terrible insult to Phil) and Phil's punk rock vocal.\n\nMaybe that caused the riot.\n\nKidding.\n\nDeer Creek was heaven any other year.  I miss it.  I miss them more.",

It was oppressive and confrontational. For example, we saw three buzzcut policemen in garish tie-dyes chasing a hippie around the lake in the late afternoon at the base of the hill at the spot where the later storming of the wall would take place. This was like no other concert at Deer Creek (I missed only one of them.) The weird vibe introduced by the police was the catalyst for all the negative energy that was to transpire later that evening. I was sitting on the grass stage left and hardly noticed the wall crashing. The concert was good, and i was looking forward to the next night, and to many years down the road. Grateful to have the music. Many thanks.",

      "review_text": "From the Inside Out I must speak my peace here.  I was inside at the top.  I heard the commotion outside and looked through the fence and saw people as much as three deep at a marked off line where about six cops stood in a line.  One was walking back and forth with a dog.  I saw one deadhead who WAS on tour running the length of the crowd urging them on.  It was at that point they made the run.  I in no way applauded this group as I started screaming GO DOWN GO DOWN they are going to push the fence down on us.  The first person over I saw hopped the chain link on the side.  Then the boards started coming off the fence.  I turned and could not watch anymore.  As we stood in shocked amazement, I knew it was bad.  When they were all in, I headed back up to the fence.  As soon as I was at the top the first thing, I saw was two what appeared to me to be locals (I was on the whole tour and never saw these people.)  As the ushers and cops were trying to put some of the boards in place as they said, \"go ahead and put them back we will just tear it down again.  I went straight to them and asked WHAT are you doing??????  The show is on the stage!!!!!!!!! Three others joined me we surround these two people and said who are you???? How dare you!!!! You do not have a clue what you have done. \nIt progressed even into the next day as we went to mcd's for breakfast and a kid beside me turned and said, \"Can you believe this?  They are wearing tie-dyes trying to impress.  \"I threw down and told him Deer Creek and Noblesville have always welcomed us.  Signs saying welcome deadheads on many businesses.  Now it will never be again.\nI nver applauded. miracles were there. I handed out 1 in an incredible wayat this very show. \nMy husband and I went in and they took only one of our tickets. As SOON as we got through the gate we looked down and of all things there was ANOTGER TICKET!!!!!! My husband went out and miracled one ticket and used his to get back in. (you can call this a rip off but I truly see this as a MIRACLE.) The point????? Many ways to get into a show without destruction.",

During the first set (Desolation Row) I saw a swarm of lanky hippies charge the hillside. I realized that all hell was going to break loose. I looked at Alex and said, \"Let's roll!\" I foolishly tossed a small cooler of beer over my head and started running. Then I thought to myself, why the fuck did I do that? I fought my way back through the sea of stank bodies and retrieved the mini-cooler. After we made our way in through the jagged torn up fence, I opened a luke-cold Keystone and took a big gulp. Very satisfying. There was a lot of negativity expressed toward the gate crashers. To all of you, I still say - go fuck yourselves.",

I was 21 at the time & felt 60 because of what the youth did that night. I was embarrassed to even be outside on the grounds at all after the nioght was over. It was only my 3rd show (gimme a break, I lived in oppressive Arkansas until around that time). I was there outside too but with tix for the next night & for the rest of the tour. Me & a friend were tripping our brains out by the water listening while another friend was inside taping. But when I saw the mob headed up the hill toward the gates/fence we stood up in awe, wondering what violence the cops did to trigger this since these jackbooted idiots were EVERYWHERE that night. We were horrified & of course this all spun us into a funky trip from hell. We did end up force-laughing it off to just get through the night not realizing what the fools had actually done until after the show & our friend told us the \"inside\" story. Man the Boys were so pissed that when they left the venue the tour bus was in a constant semi-truck horn mode. VERY loud & obvious they were pissed. i felt bad since my body contributed to the number of people outside even though we did nothing \"wrong\". Sooo, when they canceled the next day we sold our St. Louis tix thinking it'd be more of the same perhaps (2 people died I think from a porch collapse after a show there) & hung out in Chicago & ended up catching the last 2 shows ever. It was surreal to say the least and the therapy worked but VERY differently than I thought it would... ain't that just like the Dead? There's always more than \"a concert\"!!",
