Phil's bass was popping and crackling. The opener \"One More Saturday Night\" caused my dancing bones to curl within my skin. I finally realized a person can dance two different dances at the same time.\n13th and 14th of July, 1985 will always be etched in the genetic make-up of my still twisting DNA. Too bad this cannot be successfully downloade in digital form. I do have an excellent soundboard tape, though.\n\n  PS:(addendum 7/09/08) I can now stream-load..so that helps. \"Fire on the Mountain\" literally smokes here. One of the few 80's shows where it is not caboosed to \"Scarlet Begonias\". This version of FOTM is so hot because the hills behind the stage that day, were on fire while the Dead played \"Fire on the Mountain\".\nshockman",

The song is one of the weakest in the Dead canon and nearly every time it's a knuckle-dragging exercise in extreme tedium.\n\nThis version is interesting and it's because of the 7th member of the Dead, the unsung hero of the best post-1974 year the Dead existed (1985): Dan Healy.\n\nI bow down.\n\nAdding:  if you don't think that Healy was a key irreplaceable contributor to the sound of the band in '85 (indeed, all through the early 80s), you are mistaken.  As to whether the band was \"inspired\" in 1985, I'd say simply that they were taking the drugs they needed to take.  Of course, the band -- including Healy -- paid an infamous price for all that fun.  After 1985, the Dead's ability to perform began to decline in a very serious way.  They would never again mount a tour remotely approaching the creativity and intensity of that summer's.\n\nAddendum 8 years later (June 24, 2015):  the Bird Song here is pretty special, too.",

Thanks Archive I can't say I totally agree that either \"Fire on the Mountain\" is one of the weaker songs, or that Dan Healy was the reason they sounded so good in 1985.  \n\nThe lyrics alone make Fire a terrific song.  The beat is ancient sounding.  \n\nDan Healy was good sometimes, but the Dead were a little cleaner in 1985 and inspired by their 20th anniversary.  For whatever reason, they rocked that year more than any other in the 80's (although 80 and 89 were arguably as good).  If Healy was that good, he wouldn't have been fired in 90 for secretly messing with their sound.  \n\nThis show has excellent sound, and a neat setlist.  It's a nice show from one of the best summer tours ever.  Sit back and enjoy.",

Being only 15 at the time an older head nodded 'no way'.  Sure enough Jerry looked over his glasses and confirmed with some very Dupress filled notes.  Everything was to good to be true that day.  We were about 15 feet from the stage so I know jerry heard my Dupress call loud and clear.\n\nI remember leaning against the railing stage about 15 minutes before the show, and seeing Jerry walking gingerly in his red shirt, taking some mean drags of a smoke as he headed toward stage side.  It was so casual, no one hollard or none of that , man dead heads are where it's at.\n\nThe Fire on the hill that inspired the Saturday into Fire On The Mountain opener is just one of those unspoken things, where you know your witnessing something very unique and you can just sit back and smile smile smile...\n\nI think they even invented ways to cool our asses down during the break that year, if it wasn't with a \"Whole Pale of Water\" it was with some hoses sprinkling down from above, sure felt good on this smokey, ash dry heat, fire burnin day. \n\nSo Surreal",

If Healy was that good, he wouldn't have been fired in 90 for secretly messing with their sound. </i>\n\nTo be blunt, you have no clue what you are talking about. Healy was let go in 94, pre-tour, for what have been called \"personal reasons\". It had <i>nothing </i>to do with his abilities sound-wise.\n\nI have aud tapes that I made from the Omni '91 run that are as powerful as anything anyone has <i>ever </i>done in an arena. You can hear the band and Healy using the PA's enormous, clean volume to make the Omni just <b>ring </b>on things like the double stops on <i>Greatest Story</i>. BAM...BAM.BAM...on a good system it just amazes. Healy, along with a few others, including Owsley, <i>reinvented </i>how sound systems work. They and he deserve all the credit in the world, as without their contributions, the modern day rock concert in it's current form would not exist. Sound systems went from two little columns and an amp for announcing songs for the big band to 300 people, to the high-end, <b>precision </b>music reproduction and amplification systems we have today that allow 50,000 people to hear a pin drop from half a mile away. Healy was instrumental in making that happen, and also making the magic that was the Grateful Dead happen on a nightly basis.",

It isn't that hard of a tune (I've played jazz guitar 25+ years) and Jerry just botched some of them musically and lyrically. Of course I loved seeing it, but listening back it was clear how far they had sunk since '70-->'74. That was the sad part.",

Every song is tight and well played with some great energy. Even Fire, which I find hit-or-miss and sometimes boring, is one of the finer versions I know of\n\nOverall the Dead's second sets in the 80s and 90s (with some exceptions) don't impress me and this is one of those. Although tight, there is minimal jamming which is why in my opinion their first sets are better in the later years. If I want to hear a Cryptical, Other One, or Comes a Time, I'll go for a 70's show where the playing is better and the jams are more exploratory.\n\nGood how though, especially if you like 80s Dead.",

A friend went to UCSB, so Ventura sounded like a fine idea.  Holy shit, these two shows were hot!  This first day was most memorable and intense.  First, the set list, playing and overall vibe was incredible.  Second, after somehow making it back to Santa Barbara, all sorts of shenanigans occurred.  Bike ride all over Isle Visa in the dark that included a stop at the stadium, where we scaled the fence and watched our buddy's friend tightrope walk on the edge of the stadium with the parking lot probably 200 feet down.  We were like holy shit dude what are you fucking doing! (Fortunately he didn't fall!)   Later we were stopped by the police out on the bike trails who were convinced our bikes were stolen (they weren't).  I had tossed a bag of weed into the dark when we saw them up ahead and tragically couldn't find it when we looped back.  Finally we were safe back to where we were staying on Del Playa and fell asleep on a beck deck in our sleeping bags listening to the Pacific Ocean roar.  Then back to the fairgrounds for the Sunday show...",
