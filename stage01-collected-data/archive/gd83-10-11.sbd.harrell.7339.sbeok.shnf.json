He builds some tension by throttling a couple of key notes, then swoops down on the chord changes, followed by a beautiful bend.  The song being in its early stages of development, he only runs through it once.  His fills, though, are also sublime.  \n\nAlthough many feel that this tune was a throwaway, a closer listen reveals a chord structure that offers Garcia a great opportunity to do what he does like no other:  improvise melodically.",

Starting with Miracle everything is sheer brilliance. Bertha is upbeat and similar to most early 80s renditions of this song. Jam out of Bertha into China Doll is mesmerizing, as is China Doll. Jerry is in top vocal form and remembering the lyrics!                                            \n\nSaint Steven isn't as good as early 70s renditions but i think it beats the hell out of any Donnafied version of the song. Its great to observe that even after a period of mass transition from 70s to 80s, the boys felt it nessesary to bring back this gem for 3 shows. This was the first. Thank god. Those who saw it are truley grateful.\n\nSaint>Throwing Stones has a beautiful transition and keeps it melodic friendliness with plenty of audible Brent riffs and Phil bombs. Touch set closer is appropriate considering the last two songs and closes it nicley.\n\nNot an ordinary show and certainly not uninspired. This was a period of musical experimentation for the boys and this show is proof that they break the show set structure from their ordinary process to something different, and special.",

Sadly, no \"encore\" instrumental here after the lyric reprise, like they did in the old days ...\n\nThe St. Stephen here is perfectly fine, far better than the plodding seventies versions, but far worse than anything from 68 (what isn't?).\n\nThe early arrangements of Throwing Stones are disturbing.  Sort of a Saint of Circumstance redux, which is sort of a Cassidy redux.  Bobby is on fire but the mix isn't kind to Jerry who starts off hot but ends up gasping for air in this mix.",

Jerry's dealer ALWAYS knows, lol....\n\nI heard on the train down from CT that they soundchecked St Stephen in Greensboro I think, or Richmond (the previous show) but hadn't played it & \"were going to play it tonight\". \"Yeah, Ok\" I said & didn't give it another thought until that space where the St Stephen teases just go on & on - insufferably on. at the time while waiting for them to finally break it out.\nFirst set is no big deal. Second set was another matter. Hot China > Rider; Solid rockin' Miracle > Bertha after a 3 year period of rarely being played on the East Coast. The Jam out of Bertha has a great 'Tubular Bells' (theme from the Exorcist) sound to it & just when you think they might've done the drums, China Doll comes along after a 2 year absense on the East Coast. A very melodic version, more upbeat & less dramatic than the 1980-81 post-drums version, but wwith a huge extended hynotic jam out into the drums - just fantastic.\n\nSt Strephen bad? I guess you weren't there and probably never saw it live......\n\nOh, yeah to finish the St Stephen story.....\n\nI heard years later that they indeed had soundchecked St Stephen in Hampton the previous show & that the reason they did not play it was that Jerry got sickj in the Second Set. I would tend to believe this as they only did two songs that night post-drums & both Bob selections (NFA > Sugar Mag), which was very odd for post 1980.\n\nFinally, I don't know how the rumor ever got started, but I was at both this show & Hartford 10/15/83 where they do the other St Stephen & thisa show & St Stephen blow that night away.",

Richmond was on a Saturday and I was still recuperating from it all the way up this show which was on the Monday that followed.It's amazing how the excessive consumption of acid,shrooms,blow,beer and weed could fuck you up if you mix them all continiously for a whole weekend nonstop.How we survived through it all and drove 8 hours up I95 to NY still amazes me. This was my tenth show.Great version of Bird Song. I love the way Jerry and Bobby play on it while Phil keeps himself in a nice mellow groove throught the song. Brent's tickeling his keys at just right moments too. Awesome China-Rider had the whole place jumping up and down. Nice jam into China Doll going into Drumz but when they busted out the Saint after Drumz the whole place was ecstatic,standing up quickly,(most of the place was sitting down during drumz) fists pumping in the air. Everybody was screaming \"Yes I Can!!!\" when the boys asked \"Can You Answer?\" That moment still stands out in my mind as one of the greatest things I ever witnessed at a MSG Dead show.The atmosphere was electricfying. I got a nice picture of Phil singing into Bobby's microphone during St. Stephen and I think it's that moment mentioned above. I too must add my 2 cents here regarding Day Job. I never liked the song back in the day. More so because of my rebellious mindset during the 80's and what the words dayjob meant to me back then. Joan Biaz said it right about us being the children of the 80's. Anyways. It's only now in my later years that I can appreciate it for what it is, another tune that Jerry showed his talents on. If we only knew the ride was going to end in less than a dozen years. 3 for the recording (Bobby is almost drowned in the mix) and a 4 for the performance.I'd like to give it 3.5 but 4 stars it is.Enough said.",

      "review_text": "NYC cop-st stephen The following night on the way in to 'the Gaeden' a NYC cop gave me the thumbs up screaming ST Stephen!!! This was NOT the Disneyland, tourist mecca of NEW York today. Early 80's NEW York was a different place with Johny Carson etc making nightly jokes about getting 'mugged'  in NY. Getting 'mugged' in Central Park was a cliche in 70's-80's NY. Cops were TOUGH so it was a shocker to see a COP grinning, screaming SAINT STEPHEN!!!! Memorable to say the least",

      "review_text": "Five stars?  Seriously? Ok folks, time to do some serious archive study.  I was at this show, it was great and all, I saw St. Stephen 1/10/79 and was ecstatic to hear it again this night (and at Hartford).  But come on folks.  You can listen to the Bertha without cringing?  China Doll?  Awesome song, but not this night.  Almost impossible to listen to Jerry singing it.  The Saint is sloppy, off key, and ragged.  They were trying, but get a grip.  I gave it 3 stars so I don't get yelled out.  But go back and listen to some REALLY 5 star stuff, 1/2/70, 11/2/69, then lets talk.",

      "review_text": "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly There's a lot of good in this show, some of it awesome.  There's a little bit of bad and one big piece of ugly.\n\nFirst the good - most of the show is a fine example of the Grateful Dead at this time.  Jack Straw is a strong performance.  Birdsong is always a highlight and this one does not disappoint.  I love the swirling sound of Jerry's guitar dancing with Brent's wonderful electronic piano sound, all buttressed by Phil's nimble bass stylings and the dynamic rhythm duo.  Yes, I love Brent's keyboard, no matter how some might call it \"tinny,\" or \"cheesy.\"  \n\nChina>Rider -- how can you not love the interplay here, even though Bob is way too low in the mix.  \n\nChina Doll -- beautiful song, not the best performance, but the jams into and out of it, especially the intro, are perfect examples of the out-of-nowhere jams they could come up with to the delight of the audience.\n\nSt. Stephen -- come on, this is not a bad performance at all.  Sure it's no 1-22-78, but what is?  There are a few off notes, but the energy level is through the roof.  \n\nAs is the case on the Throwin' Stones that follows.  That was before they started on what would become the standard jam that sounds like a slowed-down Sugar Magnolia intro.  This jam sounds more like Cassidy with it's use of the Lydian mode in a frenetic explosion of sound.  \n\nThe bad?  Day Job is just a bad song, period.  I Need a Miracle is not one of my favorites, either.\n\nThe ugly?  The horrible mess that is Wang Dang Doodle.  Earth to Jerry, the key is E, not B!  He plays in the wrong key the whole song.",

      "review_text": "St. Stephen t-shirt for sale This was one of the top 5 hottest Dead shows I ever saw (out of about 70 between 82 and 92). Yes, there are some ragged moments vocally (words and otherwise), but the energy is/was off da hook and for me that is far more important. WangDang was a breakout or close to it (at least rare at the time), and therefore notable. Jack Straw and Birdsong were also first set highlights, but there were no weak links. As is most often the case, they really stepped up their game in the second set. The entire pre-drums run was just rockin, especially Bertha. And if I recall correctly, China Doll was not in rotation much or at all at that time, and I think it was a big deal because Phil sang on that one (had his own mike), and that was a first in several years. I dont think much more needs to be said about the St Stephen rendition, except that the ragged moments were nothing in comparison to the energy coming from the stage.  And the energy coming back at the stage when the crowd recognized and appreciated the song, was never topped at any other show I attended (matrix or aud a must for this show). In my opinion, the Stones that followed might be the best rendition they ever played (before it got all locked down in the jam section). The rest of the set finished just as high energy and it was a night I will never forget. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that as luck would have it, I had a large bag full of original St Stephen t-shirts I made the night before with some friends tucked under my seat that were to go on sale after the show. Holy crap what a cosmic coincidence!!! They had a border of roses with a SYF scull in the middle. But instead of the lighting in the center of the skull there was a three color rainbow in the yin-yang shape (blue and red on either side of the rainbow with the two dots). the rainbow came spilling out of the scull jaws and spread into a pool below. It said on top: \"One man gathers\" and on the bottom: \"What another man spills.\" needless to say they were an almost instant sell out. but the next night, I couldn't get a ticket, and outside the show, some asshole cop ripped open my bag of shirts and threw them into the crowd/street. and of course it being NYC, everyone grabbed them and ran. People asked me how I knew the Dead were gonna break out St Stephen and my reply was: \"how did the Dead know I made the shirts the night before?\"",
