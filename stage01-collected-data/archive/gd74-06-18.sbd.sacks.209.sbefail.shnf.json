A rare Let it Grow jam into the Other One sequence that's just mind-bending, face-stealing and beautiful. And the only \"sin\" is that It's a Sin is so short!! Jerry lands us in a soulful Stella Blue. And then pulls out Morning Dew for an encore! This show is just one highlight after another. They may have reached their peak of the year tonight. I am of the opinion that the burden of playing big arenas and toting around the Wall of Sound in two semi trucks, began to wear on the boys by late summer.Some of the summer shows are weak in places. And the October Winterland shows are good but overrated IMHO compared to the spring/summer shows. This should be the first 1974 show you get. And- the Other One is so hot, maybe it did thunderstorm inside the Hall!!!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

There's that nice vocal inflection from Garcia:  \"i THOUGHT-I, her-erd....\"  Throughout, the song seems largely propelled by just a note or two from bass, piano and drums, creating a canyon-like spaciousness.  The quiet period after the \"doesn't matter verses\" is very extended, and is played with great tenderness.  Garcia goes into his buzzsaw at 12:05, and the crescendo builds band-round for probably forty solid seconds.  They just don't build 'em like this anymore....",

Having said that, this Freedom Hall show is among my personal top 5. \n\nThe show meets all my cream-of-the-crop criteria. First of all, I want to hear a surprise. In the case of the Freedom Hall show, we get \"Eyes of the World\" and \"China Doll\" in the first set. That counts as a surprise, right? Secondly, I want even the \"second tier\" songs to turn me on. With this show, songs like \"Mexicali Blues\" and \"Tennessee Jed\" capture my imagination more than usual. Thirdly, I want a fluid nasty jam in the second set, and with the WRS>Other One segment of this show the boys steal my face, for sure (not to mention coming back from outer space and gracefully sliding into \"Stella Blue\"). Fourthly (and lastly), I want the show to end with a non-standard encore. Don't give me no \"One More Saturday Night\" (yawn), \"Casey Jones\" or \"Johnny B. Goode\". Blow my mind! Shoot my wad! Cap it all with a cherry, Jerry! With this Freedom hall show you get \"Morning Dew\" as an encore. Simply wicked! \n\nBeyond meeting these criteria of mine, this recording sounds fabulous, the band is obviously feeling their oats, and there are lots of absolutely top notch little nuggets througout (like Jerry's pinched solo toward the end of \"Loser\"). \n\n1974 yielded several bonafide classics - such as Winterland 2/24 and Roosevelt Stadium 8/6 - and this little Kentucky jamboree certainly deserves to be counted in their company.\n\nI'm taking this show with me.",

This CD of songs is 5 star material. Around & Around, Tennessee Jed, and Morning Dew are about as good as they get. Around & Around is pure Rock N' Roll and Weir is Rock Star singer and Jerry is \nRock Star guitarist. The band gives 110%. Where do you see Tennessee Jed as the second to the last song of the second set? And it is played as such. It is not just Jerry, Weir is right there in dual lead which I love. Sugar Magnolia is \nnot played perfectly but is played with gusto. Go Donna go. I am a Donna supporter, not basher. She added a lot in concert. Just listen to this Sugar \nMagnolia and tell me who the man (woman). I loved it when she was up there wailing away. Morning Dew is Morning Dew. One of the best songs ever played. What I would give to hear the GD play Morning Dew again. It's A Sin is pure blues, I \nnever heard it before but it shows the GD could play anything, even beer songs and songs about some lady named Peggy. Eyes is great, flowing like bullets from a Tommy Gun.\n\nThe mix is great except Bob is a little lite like Miller. Other than that Jerry and Phil are clearly heard, Keith is there, vocals are loud, recording is louder than usual. In 1982 Mr. Garcia was twangy, 1991 acoustic electric, and \nin 1974 he spewed bullets. Elvis out.",

Turn it up and listen to Bobby talk after promised land about a spy that was supposed to reveal his or her self that night. I was very tempted to just leave promised land off and start disc 1 with roses, but decided to leave it on there. The second set is crazy, and the first set is nothing to sneeze at either.",

Midway, Jerry and Keith do a beautiful duet that starts \"sotto voce\" and slowly builds to a climax. I'm not saying this is the best song of the show--it's a fabulous show.

It's a Sin into Stella Blue is smooth as silk.  Stella Blue has some magic moments when Jerry and Phil are conjoined twins connected at the brain.  This is a great showcase concert for Phil.  He is assertive throughout (esp. shines on Eyes), with Phil bombs aplenty.  Even with some early technical difficulties, the show recovers and soars to dizzying heights.

I guess at things I didn't see mentioned in the other reviews. The Jam at the end of Around and Around is absolutely ferocious (check out Phil going nuts at the very end). Jerry's Slide work in Weather Report I is amazing. Weir in top form as well and his singing is beautiful. How about the woman's scream right before Phil drops the atom bomb opening to The Other One? The Eyes is so beautifully paced. The quintissential Row Jimmy. and its not even fair to try to put in words how good the transition is between The Other One and the heartbreaking Stella Blue (my personal favorite version). Its not just the It's a Sin jam that makes that piece. They create a feedback improvisation that isn't just sound... its a living breathing monster, also note how Billy sets up the jazz beat that all others tune into which in turns into that amazing piece of blues that is in the pantheon of recorded blues music IMO. This was The Dead at the peak of their powers. Masterful.",

      "review_text": "In The Latter Days Of A Decade In the latter days of a decade known as the \"Decade of the Dead\" and just days prior to the addition of \"Set 1.5, Phil & Ned,\" The boys waltzed into Louisville (pronounced \"Lou-a-vull\") with their Wall of Sound in tow and busted out a phat kernel (intended pun on spelling) of a show.\n\nNever mind Promised and Roses ~ they're both messed up, but the recording starts to come into view on Black Throated with a very reedy Weir vocal that cuts in and out a bit before settling down.\n\nI was fortunate enough to see the GD 12 times in 1974, including all five of the final shows at Winterland, and the GD didn't do anything but play one fine show after another with all of them slightly tarnished around the edges by Wall of Sound tech difficulties, but no matter, the Kwipment Krew always saw them through the night by replacing circuit breakers on amps and speaker arrays and we were always more than well-pleased with the results. I will not go on and on about it, but this era, which featured the WOS, was an era of wonderful sounding shows, even if they were less than perfect in various places. All I can say is you had to have been there to appreciate what that humongous monstrosity could spew and spray in gorgeous color-layered display.\n\nNonetheless, tech problems and all, by the time this show rolls into Ramble the GD are really cooking, and even though there is a tin taste to the higher freakwentseas, Jerry's Wolf is omnipresent ~ growling at and freezing its intended prey. I melt everytime I hear one of his glorious chords. Beat It starts after 2 beats and it's fine and fair. Loser is pedestrian, but Eyes floats in and out of consciousness like my reality-addled psyche. The masterpiece just keeps me bobbing up and down as a buoy in rough seas and fog, a special relief to one so lost, there it is pointing the way to immortality... Just as every version of this song in this great year, but this one is a precious version ~ one you keep close to your bosom everytime you feel like flipping out. You take a deep breath and you are centered by it and then it goes into a thought-jangling jam of unexpressable joy. No acid here, kids. Who needs it? And then?...China Doll. Oooh, get jiggy wit' it. 'Dis be da suicide song, but no one feels like doing demselves in. Jerry all sweet and low. Ah, introspection, what novels we write!\n\nA fiery Around closes set 1. Jerry is trying to take off but his wings are tied up a bit, yet Bobby picks it up and screams heartily til the end.\n\nLoose Lucy is a pleasant thing to open set 2 and, though you can hear all instruments coming through with remarkable clarity, this version sounds not well developed. An unsure Jerry flubs lyrics. El Paso is the usual stuff with lots of Garcia signatures all abounding. Jimmy Row starts off with some interesting harmonium meanderings off Keith's Rhodes. It is a provocative blend nestled amongst Jerry and Bob's chicken plucks. The slide solo is pristine in its attack leaving you with the sensation of having just been attenuated and it leads back into a sharply sung vocal part and presents itself as a perfect platform for the delicious Weather Report Suite that follows upon Jimmy's heels. At this point in the show the Dead are firing on all 12 cylinders. The slide part on WRS pulls the strain right out of your heart and heals all the striated muscles and massages the nerve endings and thereby the blood starts to really pump and flow. Ah, sweet nourishment.\n\nLet It Grow is pretty good, but the boys seem to lose it momentarily here and there and then to make up for past transgressions they catch fire and cannot extinguish themselves. You can hear some of Phil's speakers blowing. There is a raspy sound to them when he hits the really low notes ~ kind of a tweeting sound. These are only momentary, so, no adjustment is needed to your EQ, but the bass is definitely clipping ever so slightly. What ensues is a monumental jam and the unfolding of Jerry's previously wounded wings. Then, just as the jam gets frollicking they move into this protracted venture of sonic surgery, moving up and down and in and out and capping off one synapse before moving onto the next. All sorts  of introspective weirdness entails. It's a drunk trying to walk a straight line, or find his keys, or get his fly unstuck. What ensues is Jerry dying in the light and being reborn, dying in the light and being reborn into glory, dying into glory until the first touches of the Other One.\n\nIn the Other One all of Jerry's pent up rage and frustration come to the forefront. He goes for the burn. He is the veritable personification of \"locked and loaded.\" It's a conversation, nee'... argument, betwixt a player and his guitar. As he  wrestles with the angel, the bands stays right there by his side, coaxing, replying, taunting, challenging, encouraging, edifying. Jerry goes into his leopard tone, minds meld, knees part. The animal is unleashed. There is no longer thought, or intention, or trying. There is a man who has so totally dismantled and rebuilt himself all in the course of two plus hours, that out of sheer presence we are dragged along with him, to boot! And then, at once, back on our feet and dusting ourselves off. Phew, what was that? A truck full of WOS Kwipment that just ran me over?\n\nZooooot... into It's A Sin jam. Back to planet earth. That was not rehearsed, kiddies. That song was not on the setlist for that night I guarantee. It's a Sin is fallen into like a missed step on a dark night that you almost don't see until the last second and then without stumbling into Stella.\n\nThe GD throw Big River in as a breather and Jerry does the final touches on exorcising all the demons that befuddled him earlier. The evidence of River and Tennessee posed in the second set is a reminder to us that that the Grateful Dead had still not given themselves over to a predetermined setlist. In later years a River or a Tennessee would never arise in any second set. Both are epic versions.\n\nBefore Sugar Mag Bobby asks a patron that they pass a bottle forward rather than throw it. Phil quips, \"Yeah, we could use the 3 cents.\"\n\nMorning Dew. Was it the deposit on a 12-ounce glass bottle? What was the problem I had before I started this stream? I don't know. I forgot. \n\nI guess it doesn't matter.",

There are longer Eyes's, but none more dramatic or compelling in execution.\n\nEdited:  Gonna add to this a bit.  The nifty jam from Let It Grow into the Other One is not one I remember hearing in any other show.  They almost seem to be going into the China >Rider jam from this time period at one point, but then they modulate into the key of E for the Other One.  At about 5:45 into the The Other One, the beat drops out, and they start the space jam with Jerry, quietly at first, then louder, starting some meltdown riffage, but someone else (Weir? Lesh?) is producing some freaky noises that I haven't heard in any other show, but that fit in perfectly here.  It drives me wild every time I hear it.  After several minutes of space, they slip easily into a funk jam which in turn gives way to the It's a Sin theme and then to a gorgeous Stella.\n\nI also previously forgot to mention the excellent Morning Dew which closes out this fine show.  It's worth checking out on its own.  This is one of those shows I keep going back to over and over for its power and brilliance, not to mention the excellent sound quality (other than a little pitch weirdness at the beginning of WRS).",

And even in June, a quite interesting month of experimentation for the boys, this show stands out. Excellent sound quality with a proper mix. Everyone is playing their heart out. Keith is especially on tonight and is obviously not too wasted. Garcia and the boys give off their usual 74' musicianship amazingness.\n \nMost of the cuts in the first set are the best versions of any time they'd ever play it. The El Paso especially, usually set aside as a fun, but first set Bobby Song, bleeds with heavy power strumming and  exceptional playing from Keith Godchaux. Then comes second set, what makes this show legendary. WRS>Let it Grow>Other One>It's A Sin>Stella Blue stands out as some of the Dead's most varied playing with moments of blissful stillness and throbbing intensity. Once the loose jam in Other One turns into its ultimate mature Jam, it becomes fairly obvious that the last 35 minutes of listening has been mostly amazingly tight improvisations and communication. Not underplaying the amazing Jam out of Let it Grow of course.  I am listening to the Eyes right now and it has a quality Lesh jam after verse three, like all pre-hiatus Eyes should have.

And why don't they put these albums on iTunes, huh?\n\n1 rating because of these shows always selling out and making owners into elitists. \n\nHey, I'll give you my Complete Fillmore West 1969 set for fucking free! How do you like that Christ-like behavior?",

True that, but I`m here to tell ya, I`m a fan the cowboy songs and Big River is the measuring stick in 73 and 74. Take a listen to this tight light little gold nugget: Each band member moving together in unison with Billy just driving this mule train. Don`t take any wooden nickels.\"The trouble with you is the trouble with me,\nyou got two good EYES but you still don`t see\".",

A note able show for it's looseness and how it boarder lines insanity and genius. It all starts with Eyes OTW and throughout the rest of the show Jerry and the band takes the music to emotional heights and peaks and valleys.",
