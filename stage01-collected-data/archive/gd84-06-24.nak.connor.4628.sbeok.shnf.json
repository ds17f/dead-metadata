Decent 1st set, but as usual the real excitement is the 2nd with practically definitive versions of everything.  Jerry's voice in this period was so expressive, even as his decline must have been so alarming.  He could still play his ass off, and for the most part he wasn't in the half-dead comatose state that he would be in 10 years later, forgetting every other word.  However, he almost forgets the \"ran into a rainstorm\" line from Bertha, surprising considering that it was apparently raining buckets at this show.  I actually know somebody who was at this show, he's not even a Head he just went with a friend.  Lucky.  Highlights: Perfect rendition of China Doll, smokin' Miracle where the band kicks in right at the tempo the audience is clapping out, nice spacy Playin', epic Sugar Mag.  If I lived back East I would definitely go see The Dead there this summer, just to get a feel for what it must have been like in the glory days.",

The \"Dancing\" was an awesome surprise but from there it is difficult to really get real excited about the music.  The band played, the mud grew deeper, and sometimes it seemed like Jerry may have been sinking with us.  The \"Satisfaction\" is fun and if you listen real close to the end, Jerry plays the first few notes of \"This Will be the Last Time\" befoe Bobby cuts him off which may have referred to those of us left alive on the lawn or song itself.  I guess we will never know.  Play this one in the shower for best efect.  \n\nGreat audience recording but isn't there a soundboard in circulation?",

The whole 2nd set> which contains the most thrilling versions of these songs I ever saw in person.( and I saw alot of versions..yuk...yuk..) I remember Bobby sprinting across the entire stage width during the bombs in Bertha, and Billy standing on two feet bashing his drums kit into submission during Playin/Samson> Drums. China Doll and Wharf Rat have be heard to believed. 5 stars for the show.",

After the show, SPAC limited ticket sales for all future shows for good reason. I'll never forget looking up at the concrete walkways that led into the amphitheatre and seeing a mass of bodies shaking silhouetted against the night.  Had many tearful reunions with friends all throughout the show because the rain and mud and the music made it very confusing.\nGreat show.  Great venue.  Check out 8-1-04 SPAC show for what I consider one of the finest Dead shows post-Jerry.",

We slid on the mudslides after the show.\n\nDefinitely a high energy place.  Energy ripples around the audience in waves, and this tape captures it well.\n\nHighlights ...\n\nMinglewood is very high powered, with a hot Jerry jam.\n\nDeal is always a fun tune, but this one doesn't hold a candle to the next summer's (June 1985) Greek Theatre Deal, which I also attended.  This one has a couple flubs, and an unimpressive jam.\n\nMiracle is well placed to capture the second set energy of this SPAC crowd, and it is well executed.  Phil sounds like he's firing cannon shots into the audience, and Jerry has that mean and fast Minglewood-style tone.  I remember seeing the drummers from a distance and thinking that they looked like a well-oiled machine, cranking along in perfect symmetry.  The whole band looked like a brand-new, shiny engine firing on all cylinders.  They didn't jam much on this Miracle, but it was fun anyway.\n\nBertha keeps up the forward momentum and keeps the crowd's energy up.  Jerry's jam is crisp and fast, with a nice friendly ring to it.  Not perfect or inspired, but fun anyway.  Phil lets off a few smaller cannon shots, but nothing like Miracle.  \"Rainstorm\" gets a well deserved roar.\n\n... to be continued ....",

We'd had a nice little crowd of people dancing to us underneath one of the covered walkways outside the venue while it rained all afternoon. I remember security held down the fort on the concrete walkways until halfway through Hell in a Bucket. I was standing right near the entrance to the walkway when the crowd broke through. I didn't think that was right, but it was also kind of inevitable. I remember hearing Phil suddenly pounding on the bass, and I wondered if it ticked him when he saw a river of heads suddenly flowing into the venue, obviously from across the protected walkways.. nevertheless I jumped into the breach with others. I saw the rest of the show from way in the back up under the top of the shed. I saw where my companions were sitting and obviously getting soaked. I also saw the limo leaving at the end. China Doll was the highlight for me. I thought Jerry really gave us something rare and soulful in his vocal performance on that one.",

After my high school graduation ceremony my frinds Cotter and Chris Luppi convinced me to drive us from Bedford N.Y to Saratoga in my 1973 Superbeetle.\n\nWe showed up with our graduation money and hooked everything up, got lawn seats and doses. When the show started I lost my friends and just was dancing with everyone.\n\nI had been an athiest but i bonded with a tree and realized a higher power had to have made the thing.\n\nThen I saw the older brother of one my friends Keith Grover, he was Chris Grover and one of the coolest heads in town.\n\nHe had always been aloof.  But when he saw me dancing in the rain in the same state of mind he was in.. We hugged and I pulled a joint out of my pocket and we tried to smoke it in the rain but it pretty much dissolved.  We laughed so hard and it didn't matter.\n\nWe hung out the rest of the show and after that I was in with the biggest head in Pound Ridge, back then connections made you cool.\n\nThe show ended and we parted and I walked through golf courses in the pouring rain back to my superbeetle.\n\nI had put the key for itin the change pocket of my Levis.\n\nWhen I got to my car I was so happy, there was a girl there and I said, \"My car, I found my car\" and I was sooo high.  she said \"do you have the keys to your car\" and I pulled the key out of my change pocket\" and she laughed and we hugged\n\nThen I got in my superbeetle and got in the back seat.  i had a change of clothes, a mexican blanket and a cooler full of food and orange juice.  I took off all my clothes and put on the dry clean clothes,ate some bread, apples and peanuts and opend a container of tropcana orange juice... pure bliss\n\nI also had some \"sense\" and a pipe and I smoked out.  This was Nirvana.\n\nThen there was a knock on the window and it was Chris and Cotter.

The morning of the show my friend was carrying out one of the mattresses and by accident hit the fire alarm and set it off. So, evacuation in place..one of the maids came into the bathroom to get my friend out of the shower..his leg was broken and hanging out of the shower. Real funny scene...Every fire truck in the town was outside with deadheads everywhere. As for the show...fun time with alot of energy...lightning storm during this fine wharf rat. I met a girl from Rye, NY on one of the balcony ramps... we danced in the rain...needless to say I had a fun rest of the summer with her...this show is great...ended up getting home at 5am to the sun coming up.

Dancin' was out of the blue for me and a really great opener. Would never know Garcia was a total mess from this show, except his voice, which was pretty shot.  Brent was on fire on Minglewood, and save for Weir's disastrous foray's into slide guitar, a great version. The Miracle>Bertha was a great transition. Another unexpected opener, for me a least. Really wonderful memory of this show. I think the rain added alot of electricity. Bummer Phil's bass does not come through on the recording, though.",

My buddy Wil Kezema I were dropped off at the intersection of route 35 and 684...by my mom (Hester) where my mom helped me make a sign out of cardboard with GRATEFUL DEAD in black letters and roses on each corner!  Got picked up by two dude from Dartmouth in a camero or some smaller sporty car.  We smoked good weed, spoke about what to expect for the show...it was super scary, but also super cool.  Kind like when you first jumped off Castle Rock!  Once we arrived at the Spac...the dudes hooked up with two pieces of blotter / acid. The rain came down, people were jumping the fence, they opened with dancin in the streets...it was magical.  After the show we caught a ride in the back of a pickup truck that dropped us off at 35.  We were freezing our ass off during the ride down (it was still raining) and this dude handed us a bag from inside the truck.  It was a big United States Flag which Wil and I wrapped around us.

The several days on the road was a great adventure for us.  The crowd was huge, but we had a good spot half way up the hill and took in the great show, got a little wet and had a fun time dancing in the mud.  It was one of the shows I will never forget, and as I recall was one of the larger concerts of the time. We didn't hurry to get out after the show figuring we would let the traffic jam subside. I will never forget sitting on the tailgate and the police just walked by and smiled at us.....or I think they were riding horses......which is what lead me to find this website while my wife was telling me about the triple crown and how she went to Saratoga as a child.
