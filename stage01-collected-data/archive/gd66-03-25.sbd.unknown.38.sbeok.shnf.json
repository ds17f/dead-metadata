It would be just perfect if we could stitch them together to make an original lost version, but it is not to be.  \n\nEven though the cuts are in very similar places, there is one line of overlap.  If you listen carefully to that line, you'll hear that they are different performances.  The organ in the mix is very different, but it is not just that 2.25 has been equalized, or anything.  No, they are two truly different versions.\n\nBy cosmic coincidence both versions are messed up in perfectly complementary ways.  Yet they are not the same version.  An amazing chance discovery in perfect keeping with the strange life of our favorite band.",

This method works.\n\nHe must have run Blue Ron's keys thru the P.A. 'cuz it is prevalent in the mix, and, this is exactly what it sounded like then ~ standing ten feet from them. At some of those gigs there was no stage. It was akin to a giant, weird Frat Party.\n\nWe were young and foolish even those old and wise.\n\nAnd how foolish are we yet?\n\nHere I am listening to these songs from almost 45 years ago. What does that say about the long lingering affect? What does it say about me?\n\nThe Grateful Dead clearly demonstrate in this performance that they were going to someday dominate and eclipse the number of documented live recordings. No band in the history of recorded music has ever come close to approaching the number of sonic facsimiles this band has produced. It is a most amazing feat and not one that the \"Recording High Society\" was apt to consider music. How could something so wretchedly awful continue to captivate our ears?\n\nAh, another mystery!\n\nThe mere fact that a 60 year old person could derive or extract extreme pleasure out of this show is because it is the kind of music that shall prevail.\n\nIf you listen closely, there exists twixt Jerry Bobby and Phil an astounding \"surf\" guitar extravaganza going on throughout. And if it sounds fast it is because they played fast back in those days. The speed of this show needs no speed correction.\n\nThis is such a beautiful re-visitation of this night.",
