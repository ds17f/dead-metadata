He does not recall any of the songs played. Can anybody else confirm this as the show?  Anyway it is a great show the other reviews do it justice.",

But it doesn't hold a candle to the 5-6-70 version which includes at least three fantastic peaks that rise from the collective uberMind of the band to steal your face, pull your pants down, and kick your axx.\n\nThe very mellow Friend of Mine is a sweet follow up.  The St. Stephen rocks mightily.  The New Potato Caboose (sniffle) is sublime. \n\nFinally, this show is yet another reminder that Garcia's voice is simply one of the most original and beautiful voices in late 20th century popular music and he's in good form here.\n\nSound quality is excellent.",

      "review_text": "Whoa... UPDATE 7/7/05:\n\nI'd have to disagree with you there on the 5/6/70 Dancin' being better. It's great, of course, and it has the Tighten Up jam. But I think it's way too slow and, at 17 minutes, a bit overstretched. This one is FAST, FOCUSED (unlike some Dead jams) and the jam is some of the best Grateful Dead you will ever hear. It is very obvious that everyone is listening to each other VERY CAREFULLY and the X-Factor is achieved. The sonic landscape that they paint is that of some of the best free-form jamming I've ever heard, by any group (and I've been listening to the Dead for more than a decade). Other jam bands like Phish can only dream of jamming like this without their pointless looping devices or sound effects to fall back on. \n\nAlong the way, Jerry pulls of some of the best guitar solos I've ever heard; constant flurries of  Mixolydian-based mayhem. The guitar lick from roughly 4:58 to 5:03 is spellbinding, reminding you that he wasn't your typical rock/blues guitarist. To the reviewer that implies that this Dancin' is not great because the band follows Jerry's every move, I say that's EXACTLY the reason that this jam is so great. The interplay is telepathic; it's as if they were reading his mind. Now any guitarist knows that his solo lines were not that of your typical Clapton/Hendrix-type blues. They were jagged, complex and even a little sloppy, so it was difficult to follow and/or predict what he would play before  he played it, making this jam all the more amazing since the whole group plays as one. Even more crazy is the fact that his Dancin' is the first-known time played since 3/3/68 and makes the earlier version of this song from '66-'68 seem like Cheese Whiz. \n\nNow the 5-star rating is for the Dancin' alone, since the rest of the show, no matter how strong, could not measure up to the first set opener. However, the rest is very good with the early China Cat and the last New Potato. Great Cryptical>Other One>Cosmic Charlie to close out the set.",

The quality degrades a little after MAMU.\n\nNew Potato might be one of the most unheralded compositions the Dead ever did. The changes and jamming and bass solo.....",

I've always loved this psychedelic folk song, and this particular version is delivered with such love and attention to dynamics that I doubt I will find it done better. Jerry does such an awesome job on vocals and well thought out lead guitar solos that I always have to play it twice. This is not the same song as the Byrds did by the same title. It has the same tune but the Byrds song was about JFK and his assasination in Dallas. The apolitical Dead version is my favorite. Listen to the show for this song at least.

A band that takes LSD and plays together as much as these guys did, exist on a different plain of consciousness. The creativity and emotional investement is glowing and obvious, and that's not a hallucination on my part, or atleast I hope not.",
