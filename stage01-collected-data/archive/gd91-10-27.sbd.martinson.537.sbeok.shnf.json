I gather he was especially close to Bill Graham and understand the Dead chose to open this show with Sugar Mags b/c it was Bill's favorite. Then there was not a dry eye in the Coliseum during the appropriate and touching Knockin' encore. Great memories of a great show and BGP era. Thank you Bill.",

Sugar Mag opener of course, (the SSDD closed the Dead's set at the official memorial about a week later) and we all cried. TOG \"we will survive\" another touching moment to end the 1st set. Awesome Iko jam into Mona...listen for Jerry starting to sing \"Hey Bo Diddley\" b4 Bobby takes the lyrics.  Sidenote:the 6-cd jerry retrospective has a studio jam version of Bo Diddley.  Duncan and Santana tore up the jam as Jerry was ever the gracious musician and laid back.  Heaven's Door closed what was likely one of the most emotionally-charged shows in the band's history.

      "review_text": "One the best shows I ever saw! 1991 was a really good year.  Sadly, we lost Bill.  I remember lots of folks back in 80s and 90s used to talk down about Bill because of increases in ticket prices, more and more restrictions on the scene in the parking lots and a bunch of other stuff like his very pro-business orientation.  However, the truth is that without Bill, much of what went on with entire SF scene and the Airplane, Santana and especially the Dead would never have happened.  So, it was only fitting the boys sent Bill out in style with these shows.  I'll never forget a moment of any of them.  The show in the Park that capped this run was incredibly full of emotion: both joy and sadness.  This first show was a great, great show.  One thing I haven't seen in the reviews is any mention of Gary Duncan coming out to play!  He's incredible during Mona, simply taking us back in time to the Fillmore.  Santana came out too.  It was such a great night.  Opening with Bill's fave and then ripping out the Sunshine Daydream in the Park on a beautiful sunny day.  Thanks so much for posting this show.",

      "review_text": "This One For \"The Captain\" With Determination This one is for Bill done with respect and conviction. The boys are determined to play unerringly, and they succeed with all elan'.\n\nYet, they are not so somber as what would wont evening sorrow, no, they shall not give themselves over to grief, but to ecstasy. As a result of such conviction, this is a show that is great from the get-go to the last breath.\n\nBy my recollection, the only time Bill Graham ever  called a rock and roll band, \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band of all time\" and \"They're the greatest band that there ever was\" was when he said that about our Grateful Dead back in 1974, during the filming of the Movie, and again, in 1978 during the Closing of Winterland. Perhaps these were two very significant times for the expression of personal connection 'tween the Boys and Bill. And he did say it best. \"They're the greatest band there ever was.\"\n\nThis show says that. \n\nAnd more.\n\nEvery song.\n\nThere is no Sunshine Daydream! I can't recall, did anyone else notice?\n\nThere is no ending. There is only a new\n\nBeginning.\n\nStart right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIf you listen carefully to the stage banter, you will hear the band joking with each other and having a really good time of yukking it up, admittedly for Bill. It was their way of handling the pain.\n\nSugMag>Sugaree, Walkin, Althea, Masterpiece, Candy, a cascading Cassidy and Touch are all well-played, determinedly well-played, for Bill. You can hear it in every song. This is one of the most flawless first sets that I have heard from this era. And, save for the over-enthused caused clam on the final crescendo of Touch's final chorus, I will bet the second set is not a comedown!\n\nAnd, of course, it isn't. All of it superb and casting into Ship of Fools. Bill Graham was the captain, and the champion for the Grateful Dead.\nAnd here we're are all once again. New Cycle. And...\n\nNew beginning's made alive! For right now, listening to this, and simultaneously realizing that it was later than I thought when I first believed you. Now i cannot share your laughter.\"\n\n\"Oh, ye, of little faith.\" \n\n\"The mustard seed planted will grow. If you could but believe the size of a mustard seed, it would produce a tree whose roots would move mountains.\"\n\nThe additions of guest musicians makes for some interesting moments. Iko has the most wickedly and nasty Jerry solo, evil as much as uplifting, for...it would all resolve....into...Mona!\n\nOh, my Jerry G.! He was for the first and only time decidedly louder in the mix. He just takes over like King Kong stomping through the village.\n\"This is for you, Bill. Thanks.\"\n\nAnd all the rest, all of the second set: great ~ right down to the last drop of that kool-aid.\n\nEvery square inch of this performance and recording is magnificent. \n\nI must go down on record as this show being reckoned as one of the greatest shows they ever played. \n\nThere exists one final question: Is there video?\"",

The boys did come through, we didn't know it at the time but 10/31/91 would be the last shows us westsiders would see with Bruce. Speaking of BH ( take a listen to what he does in Sugar Mags ) after \" take me and I wander ' round \" the band does a couple of rounds before Bruce takes the Rogers Hornsby bust ( Old time HOF baseball player- no relation to BH) that he kept on his piano and chucks it into the crowd then completely pounded the living daylights outta the ivories esp w the left hand! I also remember him standing up for his funky Korg M1 piece during Mona ( what a treat ) great run of shows 10/30/91 pre drums was good but the rest kinda meh.\n 10/28 was killer I tthought.. Esp liked the jam outta Playin ( sans Jerry) everyone\nWhich was too bad he split from that. Everyone mentions 10/28 for the B.G.P opener but I swear Billy and Mick recreated a helicopter crash into high tension wires during rhythm devils!\n( listen for yourself) \n\nThe only thing I can say about 10/31/91 was its was the closest thing to an acid test they did since 65! \" Buffalo Bill is DEFUNCT!\nRIP Bill Graham Jerry Garcia Ken Kesey and Vinny W.",
