The highlight is the Dark Star: A quiet noodly start gets to verse 1 pretty quickly, then gets really wonderful with a long section of jingly bells, wind-like cymbals, tweets, screetchs, and other jungle-like sounds.  Some very melodic sustained feedback where Jerry sounds like a cello gives way to a series of very structured chord sequences and jamming that is like a collection of mini-songs.  They almost sound recognizable, although the only one I could identify is a proto-Eyes jam.  Just really interesting and fun.",

The Dead may have been playing the same songs over and over during this period, but show some real versatility when doing so....dark star here is a serious conversation between members of the band.  My favorite Grateful Dead!!!!!!  The china cat rocks too......download and kick back-------it does take a real ear to seperate all of these versions of the same songs show in and show out        cymbals on morning dew are many",

China Cat ain't bad...but during Morning Dew i thought they were going to completely lose it a few times.  I say only download the second disk and move on.",

Jerry shows us his brilliance as he leads the band and makes them work hard to keep up with his creativity. Some unchartered territory, for the times, are explored here. Maybe playing in the intimate setting, in front of family and friends, was the impetus to create. Ceratinly one of the most interesting Dark Star's of '69, broken string and all, with Jerry tuning up mid jam.",

Another creative \"Dark Star\" with a proper, long, ambient break after the verse. \n\nAnd, for what it's worth, what sounds like a broken-string incident about three-quarters of the way through, with the band vamping (TC on organ?) as Garcia restrings and recovers.",

The opening jam slowly unfolds up to one of those \"whirls\" that opens a spiral-vortex hole in space-time, and out pours the first verse. The crowd  is totally dialed into it; it is rare to hear such a clear and respectful silence. The post-verse jam is deliciously interstellar. The transitional jam is burning until Jerry breaks a string; then we get to hear some unusually great leads from TC (he's really on point for this show). Jerry's return is one of those classicly chaotic and focused Dead moments. Excellent recording, excellent vibe on my sister's birthday show in San Francisco",

Classic.  \n\nEasy Wind falls apart...but Pigpen keeps singing in time and brings it all back together then hands it over to Garcia for a solo. \n\nGarcia calmly and patiently comes in several bars later and funks the whole groove so intensely that it's like his guitar is speaking and talking in tongues...Man, Jerry could make things come alive...and the EW groove is reborn. \n\nDARK STAR into feedback into DARK STAR, 28 Minutes & 58 seconds long. It doesnt' get any better than this. Crank it up...and watch out, you can lose your mind in there...\n\nThe rest of the show is very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. \n\n5 stars for recording, and mix. 5 stars for performance. \n\nEat, drink, be merry and listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD.\n\nThanks for the Love.",

      "review_text": "a half-hour of heaven in an off-kilter show This show has an outstanding Dark Star, one of my favorites of '69 - very sweet and majestic and creative - Jerry starts it with delicious feedback and it just climbs from there. \nThey do get rather loose as they near the end - but when they get into St Stephen, they come completely unhinged as Jerry stops playing - I think this must be the only Stephen where he doesn't play the solo, but instead just gives peals of feedback where the solo should be! \nIn spite of this, the rest of the band barrels on into The Eleven, and plays most of it without him! Certainly a unique bare-bones Eleven. Finally he gets his guitar working again, but only plays a little bit before they decide to give up, and it's time for a drum solo! \nFinally they confuse the patient audience by finishing with an early, tentative High Time. \nThis show also features one of the early Easy Winds with a different feel, where they were still learning how to handle the time changes, and one of the strange early transitions from China Cat Sunflower to Doin' That Rag.",

In Defense of Disc One - Don't pass go without it. \n\nSQ A- (tape distortion/wobble last min of China & first min of Rag, otherwise HQ).\n\nShow is a mournful follow after the lighthearted set the night before.

The Dead play with such deep, hard of feeling.\n\nCat is a spirited race into a Rag that does it bluesy, crazy and achy, with mad sadness (never hit/hurt me like that). Dew amazes, as they chase those blues away. Wind starts slow then they lower the hammer. \n\nDark Star is a one hell of a whole lotta journey. SS squeals as it's about to peel out of town.

I've always loved it, ever since I first heard it on Aoxomoxoa, for the clever Alice in Wonderland lyrics and the manic mode changes. On most of the live recordings I've heard, it sounds kind of clumsy. Here, it's deliberate and charged and given solid treatment. Same with Easy Wind, which erupts into an altogether SICK jam before ending on solid footing despite a slightly tentative first few verses. It's the best freakin' Dark Star I've ever heard, too. The BEST. I don't care about the busted string and whatever killed Garcia's axe in St. Stephen. I can't believe anyone gives this show less than a fiver. The quality is insane for the period, too.",
