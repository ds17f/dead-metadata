Most of the songs are great, but a lot of the jamming on disc 2 on and around The Other One is pretty bad I think. It's mostly that chaotic lack-of-melody style that lets down what could be lovely long jams around '73-'74. The Other One is all instrumental which is a pity because it has great verses.\n\nThe 3 I give this show is in relation to other GRATEFUL DEAD shows. So its a pretty damn good listen as a whole, but there's loads of better stuff out there.",

Unfortunately, it's heavily overshadowed by the giant that preceeds it, 11/11, and the masterpiece of 11/17 that follows. But don't overlook this little magic mushroom. Energetic versions of Cumberland, China>Rider and HC Sunshine stand out. And while the Other One may not travel anywhere particularly new, it definitely satisfies your jam needs. Sometimes you buy the less expensive wine, this is that show. But the vintage is still a very magical year.\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

Thus I defer to his observation and revise downward. Still a more than adequate snack, tho...\n\nCrispy first set with a shimmering Sunshine & fluid China/Rider, the latter separated by sweet interstitial marmelade jam. Starts tight and stays tight throughout. \n\nSecond set Other One excursion a most worthwhile journey. Agreed, not on the melodic side -- but The Other One rarely is, and this surging jam ebbs and flows tightly in and out of Big River, a luscious Eyes, to dock smoothly at the Wharf. This ain't everyday noodlin', kids, but a fat sandwich with all the sides AND a bag o' chips. \n\nSound quality is stellar, with bass and keys exceptionally well defined; in fact, the mix is so good I doubt they would bother to clean it up for an official release, since it's so close already. Don't go hungry -- this download will take care of those munchies pronto.",

Well this 69 minute Truckin thru Wharf Rat sure didn't disappoint. I had never heard this show before and knew very little about it and I've been collecting shows for 10 years. Why? Because it's literally surrounded by two stellar shows, 11/11 and 11/17. I'd have to say that this is one of the great overlooked performances, much like 5/11/72 overshadows the superb 5/10/72 (is it a coincidence that this and 5/10 feature great versions of the Other One). \n\nI'd say this gets 5 stars for the third disc alone, and the sound quality is phoenominal, every little detail (from Bill's crash cymbal to Phil's low E string) crystal clear. Definitely get it now.",

The common formula for a 73' show was followed here and it worked well. hctss and the cowboy tunes ARE skippable by all means... the cumberland was a swell treat, but it has seen better days. I absolutley love 73 thats why im trying to mention the bad parts of the show, cos the YOU KNOW with a second set like this... the show is gonna be a full of facemelters. sound not perfect... some \"warm up\" versions in set I...

The fact they tossed out 16 songs in the first set was the result of some toasty pre show activities. Not to mention a 90 minute jam to open the 2nd set with 3 Other Ones. Not a show ever played had 3 Other Ones that I can recall. Add on another 3 songs and you had one incredible evening. I know the Dark Star on 11/11 at Winterland was vintage Dead and the long Playing/Uncle John's/Morning Dew jam at Pauley on 11/17 was quite festive; but for me, the night belonged to the Dead and they played very inspired that evening. The fans realized this when the first set took nearly 2 hours to play. Oh, as far as the chair was concerned, I think Phil was just a tad too inibriated to stand for the 90 minute jam to open set 2.",

The Sunshine in the first set is dripping with goo.  GOO!\n\nLet's be honest, folks.  The fall of '73 is the bomb shit.  I think it's fucked up and inhumane that the Archive removed many of the soundboards from this tour (pending another Dick's Picks or Vault release perhaps?).\n\nAnyway, if you like 'em mellow, this one is a must.",

All around rating, 5-stars... the band was tight, good energy and upbeat, vocals are nice and clear, great sound quality, Keith is at his best, and Jerry plays some interesting and lovely melodic riffs throughout... that I thought were a bit spunky... like in Sugaree and Tennessee Jed.\n\nI've listened to many of the late '72 to late '73 shows here on the LMA... not all. This show is a gem. I discovered it purely by chance, and a bit of good effort by all. I went to about 25 Dead concerts during this period, on the east coast. I think this show is rated way under the radar, my deadhead friends. It's excellent throughout.\n\nI just met this great lady my age. She only saw the Dead a couple of times, many years ago. I'm setting her up now... so that she can listen to the Dead, here on the LMA. She wanted me to recommend one show to listen to now... so she could hear them again, for the first time in years. Believe it or not, I recommended this show. It epitomizes the best of the Dead in this era.",

The vocals in HCS are spot on, and I oftentimes get annoyed that the harmonies are out of pitch or lagging in tempo, but the boys nailed it this night. And the jam sequence is jazzy and laid back. Listen to Bill on the drums, super slow and restrained in the first few minutes with low toms and snare, then starts to put it into high gear as the jam builds splashing the cymbals and using cyncopated rhythms on the snare. Great interplay between Keith and Bobby, feeding off of each other, and then Jerry really coming in on top of them at his own speed. Of course Phil keeps a solid foundation. \n\nWish I was there!",

Also the Other One sandwich in set 2 is amazing and just as brilliant as the PITB sandwich on 11/20. In particular I LOVE the transition from TOO into Eyes, and what a Eyes it is. Not just a typical '73 version - this is played with that '74 energy and gusto - complete with sick Phil runs towards the end, as every good late '73-'74 Eyes should have. \nAlso I agree this HCS is good but not great.
