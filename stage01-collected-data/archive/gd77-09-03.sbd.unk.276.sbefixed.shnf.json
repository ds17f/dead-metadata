I remember the sea of mud which lead to the water spickets, the pregnant women being lifted out by a helicopter, Donna recovering sitting on a stool and Mickey with a small cast on his arm.Were were boxed in by Railroad cars that made gate crashing a challenge.It was the largest amount of people I have ever been around. There was a solid MTB following ( real popular in Jersey 75-78 before they got too into the pop sound) who seemed to filter out when the Dead took the stage.I have no memory of NRPS,Jungle biscuits were in abundance then. THe weather was a factor plus they hadn't been playing as regular for the last month or so. All that aside, the show had awesome moments of the Anthem of the year  \"Eyes\"was fabulous,There were more air guitar playing on that tune than any other in my day! :). Yes we played an inordinate amount of frisbee listening to this tape. The jam out of He's Gone>NFA was special since the playing had been minus significant jamming since 74 era.Performance was a 4, sound was 4 there  with all the different versions circulating the Dicks Picks offers the best.. Being the pirate that I am, I would still go out at purchase this show.We had the FM version, I taped it off the radio, thnx to WNEW, I do remember the older freaks freakin out when they played truckin (rather weak but first one since 9-28-75THe dead heads made the Cover of the New York Times!!!

I've had it for 25 years and I still listen to it.\n\nIf you haven't heard this you should seek it out, or buy the Dick's Picks, as there are some landmark versions here for the era. \n\nFor me, this show is about three in particuliar (although The Music Never Stopped crushes too, as most do from '77): Miss 1/2 Step, Eyes and Not Fade Away. \n\nIt's all about Jerry dialing away at that secret combination that springs the lock to the great wide open. Hearing him break on through during Eyes is scheer beauty and a moment every 'Head lives for. It's the \"solo on top of the solo\" break through. The Half Step really swings here- one of my top 3 for '77 (and all time, really). The NFA clocks in at just over 20 minutes. Talk about grindin' it...down and dirty Jerry goes on for days here.\n\nChatter from the FM tape: End of set 1: Jerry-\"Don't anybody go anywhere...we'll be right back!\" Weir- \"You'all hang out and make friends with the bugs\". After Estimated someone (Phil?) says \"Weir, wait until the drum solo's over\". But he's already into Eyes, can't pull up and in place of a drum duet(?) later that day we get the killer NFA.\n\nThe Head count for this show was estimated at 150K. I still have an aerial picture (from newspaper or Rolling Stone?) inserted in the front of my tape.",

The loser is the best i've ever heard, and the same goes for this NFA. This entire second set is filled with gems, and I must say I think this could be one of the best estimated>eyes ever. The transition is unlike any other i've heard. And for this amazing 2nd set, this show gets 5 stars. Might not be as overall good as Barton in the end, but this is a top 3 '77 show in my mind.",

Not one review even mentions the most staggeringly heart ripping bliss opening delightfulness of ever seeing what I never ever saw at more than 100 other shows EVER - Jerry and Bobby facing off face to face doing that dueling guitar stuff practically spatting and sweating and drenching each other with their surrenderfull souls twin merging.nation NFA!! in front of us front row Motherchukkers!!  Then during the Trucking Bobby and JERRY  i mean JERRY GARCIA ar side by side like chorus girls from Radio City strutting and strumming all the way across the entire GIANT stage front to the part of slamming trucking that they go at the end like dahdahdahdada deedada de DAH DAH boboobah debooba debooba de DOO DA DA!!  with their synchronized dancing legs kicking at the end I mean were any of you reviewers close enough to SEE!!!????  The last entire ONE HOUR of this mystically rich deep thick magical evening healing the entire ALTOMONTE Raceway Demons for once and for all -at a DRAG STRIP (sounds sexy!!) the last  entire hour is only 4 - thats right right one hour is only 4 songs - do you understand now what we were doing that night after two days of the ordeals and the fun NRPS and the ACID kicking in now CANT YOU SEE Marshall Tucker Band what that woman been doing to me!!  FUCK BARTON HALL for once and all - nobody listening can tell why the crescendoss are the key to Barton's adulation and praise - of course Morning Dew is perfectly awesome but remove COCAINE  and your crescendos sound more surprising and unexpected and touch your heart more - Englishtown the Coke cowboys had no chance with the humidity and heat and utter survivl conditions there 9 Babies like Woodstock - dehydration tents overflowing - toilets spewing leaks and ponds of piss (Back then a guy could just whip it out and pee without some brain damaged PC jerk screeching at him - nowadays you guys go to DEAD Shows in UNIFORMS of tie dye - wtf!!!????  Englishtown I saw 25 tie dyes out of 160,000 people (underestimate)  we crashed the gates the night before and we had tickets!? when we crashed the gates and ran for the stage it was 10pm and already over 2000 bodies blocked us from our front row spots until the sun came up and the acid got dropped and we all looked at each other quizzickly as curiosities instead of the smug certainty and lack of subversiveness common amongt the After-Jerry-Died crowd - Thank God Billy K is still alive - he gets it - ask him about Labor Day weekend New Jersey 1977 Englishtown - BILLY brought somebodies Harley up next year in Jersey Labor Day The Giants Stadium weekender with pre-Egypt vibes and Billy K playing drums with a cast on his wrist - he was throwing drumsticks at guys for all the fucking stupid reliance on constant coke snorting that made Bobby think he could learn slide on stage and made Bobby think the Dead were a pop band covering Elvis and chasing teen girlz - yikes I miss you JERRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "review_text": "One Day Only (...only...only) <br />\"The Summer's End Concert\", as it was billed, was not actually in Englishtown, but The Old Bridge Raceway Park was marketed at the time as \"Raceway Park \u2013 Englishtown, in Old Bridge\"*. This has always made my list of the five overrated shows. Like the others, not because it's not good, but because it's not, overall, a top ten of all time (or the year). We all used to think it was, because it was well-circulated and for many of us our first '77 tape. It was also a bootleg vinyl called \"Good Lovin'\" (which oddly had the Good Lovin' from 7/2/71). It's about as famous as Barton or Veneta, and used to be legendary for the size of the show \u2013 a colossal mass of people corralled inside a ring of cargo containers on a day of soaring heat index (so glad to hear it on tape instead). They chose the site because it's just 20mi to NYC and just 60mi to Philly. They played 15 mi away at Middlesex College in '70 [a missing tape], and 19mi away at Princeton in '71. John Scher went to Amboy and hired stevedores to bring hundreds of <a href=\"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/JQ2GQFRPZVG67KNI4YR2FEU7IE.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\">shipping containers</a> and encircle the area end-to-end so there were no gatecrashers, and it set the record for most tickets sold at a NJ concert [<a href=\"https://i.redd.it/coe9y7ywoux31.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">107,000</a>]. The dirt field <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/j0g3yabvilky.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">became mud</a> by the evening. There were two deaths, two births and a helicopter crash (with a woman down front in labor, only Deadheads would self-part into perfect columns for an ambulance!). Due to a traffic mishap that nullified the parking lots, and retaliatory intervention from some townships, parking was 1 to 3 miles away. In these days aerial advertising was popular and a flying banner repeatedly urged Heads to join the army! They didn't use state-of-the-art sound delays [lag towers], like at Summer Jam (Watkins Glen), and the crowd way at the back beyond the speaker towers never heard the two opening bands \u2013 and could marginally hear the Dead \u2013 so of course people surged forward. \n\nThis was the 1st show in 3mos, after the summer tour was cancelled when Mickey was injured rolling his Porsche. Ironically, one year later it was Billy's turn to get laid up and play in a cast. While Mickey was out Donna had a surgery and only decided at the last minute to appear for some songs. It was a one-off booking \u2013 the tour wouldn't start for a few weeks. This was the 1st gig where Keith only brought electric-based keys. Jer played his Travis Bean TB500, now modded with two outputs (effects loop moved onboard). This show probably gets the \"overrated\" tag more than any other, and Jarnow noted that he never really got this show, since it was \"too big & shouty & not jamming\". Tapes usually circulated incomplete, hissy and ill-pitched and hearing those I used to think it was a fun batch, but with plenty of flubs and squelch. Now with better sources I split the middle and see that there is one great set and one average (which is to be expected given the extreme temps and bug swarms). Heads already know it anyway. For newcomers, the highlights are grand.\n\nFirst Set. They were clearly very ready to go on. Though Bobby flubs <i>Promised Land</i>, this was a good choice for opener for this crowd and they go for a straight version. Conversely, <i>They Love Each Other</i> is like Swiss clockwork. <i>Me & My Uncle</i> is a superb version (still lying, not dead ass again until next show). Jer plays a Country Gardens tuning during Bobby's \"take a step back\". <i>Mississippi Half-Step</i> emerges exemplary; everyman edition, easily (exactly existential). <i>Looks Like Rain</i> is an average take but with nice Jer tone selection for the roaring solo and good Donna. With its two solos, <i>Peggy-O</i> has long been considered a showpiece version (objectively, there are a dozen equals in '77). <i>Minglewood</i> is so vicious that Jer bucks the stall while Keith solos. <i>Friend of the Devil</i> is no slouch and <i>Music Never Stopped</i> is excellent the whole way.\n\nSecond Set. Jer repeats a verse in <i>Bertha</i>, but check out Bobby's fine playing. <i>Good Lovin'</i> is also punchy but more flubby, and they bail early when Bobby starts screaming, having not paced himself well. This is a top version of <i>Loser</i>, with Jer playing for the depth of the crowd and Donna good. Don't worry about the wobbly <i>Estimated</i> because <i>Eyes of the World</i> is worth the wait \u2013 not a top ten for the year but it fits the set nicely. The OFFICIAL removes the halt to the concert while Scher tries to stop people from climbing a speaker tower (some people back there said they never did see the stage). After a solid enough <i>Samson</i>, the  OFF cuts Phil's \"can we take 5mins?\" & Bobby's \"I gotta go get some salt pills!\". They had to take a break from the oppressive heat & humidity and the insects, and left the stage for a bit. It wasn't enough; Jer gets lost a couple times in <i>He's Gone</i>. But it has a nice tempo and the jam into NFA is the show's best. The OFF edits the main flubbed section, removing 2mins13secs @4:16  [4:10>6:23 of MTX]. It also has a different vox mix. <i>Not Fade Away</i> itself is okay. <i>Truckin'</i> is the first one in almost two years and has only a little bit of rust. Bobby strapped on his new 12-string acoustic for the encore, as they had planned to try the Transit>At a Siding section of <i>Terrapin</i> again. It was attempted 3/18, but sans lyrics, then abandoned since that didn't go well. But instead exhausted Mickey winds them down to a stop \u2013 probably a welcome one. \n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0\u00a0A\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 4 stars\n\nHighlights:\nFirst Set - especially Me & My Uncle, Mississippi Half-Step Uptown, New Minglewood Blues\nLoser - long a go-to version\n\nSOURCES: The matrix is wetter/livelier than the OFF, though the mtx_dusborne runs slightly fast. The stiegler_91230 AUD runs way too slow, the minches_91650 is the Wagner AUD re-pitched. The unk_276 is the SBD, but surely the FM tapes still circulate (as does a remastered SBD). <b>Dick's 15</b> has the whole show save a few tunings and an edited version of He's Gone. There is some scattered footage on YouTube; usually a minute of Loser.\n\n*Some posters using other titles are apocryphal and were printed later.",

Some rate based on setlist and others based on mix. \u201877 saw less jamming and more straight forward sets due to the hard driving production on Terrapin. \nThe run of the mill first set songs are dripping with personality. This is one of those big shows they didn\u2019t mess up. \nI\u2019m a method listener. Get into the era. The Dead just got done with April/May/June 77 spring and was fresh having taken some time off. This is the bridge between that time and the often overlooked 78-79 Dead. \nLet\u2019s agree that the Dead invented how monitors of today are used, and didn\u2019t believe in having anyone \u2018up\u2019 in the mix. This is the magic of the GD. \nThis is the soundtrack of my life. \n\nPick up a guitar and learn these songs. Can stumble and play these songs, but not in front of 125K in searing heat and general chaos of a festival. \n\nThe energy is palpable. The Travis Bean seemed to stay in tune this day. The tone and feel carries the day. Donna is mixed well. \n\nThere is good separation and balanced sound. Nothing bad about this 3-hr set ending with colossal songs NFA Truckin and Terrapin. \n\nSome are here for the party and some have the music intertwined with their DNA. \nSome are here to criticize. \n\n9/3/77 is not over nor under rated. It deserves to be ranked alongside other huge festivals played (Watkins Glen) not put up against small intimate venues (Cornell) \n\nGet lost in the intricate details of the first set. Gorgeous music and flowing inflection. The critics here are not able to summons the ability to trust enough or be flexible enough to allow for the beauty of this music to flow. Not just this show or era\u2026 \nNow that we see the forced jams within the jam band scene where everyone is jumping in unison having collective experiences rather than individual journeys- > this music stands out and glows and flows a unique energy. \n\nThis show stands as a treasure and a bridge between the 12-13 years from inception of the band; from organic and raw music to the subsequent 12-13 years to 1990. \n\nEnglishtown stands right in the middle of the band\u2019s existence.
