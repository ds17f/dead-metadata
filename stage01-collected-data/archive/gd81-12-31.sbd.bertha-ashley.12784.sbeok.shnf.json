      "review_text": "Happy New Years!!! I attended every New years show from '80 to '88 and this was by far the best IMO. Between the incredible song list and the inspired playing from start to finish, this show rates as one of the best ever!!!\n\n Jerry did indeed break out the Accoustic guitar for Banks Of the Ohio, but by the end of the first verse had traded it in for his electric.\nThis is the only 4-set show I ever attended, and it was a mind blower. The best time I ever had at a show. As you walked in the Auditorium, there was a floor mural dedicated to Truckin from the year before, when the floor had caved in due to the dancing during Truckin. Graham had a mini volleyball tourney going on before the show inside. \nTo me this show had everything, a killer song list, just about everything you could want to hear with some very sweet surprises. Jerry is right on from the first note to the end of the night, the mix is perfect, you can hear everyone just right and the whole band is tuned in for a truly incredible show. Opening up the 2nd set is one of the greatest versions of Shakedown you will find, 16+ minutes and some very inspired jamming, you'll also find a rare and great mid set Cold Rain, also a nice Big Boss Man (\" I sure Go to barn at night!!)the only distraction of the set was Joan Baez singing overpowering harmony during Roses. \n\nThe third set is epic. After Kesey spends about 6 minutes killing time andd conducting a \"gong Bong\" the countdown commences and the band  powers into a nice rollicking Aiko (It was nice to see something other than Sugar Mag to kick off the Year), followed by a truly inspired Playing >> Terrapin >> Playin sandwich (\"Strategy was his strength, not \"Didaster\"\"). At the end of Playin, it sounds like the drummers were stepping up to go into their bit but Jerry starts the intro and we were treated to a virtually flawless Terrapin, back into Playin. The real treats, however, were left for after drums and the 4th set. It was reminiscent, both song list and playing, of a 70-72 jam. The space is long and inspired with Jerry absolutely taking the lead and flows effortlessly into a mean Other One > NFA.> Goin Down the Road, which warmed us up for a truly inspiring Dew that soared through the darkness, and perfectly ended the set, leaving us with anticipation for what might come.\n When the boys came out again, I think many were expecting a short extended encore, but, man were we in for a surprise. The whole place erupted as Phil and Jerry broke out the intro to Dark Star. this is a fairly short Star, about 14 min, but quite inspired, with some very sweet leads and interplay with the band. Jerry is crisp throughout, the band is right there with him and this performanceis as close to flawless as you will ever hear for this song. into a rocking Bertha/Good love. The lowlight of the evening was Baby Blue, nicely played, but with Joan once agin providing overpowering, annoying harmonies.This show to me is the quintessential Dead show, great song selection, great musicianship and 4 sets.",

      "review_text": "Best show 1980-1988 I don't often give 5 star reviews to 80's shows (89 Dark Stars excepted), but this one gets one even though the Dark Star is almost an afterthought.  Shakedown is one of those versions I always wanted to hear live but never did.  What more needs to be said about the second set?  A fast and long (15 min) Playin', and then another Playin' jam and reprise after Terrapin - intense playing (note the lower case).  The way space builds into TOO is notable, and then comes a very hot NFA.  Goin' Down the Road is a best ever version - can't make an acronym out of it, it's that good.  And then a Dew closer!  And then a third set with Dark Star!!\n\nSound quality is excellent.  About the only negative of this show is the dying cat sound of the harmonica on Iko; a trifling matter.",

At the end of the day, I'm a bigtime Keith fan; sure, Pigpen's an iconic figure & important player in the legend that is (was?) the Grateful Dead, T.C. was, er . . . well (to tell you the truth I'm not sure what he was all about), but Keith was The Man! \n\nNo one could tickle the ivories like him, & IMHO he was the perfect accompanist to Garcia's guitar. That said, Brent is great on this version of GDTRFB. But perhaps the best reason to check out this show is to listen to Joan Baez join Jerry during the encore; have you ever heard anything so bad? I wonder what Garcia was thinking as he stood there next to her?!?!\n\nA previous poster said something to the effect of \"at least she's not as bad as Donna!\" Listen, on her worst night Donna sounds like an angel compared to Baez! In fact, I'll go so far as to say that if Joan Baez had been a permanent member of the Grateful Dead, they would never have made it as a band! I don't know if Joan knows how to spell \"harmony\", but I can tell you that she definitely doesn't know how to sing with it! Uugh!! Yech!!",

It was obvious that Garcia especially just did not seem to be able to click.  It sounded was flat and awkward.\n\nThen!  They started their set with Shakedown Street and it seemed that all Jerry's pent up frustration came pouring out in one outstanding performance.  After trading fours with Brent, Garcia had his head down and he dug in with one long steady blistering crescendo that had us screaming.  He was on fire!  It was as if he was saying, \"Enough of this crap, let's jam!\"  Afterwards he had this big grin workin' and the show was on!\n\nAfter that, the boys cooked up one fine New Year's night.

      "review_text": "Awesome New Year's Show -- 'DA BOMB!! THIS SHOW FRICKING KICKS ASS, MATE!!  RFKROX IN 'DA HOUSE!\n\nThis show is, without a doubt, one of the smoothest and clearest shows I\u2019ve ever heard!  If I had of attended this show, I would have been stoned-to-da-bone, jammin\u2019, dancin\u2019, and cruisin\u2019 all night long, man!  5 stars and A+ recording quality, for sure.  Who cares about the 1st acoustic set not being available?  That doesn\u2019t warrant rating this show \u201c0\u201d stars like BrianE, fredg, and Buzzoff rated it.  Those 3 reviews suck!!  Actually, the 1st acoustic is available on the first soundboard of this date and on speedingarrow if you want it.  But you just have to know what you\u2019re doing to access it!\n\nI\u2019m rating this show from the 2nd set on.   Shakedown Street is off-the-hook to start this set!  One of the best versions I\u2019ve ever heard, and 16-1/2 minutes long!  For all the hoopla about the 70\u2019s Dead (which is certainly warranted), these early 80\u2019s shows were awesome, especially with Brent Mydland finding his groove.  All of these songs are awesome in Sets #2-4.  Me and My Uncle, Mexicali Blues, Cold Rain and Snow, and Big Boss Man really put Set #2 in high gear.  The third set is absolutely amazing starting with Iko Iko after the countdown to New Year\u2019s, then steamrolling into Playin\u2019 > Terrapin > Playin\u2019 Reprise.  This Drums > Space is unique because it has Jerry playing some cool mellow space guitar before storming into The Other One > NFA > GDTRFB, while ending the set with an awesome Dew (maybe one of the best ever?).\n\nAnd what can you set about Set #4?  Dark Star > Bertha > Good Lovin\u2019 is absolutely ridiculous!!  Just sic, man!!  Even the encore is sweet, with the Boys hooking up with Joan Baez in Dylan\u2019s classic, \u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now, Baby Blue.\u201d\n\nI agree with Purple Gel in his review on the first soundboard of this show.  This just may be the best New Year\u2019s show between 1980-1988.  He said he attended all of them, so that\u2019s pretty impressive.  Moreover, it certainly makes him a reputable authority to review those shows.  Wish I could have said that.  However, I do disagree with his assessment about the encore with Baez.  I actually enjoy listening to her vocals on that song (unlike listening to Donna wailing away on some of the early-mid 70\u2019s Dead shows).  Donna\u2019s best harmonies were clearly during the 1977 peak year before she was booted out of the band with her brother, Keith, after the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum show on 02-17-1979.\n\nI live on the East Coast, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see any of those New Year\u2019s shows that Purple Gel alluded to.  In fact, my first show was at RFK Stadium in D.C. (saw the 6-9 and 6-10-73 shows) and didn\u2019t attend another Dead show until Dylan, Tom Patty, and the Dead played at RFK Stadium on July 6-7, 1986.  Man, was it hot as shit that weekend!  100 degrees!  I only attended 6 Grateful Dead shows, but have seen the Dead 6 times post-Garcia.  5 of those times were at Red Rocks in Colorado in the summer of 2003 (July 6, 7, 8, 10, 11).  Man were those some awesome shows with Joan Osborne!  Talk about a Rocky Mountain High!!  LOL\n\nAnyway, if you want an awesome show with all these amazing sets, then you should download the soundboard.  The energy and sound quality are off-the-hook!  Can\u2019t go wrong with a Grateful Dead New Year\u2019s show!\n\nDanny from Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\nEast-Coast Deadhead\nrfkrox44@hotmail.com\n\nPEACE-OUT!",

NYE '81 is right up there with any show I've ever listened to. If the 15 minute opening Shakedown isn't enough to whip you into a frenzy, I don't know what will. It just continues on from there. Great first set and a mind blowing second set. And just when you think it's over they do a third set with a Dark Star that will make your right toe shoot up in your boot.\nI'm of the opinion that there are two types of Dark Star. One type that's utterly fantastic and the other type that will melt your brain and should come with a \"do not operate machinery\" warning. This one is of the utterly fantastic variety. \nAll the good things you've heard and read about this show are true.\nHang loose and God Bless.",

Best ever rendition of Morning Dew, the sound was so perfect for the space that it was just totally astronomical, took me completely over the galaxy.  Dark Star was a hit because it was the first in many years, but it was disappointingly mellow in retrospect. Overall, the best Grateful Dead New Years concert I ever attended.

      "review_text": "My first New Year's I had been a deadhead since 1978. The Holy Grails to East Coast deadheads, at least, was New Year's Shows and Red Rocks shows.  I had seen my fair share of shows and this being my first New Year's was a big deal for me. I got a ride from a ride board in Seattle and headed south for the shows. I stayed with a college friend and we literally blew up balloons to get into the New Year's show. So, those balloons that fell on your heads were partly from my labor!!\nAnyways, I was able to see three of these and felt very blessed for that. I Loved these shows. Ken Kesey riding down on the joint was fantastic. And the music...I was in heaven.\nI have seen a lot of music looking back. This ranks as one of my favorites and one I fondly recall.",

Thanks for the memories! \ud83d\udc4d",

Played 3 sets with Balloons of Ukrainian Colors drop at midnight. The Palace, Albany Ny.  They blew us away and we danced our asses off. Great neighbors and Band was Outtah' Sight. !!",

I\u2019d just turned 18, was on the bus, and caught each night of this run \u2026 acoustic set opener with three electric sets, highlights for me were a killer Shakedown, Dark Star (people around me hugging, crying) Big Boss Man, and then Ken Kesey swinging from a rope leading us on the \u201cgong bong\u201d and countdown to midnight as Bill Graham rode in the uss Columbia across the crowd. After nearly 4 hrs of music, Bill Graham offered up breakfast; a pastry and apple in bag on the way out. What a night! ",
