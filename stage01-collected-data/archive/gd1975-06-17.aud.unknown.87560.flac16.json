That is too bad and if you havn't heard every show from this fantastic year you are missing out.\nThis benefit for poster artist Bob Fried is an excellent example of the bands style and new sound. If nothing else at least check out the special version of Peggy-O from this excellent audience recording. It is like no other recorded version. Jerry takes his time and really adds alot of pathos to the words and pulls out a  beautiful and stirring guitar solo.\nOther highlights are a wordless Help On The Way, a marvelous Crazy Fingers and an extra spacey Blues For Allah. A great show from a great and under-rated year.",

Sound is good to my ears like jerrys voice in franklins real clear and focused. This music is alot of fun, this is an awesome tape with alot of highlights and rare quality's to it its really one of a kind in a sense because of what a departure this set is from that standard they had built up to in the wall of sound days. If you like Jerry Garcia then this one is a classic this is him still reaching for that next level this was that kind of coalescence where the drugs or band dynamics or whatever it was that drove that thing forward were all properly proportioned to give you a really great final product which was the greatest fucking band in the history of the world. Beautiful technically proficient music, great show.",

Suprised me as Rob is not a fan of post tape edit / eq.. either way grab it its a great source. \n\nMenke and Falanga each pulled this as well from much further up front and it sounds it. Neither circulates ;-) The Menke sounds less 'Winterland-Esque' It is somewhat compressed being those mikes upfront with higher levels... Robs sounds more like what it must have been like to be in Winterland's big box... Vocals are a little bit further back.... They might make a great matrix LOL... I like Rob's a lot for  that. Hearing Winterland sometimes is like an affirmation then at other times a nuisance you choose\n\nThe eq on this is raised a bit on the high end.. It could be the 152 eq settings for high bias still at 120us and bob playing back at 120us rather than at 70us or what Rob did. I would be interested to know... It does seam Dolby decoded I think...\n\nBoth are great.... Look for Bob's some time in the future...\n\nIt is a killer show and for me 75 is so important in the bands history and sound.. There is an excitement in the music with new direction that I think recharged them... I am a real big fan of 75 :-)\n\nThanks Rob for the share!",

It's '75 so they're kinda laid back and mellow for this show but they still crank out some super jazzy jams even if they're not the long spacey kind some prefer.\n\nI think I'll be adding several songs from this show to my favorite versions list.\n\nThe show is enjoyable and the recording is beautiful and clear.

      "review_text": "What a dip Hey Phish man, you must be totally lost in the world of the Dead to try and come to 1975 to look for 5 hour grand stand concerts. Do you know anything about the Dead? 1975 was a hiatus year for the band, people were damn lucky to see them at ALL let alone for an hour and a half set! They were creating killer music around this time and their few concerts of this year were really rehearsals and a way to give their friends a show they were craving. Of course they didn't play long shows, they were out of shape rehearsal wise. Bob Weir said people were going to hear, \"the rustiest band on the earth\", before one of their FOUR 1975 performances! The Dead were not attempting to set longest jam records at these shows. They had a new sound system and new equipment to get used to after they stopped using the Wall of Sound. Bobby and Jerry were playing new custom made guitars (Ibanez and Travis Bean, Bob switched to Boogie amp)and the whole band needed to get the feel of everything again.  I personally am grateful for the beautiful music the band played live this year. Lindley Meadows and Great American Music Hall are up there in my top 20 favorite Dead shows. The live shows of 1975 were creative bursts, they were not well rehearsed, and in this case it was a SURPRISE set! The band wanted to perform their new music that desperately needed to be heard in a live setting! I would never start out here when looking to get into the Dead. Try '68 or '72, don't randomly listen to a '75 AUD and base you decision off that! I tried to listen to Phish, but they don't even come close to the Dead's musical expertise for me. I would rather listen to an old, crusty, reel-to-reel AUD from '70 than hear Junta again! That album SUCKS! If only everyone could understand the Dead, it really is for a select few who have a higher state of musical consciousness.\n\nNow for the real Deadheads out there...THIS SHOW IS GREAT! The sound is a little off but fairly good for an AUD from that era. Crazy Fingers is b-e-a-utiful and this the Help>Slip>Franklin's is amazing. Don't miss out on this rare gem!",

All in all this is a pretty damn good show albeit a bit mellow. Sound quality is very nice. \nNow, re Phish, you bashers need to chill. Phish and GD are diffeerent bands, different music and a different yet similar scene. Yes, the Phish scene is a bit full of trustafarians and posers but there are very many headz that are in it for the right reasons. DO NOT knock the musicianship of Phish. These guys are trained musicians with many years of experience under their belts. They jam hard and well. IMO they are better than GD in aspects but fall short in others. Phish is standing the test of time and have been around for over 20 years and will likely be around for many more. Just as one mentioned earlier, you can't take Junta (or GD's 1975 tour) and generalize that as the end all be all of Phish (or GD). That is absurd. All of us headz know that you cannot generalize from a studio album or even from an era. Yes late 90's Phish was nearly as phantastic as it gets but the 2009 run was a renaissance and many phisheads know it. Of course there are the critics who need to bash others to feel their worth but I was on the 2009 tour for 12 shows and was thoroughly impressed as were the thousands of others that were just happy to be gettin down again. In conclusion, just enjoy the damn music and don't bash other bands simply beacuse some moron thought that the show was too short and thus beneath his favorite band. \nThanks to all of the Taperz out there that made this site possible! I came up too late to catch GD live (have seen the Dead, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, DSO etc but never a true GD show) and this site has made it possible for me to experience true GD. Love the comments, they can give you the feel for the show when you have those that were at the show to give you details about them...love it...",

      "review_text": "to scurrying squirrel: BS?  I think NOT..... I'm the LAST person to ever engage in a debate regarding differences of opinions in music, but the \".....this is B.S.\" comment from \"scurrying squirrel\" got me so fired-up I have to speak out.....\n\n\nI gave Phish a chance in the mid-90s, attending 2 shows and listening to a handful of tapes.  First of all, in my mid-30s at the time, I felt positively OLD at the shows.  Secondly, I admire the Phish kids as musicians, 'cause they're quite talented; heck, they're free to stop by my house if they ever want to learn something about jamming: guitar, fiddle, banjo, bass, drums, keys, I'll play any & all.....bring those Phish youngsters ON.....\n\n\nI WANTED to like them, but I couldn't and NEVER WILL; some of the jams I've heard are excruciating in their length & execution.  Let's face it: they simply DON'T have the SONGS.  Who in the heck wants to listen to a jammed-out POORLY-constructed song with a ho-hum melody?  I sure as heck don't......\n\n\nVirtually any of the WORST of the Dead STEAMROLLS the BEST of Phish.  Period.  This is not simply my opinion.....that's just The Way It Is.  It's all about the quality of playing, melody and SONG.\n\nTrey (that is the guy's name, right?) can't hold a candle to Weir as a guitar player/performer, let alone GARCIA.  Good Lord, who in their right mind would even THINK such nonsense?!?  Again, I say this with all due respect to the little boys in Phish.  They have always aspired to follow in the footsteps of the BIG boys......I admire them for that.....\n\n\nThis show may not be the hottest or longest the Dead ever played, but \"scurrying squirrel\" needs to BURN his or her Phish tape collection and start listening to the Dead on a daily basis.....there's still hope for him or her yet.....\n\n\nBy the way: this tape gets the least airplay around my house of any of the 1975 shows, but it's still a strong, engaging performance.  Turn your attention to the \"Blues For Allah\" suite from Mar23....!!\n\n\nGood show, excellent AUD....3 stars.....",

I was 16 at this show and what an impression it made.\n\nThe light show was incredible. There was so much Window Pane there. Ahhh, I'll never forget the Bob Fried Memorial Boogie. Kieth & Donna, Diga Rhythm Band, Kingfish, Jerry Garcia & Friends. What I will forget is the performance by The Mirrors who opened the show. Tried to sound like Stoneground in feathered leather halter tops and platform shoes. The ladies were friends with Grace Slick, I hear, and she asked Bill G to help them out.\n\nAgain, best light show and one of the best Dead shows ever. But you had to be there to understand.",

      "review_text": "What a bunch of gum flappers Phish! Rawr! Dead! Rawr!\n\nIt seems like people are getting down on Phish because they have a lot of the same fanbase as the Dead and improvise within a rock and roll format.\n\nI mean..really? This is what constitutes \"yearning for a different age\"? Dancing to music with improvisational leanings?\nFinding life on the road punctuated by orgasmic rock concerts to be more interesting than working a 9 to 5?\n\n I can't imagine how sickening you people would seem to a Garcia or a Coltrane who devoted their entire life to the universal joy of music (and heroin)\nIt is really a shame that some people are so hesitant to shake their own nostalgia trips off and live in the present. \n\nThis goes doubly for Phish fans who dealt with all of this \"You think you're having fun but it's never gonna be as good as it USED TO BE\" old man grumbling 20 years ago and now pass it on to people finding their dancing shoes with younger bands.\n\nIt's all relative, I'm sure the real old school Dead Heads might have some sort of fluttering bong soaked memories of calling Kerouac a cranky old man for disdaining THEIR whole scene for not being as pure and as wonderous as the one to come before.\n\nIt's all music. You either move with the times or you don't. Just remember how you used to feel about traditionalist stick-in-the-muds before you became one yourself.\n\nparaphrased: \"The Dead on their worst day were better than Phish on their best\"\n\nWell at least we know that you have absolutely no standards for the only band you ever thought worth your time.\n\nI'll give this show 5 stars because it has a Blues For Allah in it and that song never got enough love.-\n\nUpdataed 5 years later..\n\nThere's so much absurdity here. I couldn't care less if someone hates the Dead or hates Phish. I love both. I also love a lot of other bands instead of listening to every single version of every song the same 2 bands play.\n\nBut some of the BS on here is ridiculous. Phish needs to \"chill with the political and religious stuff\" and they jam for 2 minutes and then start talking? Literally never heard that happen at a Phish show.\n\nPhish drew 1,000 people in Dallas in 1995? Possibly. Doesn't matter either. But they also played Madison Square Garden and the Boston Garden before Jerry died, so to act like they were small potatoes until \"gifted\" a fanbase is stupid. That's the thing about fans of quasi-underground music. They act like the size of your fanbase doesn't matter until they need it to in order to prove that another and is better. \n\nPhish absolutely has a debt to the Dead, but a much bigger one to the Stones, Zeppelin and Progressive Rock. \n\neither way. i feel terrible for people who lived through the 70s and aren't familiar with the tiniest fraction of amazing psychedelic music being made around the world because they were lodged so hard up the Dead's butt.  they're my favorite band, but this idea that the Dead on their worst night was better than anyone on their best? thats like some abused wife cult member shit. jerry would straight slap you for having so little respect for the thousands of amazing musicians out there getting weird and beautiful.",

Unfortunately, I think he relies too much on that harmonic knowledge and doesn't place proper emphasis on the equally crucial element of melody. That is where Garcia has him beat, and why Garcia will always be the better guitarist. That being said, your claims are the worst combination of pompous and erroneous I've seen in a long time.\n\nGo listen to 12-31-93 Stash and tell me Trey lacks harmonic knowledge.

Some of it has been made into classical music, and sounds great both ways. (specifically the song guyute)... Their  flaw is Trey's ego imo. Sometimes he plays too many notes and doesn't allow page and mike the room to breathe. And when the bass and keys are out front, the music is supreme. \n\nWhile Jerry is also out front all the time, it is never ego driven. Jerry & GD's music is all SOUL. be it in a long jam or 5 minute round & round. Phish has soul, but it is not as pronounced in their music, and I feel it truly comes out during the soft, spacey ambient moments, slave to the traffic light for example...",

This is very fun show and the whole band really brings the heat for these set of Demo Shows.\n\nThere are several transition Dead periods and this one created so much excitement and the promise of a thrilling adventure.  I remember the summer BFA came out \u2013it was everywhere and the blessed few who were able to score their very own personal copy of \u201cMake Believe Ballroom \u2013 the 1975 Spot Check\u201d, ( produced on the fabulous Amazing Korny Fone Record Label, [and who in turn made countless tapes of the vinyl decades before OFTV was released] ), played it till the groves wore out.\n\nSo the opportunity to capture as many of these moments is a gift or wondrous import and I am appropriately Grateful.\n\nAnd so to Phishy Things.\n\nFolks began whispering things to me about this Phish band around \u201996.  \u201cDude! You gotta check these cats out! You\u2019ll love em!  They\u2019re just like the Dead!\u201d.  I\u2019ll state here that Phish-heads embraced this praise the way most folks embrace raw sewage in their cereal bowl.  More on that in a bit.\n\nWe finally went to see Phish at MSG 12-29-98 and 12-30-98.  The bro I went with and I were stoked to finally see this band and I\u2019d acquired several CD\u2019s and we both felt prepared.  We weren\u2019t.  The shows we saw were so jaw-droppingly good and the jams so fierce and epic and the discipline these guys have and the quality of both their skill and their feel were a revelation.  And the shows were fun!  These guys PLAY on stage.  They goof around, ( like the Dead did frequently ).\n\nSomewhere way back on Andy Gadiel\u2019s old site there was a quote that goes a bit like this: \u201cThe Dead would take you gently by the hand and lead on a wondering journey through mountains and clear springs.  Phish is like a locomotive barrelling down the track and you better keep up or get out of the way\u201d.  That\u2019s not exactly spot on but it\u2019s close.\n\nI\u2019ve spent many, many years playing the Dead\u2019s music and getting inside Jerry\u2019s head to learn how he did what he did.  To do that I had to learn blues, bluegrass, jazz, and a bunch of other stuff \u2013 just to get started.  Along the way I also developed an passionate love for the music of Frank Zappa.  Right here and now \u2013 if you  don\u2019t like FZ \u2013 you will not like Phish.  \n\nI get what Phish does and it took a bit.  Phish does in the space of 20 seconds what the Dead often took ten minutes to do.  The Dead are nearly an intuitive taste.  Phish is not quite that accessible.  \n\nThe major quibbles I have with Phish are the same that I have with Umphrey\u2019s, moe. and a few other notable jam bands.  If I could say one thing to all these bands: Hire A Frigging Lyricist!  You wanna know why most of these bands \u2013 talented, impeccably capable of monster jams and great shows \u2013 do not turn the corner into the majors?  Few people really take the time to remember pseudo karmic bong hit hippie lyrics rife with arcane inside jokes or codes.  \n\nNot every band if blessed to have Robert Hunter or John Barlow for lyricists, ( there\u2019s a rumour moe. has begun working with Hunter ).  One reason the Dead ARE \u201cThe Dead\u201d is because the SONGS are so wonderful.  Ripple?  Uncle Johns?  Eyes?  Attics?  Sugar Mag?  Weather Report: Suite?  Jack Straw?  Help-Slip-Frank?  To name but a very few?  \n\nThere are SONGS that the band developed played and developed into jam pieces AFTER they were first SONGS.  I love Phish, I really do.  Anyone who thinks Reba, Lizards, David Bowie, Mango Song, YEM are anything but epic works of rock music doesn\u2019t get it.  That said, my daughter, who loves Phish, maybe said it best: \u201cDad, \u2018Divided Sky\u2019 isn\u2019t a song \u2013 it\u2019s six words, repeated once, with a twenty-five minute jam.  Great jam. But not a song\u201d.  She had me.\n\nPhish arrived at a time a space where the folks who got them were much more into the jams than the actual song-worthiness of their songs.  They have some very good songs.  Song-wise, \u201cRift\u201d in probably their strongest effort.  Tom Marshall, ( the Phish LYRICIST ),  is reported to have written most of the lyrics while going through a very painful divorce.  The pain, the soul, the tension of the search for resolution, all come out in the strongest set of songs Phish has offered to date.  My two cents \u2013 get him back in the game.\n\nFor me personally the biggest difference is the scene.  Phish shows I\u2019ve been to are NOT a kind scene.  I was not made to feel welcome there and the open animosity for Dead Heads \u201cinvading\u201d Phish shows was a bit of a shock.  Very much an \u201cOur Band \u2013 Get Lost!\u201d attitude.  THAT vibe does exist in stark and sad contrast to the warm and welcoming scene at Dead show I went to.  We long considered it almost a duty to bring a newbie along for the ride \u2013 to share what was to us a spiritual journey of music and community.  That sense of welcome and community could be embraced by the Phisher Polk and no harm would be done.\n\nBut for anyone to suggest that Phish doesn\u2019t jam, they either don\u2019t get it or need some schooling themselves.",

You talk about peace n love and come on here and trash people sounds a bit hyprocritical to me.   Trey is a hell of a guitar player and he most certainly has his own sound.  I love the GD but the jams Phish has thrown down throughout the years are just better.  Lyrically sure the GD is better.  But Phish takes me to THAT place more often than the Dead.  Overall I love the Jerry and I love Trey but if i had to pick id go with Trey.  So go ahead and hate on this all you like while I go enjoy some great music.",

I love both bands!  i also love miles davis, bach, the beach boys and the supremes.  there is a lot of music i dont like, but still understand that it is 'good music'- i am a 'dead head' at heart and i play them more than any other band- but i realize that just because i dont like something, it doesnt mean it 'sucks'-\nTrey makes a very good point in the movie 'Bittersweet Motel' when someone compares him to Jerry- he says (paraphrase) he loved Jerry, but he isnt Jerry- isnt trying to be him.  people, in general are always looking for a convenient comparison-  it just isnt that simple.\ncrowd:  yes, the phish crowd sucks- but as i recall, so did the GD crowd, at times.  i remember selling the next night's Deer Creek tickets at the campground following a show due to disbelief and disgrace from that nights events (gate crashers and such)- i was done and walking away- the scene had collapsed and i wanted nothing to do with it.  but there are also good souls at the phish shows- i can attest for that. and while the phish of today may not be what we were getting in the mid 90s, it is still so much better than 99% of the music that is out there today.  if you dont like em- dont go see them, but stop all the rediculousness about 'they suck'.  just my 3 cents....\n\"aint no time to hate\"\nsw",

Every instrument and voice is crisp in the mix, w/ just enough audience and arena-reverb magic.

Just a couple of seconds, but emblematic of so much to these ears. Smack dab between '74 and the later 70s sound of this band. Uncle Sam is hiding out, folks. Big River and the US Blues rock AND roll it right out of the park. Weir and Donna blending so tastefully - gosh, musta been FRESH to hear this band going new places like this in 1975.        \n\nOne from the Vault was recorded 2 months later(Aug 13), and of course released on compact disc in '91.",

In a year almost void of Dead shows this is a small snippet of their ever changing style.  A perfect Charlie Miller Remastered Sound Board could not make this better.  Usually I am Sound Board fan.  But this captures something else.  2nd Solo is my fav.  \n\nCrazy Fingers sounds great with the echo of the audience recording.\n\nBIODTL is one of my favorite versions of all time.  The Bass Beats comment before the song.  Best ending of any BIODTL solo ever in my opinion.  That screeching end note.  And god damn Jerry's rhythm afterwards  with the piano is awesome.  Keith is superb.\n\nPeggio is amazing.  I have Two things in my Will.  Who my Cat will go to.  And to play this Version of Peggio at my funeral.  \n\nFranklin's Tower:  My Number One and Two are both 75.  This and 9-28-75.  Both have amazing smooth intros.  This one I consider slightly smoother.   For 9-28 listen to the Menke Aud.  Again awesome super smooth but with drums and bass higher in the mix you can feel that back beat groove much harder.  \n\nI grew up in Burlington, Vermont.  Phish's hometown.  Me and all my friends listened to their albums growing up, not so much live stuff.  Phish has some absolutely great stuff.  Nobody can't deny.  \n\nListen to Hoist and try and tell me most of that is not some great music.  Sample In A Jar is my favorite Phish Song Of Time. \n\nTheir least weird album, mostly great rock songs.  Lyrics are actually less weird than Dark Star, Eleven, China Cat.  \n\nFav Live Jam/Song I've Seen:\nRun Like An Antelope\n2001 Theme\nMike's Song\n\nFav Covers I've Seen:\nPeaches en Regalia\nLife On Mars\n50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\n\nThey do fucking Freebird Acapella.  Come on even it is not the greatest holy fuck the balls on these stoned slackers!  Personally reminds of the Vocal Jam on He's Gone from 3-28-73 every time I listen.  Here is a couple versions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ8hMho40Qg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_XI7hm7ygk\n\nChicago 98 Freebird is the Best.  From knocking the mics so all 4 have to hold on at one point.  To actually seeming go into a Acapella Psychedelic Jam at one point where you think they are not on point at all and come back.  The ending.  To Phishman, the drummer who wears a dress, coming back to say goodbye or something and either says gibberish or gets cut off immediately.",

This show is brilliant. \n\nNot only for its first ever live debut performances of Crazy Fingers (and as an opener, you can only imagine how proud of that tune the boys were, and rightly so) and also not to mention the DEBUT of the Holy GD Tryptic of Help/Slip/Frank (Help On The Way being lyricless still at this stage, still being birthed into the American Beauty of a song that it would become). Great songs and performances all around from BIODTL, Deal to Big River and Peggy O too even Sugar and US Blues. Speaking of which, Allah sings his Blues this show, we got one of the very few love performances of Blues For Allah (without lyrics too, just as everything else from that ultimate album would become, but at this time it was a period of great growth and change and explorations crearively and otherwise! \n\nBut still, THIS is the first Crazy Fingers AND the first Help on the Way, you can see even hearing it now what is yet to come, the infinite, and then theres that 9min Slipknot! And that enlightening first ever Franklin\u2019s Tower is absolutely incredible, I love hearing the audience totally jive with this entirely new music being perofmend for them by a band they/we all love dearly. Truly history-making for those keeping track. And this 72-78 era is my favorite of their tunes and creative output, I love also the stuff before and after, but between that bracket of time is This here Grateful Dead 1975 sweet spot. \n\nThese are my favorite songs of theirs if I\u2019m being honest. This whole period is like my sweet spot for the band. Great show all around. I would have loved to hit any of those \u201875 shows had I been born (\u201885 guy here, I was born on the day they played the Oklahoma City Zoo Amphitheater in Sept, really decent show for 1985 in fact!). \n\nMuch love to you all, let\u2019s be vehicles for forward movement and progress oriented change in this crazy world. Be a love light that turns others\u2019 on, turn on your love lights, let \u2018em shine on me!\n\nNFA (~);} 2404",

The music of 1975 was some of their most adventurous musically, with the track \"Blues for Allah\" being something completely different. Too bad it had a short run but I can see why it did. \nAll you have to do is go from the rehearsals and shows of 1975, with the new material from BfA to 1976, where they did a complete 180 musically. I compare it to the change from the hardcore psychedelic GD of 1968/69 transitioning into the Americana band of 1970 up to 1974. Either way, it's all good music and it's great to have access to them. Sound quality is pretty good too; the highlights for me would be all the material from Blues for Allah, esp. the instrumental \"Help/Slipknot\", very cool. \"The Peggy-O\" is nice and chill too. Everything else is good\n\nPhish and the GD are two completely different bands but we all know that Phish and the phish heads would not exist - nor would any other \"jam\" band for that matter - without the Dead, their approach to live music and of course, the Deadheads.",
