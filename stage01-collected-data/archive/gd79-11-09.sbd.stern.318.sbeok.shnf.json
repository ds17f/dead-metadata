Goode, is from the (previous night, sounds good).  The first set is upbeat and rippin', with Jerry shredding the LL>Supplication jam.  Phil \"on\" and pumpin' away all show long.  A unique Easy To Love You, with alternate lyrics I think. Dancin' is upbeat and bubbly, with great Brent/Jerry jamming.  The killer for me is the sick jam out of Estimated, with Jerry's pre-midi horn sounding guitar, some sick sounds and beautiful tones.  He's Gone has great vocals and then leads into another sick jam, Phil dropping some phat notes, almost into a Caution jam, but then into a Gloria jam.  Not as full-blown as the one from the Stanley a few weeks later, but there.  Great sounding drums follow.  Sweet show.  The static is very low-level and does not distract.",

I was trippin hard too & remember sitting up high watchin & thinking wow this is the best thing to happen to me ever. I had gotten a few live tapes from some veteran deadhead friends & they convinced me to go. Brent was the new guy & when He sang Easy To Love You, I really felt like that also. He sang different verses that night & I've loved Brent's voice, playing & songs ever since. Dancin Franklins was hot & for some reason I rememeber the drums being something very prehistoric to me at the time. The Gloria Jam after he's gone was a taste of things to come. I am so glad to have this soundboard finally. I had an OK audience copy since the show that never quite did it. Relistening to this on SB brings it all back. One of last few Miracle Bertha Good Lovins too.",

For it being a highly circulated analog, it seems rather underrated, but to have it now online at great sound quality is a treat. The first set is very tight, a newly played Althea is very loose, ending with a gigantic Jack Straw. The Dancin features terrific jamming with an interesting segway into Franklin's (thanks to Phil). The jam out of He's Gone is the Gloria jam they did a fews times, here it being very intense. All in all, a must have.",

Ah Brent, we hardly knew ye.\nP.S.  Check out, maybe, it's 10:47 on Franklin's, sorry, that was at least one wine ago, where Garcia decides to trill the heck out of the thing, and then Weir steps up with a 40 ounce bat and trounces Garcia with his own Paul Bunyan-sized trilling.  \n\nThese guys were achieving some serious mastery at this point in their professional lives.

Brent shines throughout, Jerry is on point, the drums is vintage and there is some sweet jamming, the likes of which I have not heard elsewhere. \n\nIn particular the He's Gone jam is super notable. Brent is on board with some synth action (Prophet 5, Moog), a totally new direction for the Dead, and you can tell in that jam that it was just the spice, among others, the band needed at the time to remotivate and move on into the eighties.\n\nI give this one a 5 for playing, mostly set 2, and a 4 for sound - right channel is a little scrunchy at times but nothing major.",

As an AUD hound, I'm always looking for a minimum of vocal \"disharmony\", so I can enjoy the music.  Too many SBDs have the vocals wayy too high, and it drives me crazy.  Or the sound is sterile and lifeless.  But I am pleasantly surprised by THIS SBD.  Except for the slight bit of fuzz here and there, it's warm and inviting.  Jerry doesn't sound too bad and Bob doesn't sound like he's screaming or spitting in the mike.  The transition into Franklin's is fabulous.  The Gloria is good, but I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers and say that the Stanley Gloria is better.  Ol' Jer seemed just a touch tentative.  To me, it's clear that the 1st was \"all out\".  The trans into WR from drumz is very nice.  But the end of the second is down right flamin'.  No China Doll, Stella, R&R, or OMSN to spoil things.

      "review_text": "Delicious Show If I could give this somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars I would.  I guess I just did.  Ok...this is a fun, great, fun show.  Brent just lights things up on the edges and brings things back to life.  THis show is - as is the entire fall of '79 - a great example of that idea / opinion.  Candy!  Although..I must say, IMHO, the \"dancin' > franklin's\" is, I dare say, overrated.  Don't get me wrong, I was dancin' like a maniac to the \"dancin\" but the meat of the song - the jam in the middle - is a little meandering and falls victim to what made other songs in this show so wonderful, namely Jerry's precision attack of singular notes, one after the other, composing a \"sheet of sound\".  Dancin' needs some air and room to breathe...and when that's done ala 5/8/77, it's wonderful.  The \"transition\" here is more like a very, very smooth handoff, but not such a huge transition that most divulge.  It's a nice handoff - exciting and fun and surprising - but none the less, its a nice handoff and not a huge \"transition\" piece.  The Franklin's rocks.  Jerry's precision attack is right on point and at home and a \"fit\" for this song.  Althea, Easy to Love You, Cassidy, Lazy Lightnin'-supplication, and They Love Each Other in this Fall '79 period are treats, treats, TREATS.  Enjoy this show.  It's the candy!",

      "review_text": "A tight show One of my favorite 1979 shows. It has some great performances and a great set list, with clean vocals and tight playing. Check out the recently revived They Love Each Other and the blazing Cassidy, which is a highlight of the first set.\n\nThe second set has some strong work, with a pleasing sequence of continuous songs. The Dancing is nothing special, but Jerry does some nice work on Franklin's Tower. A mellow He's Gone is followed by a jam that speeds up to a Caution Do Not Step on the Tracks jam, which then turns into a jam based on the Gloria riff. This devolves into Drums. There's an interesting transition from Drums into an extended atmospheric Space jam, which finally resolves into a strong Wharf Rat. Jerry smokes on Bertha.",

If anyone has been paying attention, nine (9) of the songs from the Buffalo Auditorium show from 11/9 are on this \u201cRoad Trips\u201d 3-CD set (includes bonus disk).

      "review_text": "What a show! So fluid, so awesome, specially if you like the good Brent stuff. Everything just seems on. For some reason its overshadowed by the Cape Cod run, which was baller, but this seems like a more advanced version of that. First set is solid but second is why it super special.\n\nI didn't discover these few Brent era Disco Dancin's until fairly recently and I have to say its way good. This version in particular is so straight forward. Everybody is having a great time and jamming fluidly. No lazy weak links tonite! Bobby is as audible as Jerry (a rarity) and you really get a nice sense of what allot of these boards are missing out on. Healy loved turning Bobby down and turning Jerry way up, which  works enough, but its his guitar work that makes this show stick out, no Jers, which is certainly inspired, but Bobby and Brent really bring this show vocally together. \n\nDancin'>Franklins is seamless in transition, no stop then go, just a \"whoa, there playing franklins now!!\", Then a solid Estimated. The He's Gone is incredibly lovely with some amazing vocalizations and playing from all of the boys. They take there time with the jam out which has some of the absolute best jamming from this period followed by some Caution teases then a full out Gloria Jam. Drums and Space is pleasant and well played. The east coast really brings out the best in all of them. Wharf Rat has Jer giving his vocal all with some specially soulful drawls. Miracle is silly and aggressive, in other words its great. Bertha>Good Lovin' is standard but fun. Go 79', this is when the band really started to realize that Keith and Donna were holding them back.",

Here in 79 Brent is the one supercharging the jams.\nMust have been a blast to catch this tour.\nI know in 89/90 I couldn't wait for the next show.\n-----\nI am wondering if Lightning>Supplication got dropped for similar reasons to Money, Money. \nlove the groove on Lazy Lightning.\nand just don't see a musical reason \nnot to play this tune?\nCould it be the lyrics are too aggressive?    \nI find this tune so much better with Donna Jean,\nit seemed to capture underlying chemistry. \nThe initial versions in 76 when Donna hit those rolling ocean wave sounds were some of my favorite GD jam material with her.\n(more subtle than SCARLET and not so over the top as G-SET and P.I.T.B )\nAnyway not to make this a Donna thing.\n--------\nThe GO To Heaven tunes here are very cool.\nPretty sweet to hear them working thru.\nAlthea seems to have a way more lethargic pace here in 79.\nbecause to me Althea picked up the pace of a set when played in the 80's /90s\nAlmost like the opposite of the way FOTD went from Mandolin fueled in 1970 to  Quaalude coma in the late 70's.\nBrent really has a nice voice. It seemed like most of his tunes were not always easy to jam into and out of. Perhaps Blow Away and Just  A Little Light were the start of more opened ended song writing by him but that is water under the bridge.  \nJack Straw excels as a 1st set closer!\n\nDancin' sounds great as an opener either set.\nI like how Brent gives a nod to it being November in Buffalo by subtly adjusting the tense of the lyrics.\nLots of Phil helping to percolate this funk heavy\npost disco era DITS. \nAnd Brent is just blowing my mind. \nOur nickname for Mydland was The SLASHER!\nThe transition Dancin>Franklin's is perfect with no meandering or excessive countoff delay.\nMuch versatility with FRANKLIN'S  I know everybody would jones for H>S.F especially when it was not in the rotation but wow could Franklin's connect to a variety of open ended tunes in the Dead's repertoire\nESTIMATED>He's Gone\nNot sure I was ever pulling for anything but EYES after Estimated Prophet but the harmonies during this tune would always make me forget whatever minor perceived loss I had suffered by Not getting EYES after every single Estimated. (of course when they switched to Eyes>Estimated then I really didn't give a flip if they played Estimated or not.)\nNice middle passage jam on this Estimated.\nAnd PROPHET was great for that megalomania feeling like I could stand right next to a mountain and chop it down with the edge of my hand.\npre-jam before drumz is TOP SHELF!\nWharf Rat out of Space as last ballad \nis the clue\nthey are going to pound it to the finish line\nMiracle>Bertha.Good Lovin'\nThey are moving at lightning speed",
