It's hard to argue that 4/20 setlist or the performance.  This was back when 4/20 didn't mean anything to anybody.\n\nBut of the 500+ shows I have on tape/DAT/CD, I think I've listened to this one the most.  I don't know why I love this show so much, I just do.  The beginning of the Help is unorganized with the band all coming in at different times.  I personally love the way it begins, but some would prolly call it \"botched\" and who could blame them.  I love the Help > Slip >Franklins from this show.  The Playin is where this show really shines.  It's definitely my favorite Playin and parts of it get \"out there\".  It's great!  The China Doll is awesome too as is the transition into CD.  Then you get a free tune after the China Doll!\n\nI love the Space jam and IMHO, this is the best Wharf Rat ever played.  Wharf Rat is one of my least favorites, but this version is one I can listen to over and over.  Jerry's vocals and playing are just ON.  Remainder of the show is standard fare.  \n\nThe Help, Slip, Franklins, Playin, Space>Wharf Rat make this show a must.",

      "review_text": "An important chapter in the evolution of the 83-84 comeback of the Help->Slipknot->. Listening to this turned up loud on some decent Sony headphones I am moved to write a review!\nThis one is consistently mentioned when there is discussion of the best quality audience recordings.  Don't know all of the technical details but do know that the mics were spread 30 feet apart in the 17th row and that they fed into an early generation digital deck.  I think this comes as close to puting you \"in the civic center\" as I have heard from any recording.\nThe first set heats up as it gains momentum.  West LA Fade is slick and professional with a dark side to it.  The closing Looks Like Rain->Deal has the band taking exciting risks and exploring.\n In set II we get to hear each band member return to the stage.  Out of the random notes of the band's tuneup rises  a steady beat.  Brent takes it up, then Phil.  Then you hear the taper call it!  \"Help on the Way!  Help on the way!\"  What a great moment.  The Help is much slower and very groovy.  Slipknot is an underwater snake weaving throught the muddy Amazon!  This is serious stuff.  I must concur with the other reviewers.  Franklin's is super loose and bouncy, Jerry's at the wheel.  A very spacy Playing follows.  Jerry's voice is shot on the chorus of China Doll but he still pulls it off with great heart and effect.\nContrary to what a lot of people think about 84 as a year, the spring east coast tour was exceptional.  I caught the show two nights later in Providence.  Jerry looked awful and was probably very high for the vast majority of the shows.  The band sounded loud and aggressive and played with recklessness on many nights.  This night at the Philly Civic Center is a great snapshot of the band.  Put yourself in the correct state of mind, pop on the headphones and crank up the second set.  You won't be dissapointed.",

Crank it up and you ARE IN that echoey hall, feeling every one of Phil's bass bombs.  All of the elements of the band are in perfect balance except for Jerry's guitar which is a little low in the mix.  The show is note-perfect classic GD with none of the sloppiness of some of the 1984 shows.",

Anyway that's a big reason why this sounds the way it does. The recording captures just enough of the echo in this old Philly Hall and I think the Boys were stoked to play this broke down palace.\n\n*****nice pull, sonic bass with beautiful separation.",

      "review_text": "Top Ten for 1984 So what's better than enjoying 420?\nWhy, 421 of course !!\nSome of you might think I've lost my mind completely. Not only am I bothering to rate shows from 1984, now I'm even picking AUD recordings!???\n\nHowever, as many of the reviews from this run of shows will attest, there are some INCREDIBLE sounding AUD tapes from this period. These guys had the right stuff, and the right location. We owe them a big debt, cause otherwise this show would be gone forever.\nSure, I'm praying that a Miller SBD upgrade drops from the clouds, as did 4/20/84. But for now, this AUD will do me just fine. A little echo-ey. But much of that is from the hall's acoustics. Tweak your knobs for some bass and fire up some cheerios.\n\nFour reasons I like this show better than 4/20 - \n1. Bobby does not play Rooster.\n2. They do not encore with Day Job. Brokedown instead !!!\n3. A more solid setlist overall, esp. Set Two.\n4. The Wharf Rat is one of the best from this period.\n\n\nThe first set is tight and well played. FOTD delivers the vibe and sets the mood. West L.A. is also very solid with good vocals by Jerry. I always wished Jerry could have played this song with Little Feat - he and Lowell trading vocals. Can't you see it? But I digress.\nMinglewood is scorching. Bobby is convincing, and the crowd responds. Plenty of funky gospel organ from Brent. By now my head is swirling like the Leslies - and I've completely forgotten that I'm NOT hearing a SBD recording. AMAZING. Even Bobby's slide solo is, well .... good. Phil drops some fat ones, and Jerry solos with passion. The band is really locked in now, and they proceed to lay down an energetic, funky Tenn Jed - one of only 10 played in 1984. Jerry's voice is just raspy enough here, and on this AUD, the 2 drummers don't dominate the mix. You hear plenty of Jerry and Brent, and an above average Phil presence. Again - it's easy to forget you're listening to an AUD recording. Finally, it's Deal that makes the first set worth the trip. Up tempo and blazing from start to finish. Jerry is way out in front on the solo, nails every note and never seems to run out of fire. I'm certain this song sent the audience into the break with melted faces.\nAs I've written before, there seems to be certain songs that shine a little brighter in certain years, for whatever reason. And in 1984, although an uneven year overall - Wharf Rat, Morning Dew, Shakedown and Help>Slipknot are regular standouts for me throughout the year.\nThey dive into Help like they mean business, a lively tempo with Garcia articulating all the riffs perfectly. And Phil, wow. Some monster bass lines that when combined with the counterpoint blazing from Jerry and Brent makes the whole thing sound like Return to Forever. This has to be about the best Help of the year hands down. All 64 colors and then some.\nThen they drop right in to the pocket with Franklin's. The groove is so infectious and comes through so well on the AUD, you can really feel the crowd dancing with you. Jerry and Brent trade synchopated  rhythms like clockwork. This whole trilogy takes over 27 minutes, and if your Dew isn't rolled away by now, check your pulse. Nothing left to do but blast off into Inner Space with a fine Playin. A decent length for the 80's (11 minutes) which includes a very mellow minor mode section from Jerry. Transcendent. Takes me back to those 1973 Dark Star jams. Forget 1984. Forget space and time entirely. This is the Zone.\n\nThe Zone melts and morphs into China Doll so effortlessly you don't notice. Jerry's guitar is really clear and strong here, once again you'd bet your buds it's a SBD. Okay, so he cracks a couple of vocals, but still a solid version with a prize inside - a nice Playin type jam at the end. It seems Jerry just didn't want to stop.\n\nSpace is just right. Not the overly-digital sound of the later 80's. Not boring. Not too hard-edged.\nBut definitely weird. Jerry plays around with the \"Other One\" rhythm a few times but the band won't play. He does manage to coax them into a major key eventually, which leads to a great, heart-stopping version of Wharf Rat. The crowd's response really comes through here, without detracting from the sound. Plenty of bass from Phil and Brent's pedals.\n\"I'll get up and fly away\" - yes you will when you crank this one up. Roses will be growing out of the top of your head. Garcia's leads are shimmering and soaring. And he puts some extra soul into the vocals as well.\nThe band still has plenty of fuel left to throw down a Not Fade Away with teeth. Except for Don't Need Love and Stones, the second set could have been a 1977 show, you dig? \nBrokedown is the star on top of this Christmas tree. A perfect ending to a stellar show and a real highlight for this tour with another good vocal performance from Jerry (and good harmonies from the band).\nA very satisfying show on many levels. 4/20 may also make my top ten, I haven't decided yet. The Scarlet>Fire is very strong. Another listen is in order. But this last night is an undeniable standout.\n\nenjoy the eighties greaties,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "Playing in the Band Playing in the Band (PITB) first appears on Weir's debut solo album spelled with the \"g\" on Playing -- not Playin'. Not sure how the \"g\" got dropped but I am officially appealing for it's return. As an interesting diversion, I have listened to each Playing in the Band beginning with 1980 all the way up to this night. This is my first review since starting. For those who are interested, so far, year-wise, 1980 is the standout with each night consistently delivering very hypnotic, tight psychedelic jams. Overall the song is an interesting microcosm of how the band evolved during what is my favorite period of their 30 year history. I may write up a longer piece on this study because PITB is such an wonderful snapshot of the exploratory, improvisational side of the band's playing. Off the top of my head, 4-17-83, 8-19-80, 10-16-81 are my favorites. \n\nThe sound on this recording is superb. This version of PITB is very tight. '83 marked the beginning of Brent moving away from strictly using the Hammond B-3 organ for this number and switching to the his new Yamaha GS-1 which had the killer marimba tone and other percussive instrument sounds.",

We missed the first song ... but ended up seeing the whole GA show from about 20 feet in front to stage center. Not as good as the Dead ... but a great show either way.",
