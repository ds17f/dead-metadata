Well we all dosed on empty stomachs dehydrated with really really strong acid (took about 3 hits of blotter - when 1 would havebeen more than enough)and had I been able to make it to the first aid tent I would have gone - Even a direct hit from about 10' from a firehose they were using to cool the crowd did not even put a dent in this - For most of this show I sat crumpled against a wall on the floor and could not even speak... it was not fun at all. All of that said on hearing this again there are some nice parts to this and I thought the following week at Giants Stadium was better - this was long and hot.  Even though this story sucks everyone has been there - I still remember feeling like hal9000 in 2001 when his brain is getting disconnected and he is losing all cognitive functions....",

      "review_text": "Ticket Miracle in Foxboro Classic Dead story for this show...my car overheated on the way into Foxboro, after going 2 mph in a 2 hour traffic nightmare. Finally reached the parking lot to let my car cool down and started swilling canned beers.  Girlfriend and I drank a few and then headed up to the show. Threw a few in my backpack for the 'long' walk. Got to the gate and there was a giant sign warning against bringing alcohol into the venue. In my haste to get in, I forgot my beer in my bag. \"No show for you\" was the gatekeepers response. Aghhhhhh.  My girlfriend, who was not a Deadhead and couldn't care less, was already inside. I, ticketless, was outside with no prayer. Walked about 500 yards down a chain link fence and she passed her stub through.  I made up some feeble story about having to go to my car for diapers and it worked.  Anyway, got into the show and stubbed my way onto the 150 degree field for the show.  Music was 'so-so' and the day was as close to going to 'hell in a bucket' as I can remember.  Brent rocked, but that's about all I can say for this show!",

I was on the first leg of the summer tour and the 5 shows that preceded this were slices of heaven, and then this was a descent into hell. First - a zillion people including many yahoos at an oversold stadium show. It was so crowded getting in the ticket takers were overwhelmed. I walked right in. Then, jeez, could this setlist be any lamer?? All I remember is everything sounded super tame and safe. You can skip this one and go for the many other great shows from 87.This aint one!!",

Partying commences when we realize the boys and Dylan are at the same Tara hotel! Will Jer join us?  I say hello to Brent the next morning as he gets into his limo. Traffic getting there sucked, stopped for miles. Dylan flew in on a helicopter. It's hot as hell and Dylan is in all leather! The boys seemed a little sluggish but all in all, but I LOVED the Dylan w/ the dead.  Jerry was all smiles as he played the pedal steel.  \nBill",

      "review_text": "Not really worth anyone's time... Huge inaugural Dead/Dylan Boston show; I'm sure the expectations were high to perform a gig we'll be discussing for years...\n\n1st Set: A sagging \"Touch\" opens. Bobby is hilarious as he cheesily over enunciates the chorus. \"We're going to take a minute here while the roadies nail Billy's other foot down.\" Things get taken up a notch with a blistering \"Hell.\" A standard \"West\" makes it three new tracks in a row. I'm sure the crowd is beginning to catch on as the first four songs are sequentially accurate to the listing on 'In the Dark.' \"Tons\" is fine, although the unfortunate sound is cirrus cloudy and distant. What,?! no 'Push,' or 'Esau?' It's probably because they're too ball less to play 'Throwing' in the first set. Anyways, \"Rooster\" is ok; the band seemingly does Not want to follow the sloppy leadership of Brent's. Jerry's seemingly interested in instrument playing only. \"Althea\" is the right skeptical tone for this uncertain show. \"Box\" is standard.\nAs there is no set break, we jump right into a finely played but bland, unexciting \"Uncle.\" This segues into a your run of the mill \"Playing\" song that only becomes of interest when they embrace the outro jam, and watch it float to \"Drums/Space.\" The latter, tonight is particularly enjoyable. Keen timing on the segue even if there's no power behind it. The versions of \"Truckin\" and \"TOO\" are professional, but a little too by the book although there are plenty of synth sonic sounds to provide a pleasant experience. \"Throwing\" is nice... but this show is a lost cause.",

So the gate-crashing jerk-offs behind yourself got beat up by the cops? I don't approve of police brutality but crash the gates & you get what you deserve!!!! gate crashers suck. And by the way I have met Bill Walton @ many shows & found him to be a great guy, down to earth & easy to talk to. Hey bill thanks for the autograph on my SYF hat. Maybe next time this jerkoff feels like gate-crashing he should stick to metallica. Any show where gate crashers are caught & tossed deserves 5 stars in my book.",

sure how they felt about music in their arena.\n\nAnd the Dead, I had taken to seeing them less often, because the shows were becoming mundane.\n\nThe stage was setup at one end of the stadium with Portapots at the 50-yard line and the field was covered in an attempt to prevent abuse to the field.\n\nPeople were jumping barriers everywhere to get on the field which is where we ended up, but I think that was because those were our tickets.\n\nThe Dead opened with four songs from their new album; all but one had been in their rotation for years.  The new one Tons of Steel by Brent was actually pretty good, especially when compared to Easy to Love You or Far from Me.\n\nThis was followed by Little Red Rooster, not my favorite, but Brent again livened it up with his vocals.\n\nBox of Rain had always been a favorite for me but this was the third show in a row I had heard it, none the less it was great to hear Phil sing ONE song.\n\nAfter Althea they went into a second set treatment of Playing, Uncle John, Truckin, Wharf Rat and finished with Throwing Stones, this set arrangement confused a lot of people but it was nice to hear a longer first set.\n\nA helicopter buzzed the fans and many people claimed they say Dylan in it, but I don\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t see how that was possible.\n\nDylan appeared on stage and appeared to stagger,  leaving many in our group to suggest he showed up drunk.

believe I heard him play it for a number of years after that.\n\nThe rest of the set was what we had come for the Dead trying out old Dylan tunes and Dylan being Dylan.\n\nWe had a great time, but when the show was over we looked at the Portapots on the field and noticed that most of them were crushed, apparently from people trying to stand on top of them.  The field also appeared to be torn up and we assumed that that would be the last time the Dead would play Foxboro.  The next day in the paper the Stadium officials were quite gleeful about the show claiming they had never had such a profitable event.\n\nIn the years that followed the Dead shows in the Boston area became next to impossible to get tickets for, while Dylan started his Never Ending Tour, this show was really a turning point in many ways.",

The heads were pissed - everyone thought there would be three sets, but when the Dead went into the Drums/Space section, people began to bristle.  NO ONE was happy with that arrangement - and the Dead knew it, because by the next time I saw this tour at Giants Stadium, they were playing three sets.  And at that point, I never wanted to hear \"West LA, \"Tons of Steel,\" \"Push\" or \"Bucket\" EVER again.  I wasn't exactly thrilled.  Fortunately, I had just come the Toronto and Rochester shows, so I blew it off as a mistake by the band in only playing one crappy set.  The Dylan section was better and I enjoyed it more.  Nightmare in the parking lot though - dodging fireworks like I was on a battlefield just trying to get out of there that evening.  \n\nJboy - shut the fuck up already.",

We don't need any light in the loafers Donna G. lovers anyway.....certainly hope you have contracted a social disease by now! The funny part is that you...YOU.. have the temerity to judge a person (and a whole city) based on one ironically-spun tale. You know nothing about me or Boston and you are such a self-righteous, judgmental little pu$$y, I'm sure you were bullied (deservedly so) all throughput your pathetic little life. Grow a pair of gonads.\n\nBTW Chuck M. - As always, 9 years later you are still welcome to lick my balls. I take it you are one of the many lapdogs who jizz their jeans over every fart the Dead ever amplified. \n\nLighten up M.L.K.! - maybe someday\nwe can all be as righteous as you. \n\nWeird show.  Was hot as balls that day and we had no tickets.  Rode down with two friends in some guy's car who I had never met until that day.  We saw Bill Walton of Celtics fame behind this chain-link fence at some backstage party.  He was tapping a beer out of a keg about 10 feet from the fence and was talking to people in the crowd and answering their questions like \"Hey Bill how's the knee doing?\" \"Will you be back w/ the Celts next year?\" etc.  Finally, my friend asked \"Hey Bill, can we have a beer?\" He got this disgusted look on his face and walked away shaking his head.  What a dick!\n\nAnyway, me and the guy who asked Walton for a beer and a third guy wound up burrowing under a chain-link fence to get into the show.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys behind us they got caught by some Foxboro cops who beat the bejeezus out them with billy-clubs. Well, better them than us.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the guy who was our ride apparently never got into to the show and took off in his car. He took off with my favorite shirt and my friend's favorite frisbee or some shit.  We were so confused after the show we tried to hitch-hike back to Boston but went the wrong way out the gate and wound up in Providence, Rhode Island. We vowed to beat the shit out the guy who abandoned us but we never saw him again.  Dude if you're out there, F*ck You and give me my shirt back.\n\nOh, the show - I don't really remember if it was good or not.",

Year by year more of you showed up caring nothing about the music, which made for less room for real Heads. I wish it was you that got clubbed. \"Oh, yeah, the show, don't remember\" Bill Walton is a good judge of character.  He had you figured out from ten feet away.  Kudos to that guy who ditched you. He got into the show, don't you worry. Into the show and away from you. He probably tells the story of how he was being nice and gave a ride to these two guys, and what jerks they were, and how he was so glad to finally be rid of them.

I bet if the boys had played that first set back in '84, it might not have gone over so badly.\n\nBut putting the in the Dark material together like that (I think it was the same day or within a few days of the albums release) seemed hyper-opportunistic. I think the show would have faired better if they seperated the songs out - I am sure they played 4 In the Dark tunes at a show previous to this one, but not in a row.\n\nBy not spacing them out and by not having 2 sets (of just GD and then Bob Dylan) it was a recipe for a disastorous set list.\n\n1 star.\n\nI concur with everyone else - if you want good stuff from the '87 east coast summer skip this and check out Kingston, Silver Stadium, Roanoke, and Pittsburgh.",

Can't speak for anyone but myself, but I never had a bad experience with the people. Never had the displeasure of the nightmares I've heard about Sullivan Stadium either. My sincere apologies to anyone from Boston or the surrounding areas who got understandably ticked off at the generalizations of people from Boston. Fitzy, this apology does not apply to you. You & others like you were & probably still are assholes. You called me self-righteous, but I'm not the one with the entitled attitude. \"Gee, I don't have a ticket & the band is asking people not to come to the shows without one, but that doesn't mean me. I'm allowed to gatecrash & ruin the scene for all the real fans.\" Please by all means take it personally 'cause that's how I meant it ya dick! 5 more stars for you. You know where you can put 'em.",

I felt the weather boy, it broke through the rain like water starts to boil.  At the Stardust Motor Inn with my family and there was a great impression on me that the torch of society was being handed very nervously over.  Passing were the generations that had seen both the Industrial Age and the elders of the Twenty First Century, which had been muddled and confused in thought about what to do.  This show in particular made me see who I am and where we come from.  Archive.org well serves offering this memory.  A table long and counselled in the ways and means.  Both the Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan serve well to acknowledge the tentative nature of our World as the table set before me knows.  It was like a great democratic conference of questions concerning life's value and maintenance.  Not worried about the music here at this one worried about the people and glad to know worried as well.   Lets talk!!!",
