Jerry seems to realize right away that he has sung the wrong verse (young man moan as the third verse) but he goes with it and goes all out as he then makes where have all the people gone the fourth verse. His guitar playing from then on is not subtle at all and blazes through the end of the song. The Good Lovin'-LaBamba-Good Lovin' is a fun follow up on a great Dew.",

The comment about Garcia's voice cracking (at the end of the Dew) was made by one of the three main writers of deadbase and is completely wrong---I am jealous of whatever drugs he was taking.  The first set is short but note for note perfect.  The second set starts with the tease of the Shakedown chord during the tune up to which the crowd absolutely EXPLODES.  You can dl the tune up with this version (it's taken from another Board) and it is well worth it--talk about goose bumps.   Speaking of physical sensations, the last scream of \"I guess it doesn't matter anyway\" BEFORE the final solo provokes a catharsis of emotional abandon--the emotional content of Garcia's anguished plea combined with the crowd reaction is not to be believed. I'm from Chicago (in the city) but there is no crowd--outside of a Hampton one--that even exists in the same universe as MSG.  The ending to the Dew is well documented and deserving of the legend.  Garcia starts playing the la bamba in the middle of Good Lovin and then sings it wonderfully, as he did throughout that tour.  Never thought you'd hear him scream \"Soy Capitan\" to an adoring crowd hugh?  It was just one of those nights. It's scary to think of how many there were before Brent's passing that is.  In addition, to me, it was the best Heaven's Door they ever did (Frost 5.1.88 is also stunning)--IMHO, this show went a long way in marking his return to full strength.  You can fit the first set and post space on one disc if you are only allowed one post 85 CD on your person.  One of those very rare modern shows that shreds front to back, and no doubt, one for the ages.   \nDstone5553@aol.com",

The date was 7/7/89, and that show smoked when I listened to it later. In fact, I can weigh in on the debate about the best Scarlet-Fire, as I think this one is WAY up there.

This Bird Song seemed twice as long to me at the time than it actually was, just because it was so different.  (Review initially posted 1/06, edit 7/22/06)  I wonder if this is really all of the Bird Song or if part of it got cropped due to a tape flip?  The folks in front of me were taping, and they said the first set went a bit over 45 min.\n\nThe whole second set was fine, but the real story in this show is the Dew.  Now, 5/8/77 is definitely the best, but this one is probably second.  Jerry exploded into a screaming dissonance near the end that literally threw me backwards into my chair.

For the non-Spanish speakers among us, the La Bamba lyrics Jerry sings are:  \n\n\"In order to dance the bamba\nIn order to dance the bamba\nYou need a little bit of grace\nYou need a little bit of grace\nAnd another little thing\nAh, higher and higher\nAh, higher I will go\nAh, Higher I will go  (gee, what makes you go higher and higher??)\n\nI am not a sailor\nI am not a sailor\nI am the captain (Captain Trips!)\nI am the captain\nI live for you\nI live for you\n\ngorgeous girl\ngorgeous girl\ngorgeous girl\" \n\n(\"Bamba\" actually means \"hottie\", \"bombshell\", \"hot mama\", or something along those lines.  This may be a semi-pornographic bastardization of the word \"bomba\" which means \"pump\".  Fill in the blanks...) Screaming, understated second set.",

When is a Madison Square Garden not a jammin\u2019 show?  LOL  That crowd knows how to rock and inspire the band to play better (like the Hampton crowds).  You know you\u2019re in for a treat when Weir starts the show by saying, \u201cHey Rocky\u2026watch me levitate Garcia!\u201d  LOL  Pretty funny\u2026  This show smokes!  Hell in a Bucket sets the tone for this incredible night.  The band is totally on!  Just listen to Bobby\u2019s vocals and Garcia\u2019s guitar on the opener.  Amazing!  They just cruise right into Sugaree after that\u2026  Bird Song has the crowd in a mellow state frenzy with Garcia\u2019s lazy guitar playing, while setting the stage for greater things to come.  Gotta love Brent\u2019s backup vocals and keyboards on this song.\n\nThe 2nd set gets all the accolades because the 1st set is rather short.  However, every single song from this show is \u201cright-on\u201d from the beginning to the end.  Anytime you start a set with Shakedown (as in 6-30-85, Merriweather, 2nd set), the crowd gets spoiled, big-time!  By the way, the 6-30-85 Shakedown is one of the top 3 Shakedowns of all-time, IMHO.  Terrapin is off-the-hook, as always.  GDTRFB > Watchtower > Morning Dew > Good Lovin\u2019 > La Bamba > Good Lovin > Heavens Door is absolutely ridiculous!  Just sic, man\u2026  May be one of the best sequences ever for a set!  In fact, this 2nd set is easily one of the best sets of all time!\n\nThe Dew is certainly one of the best Dews from the \u201880s\u2026maybe of all time!  The same could be said for Knocking on Heavens Door.  Jerry elevates his vocals and guitar during the last 3 minutes of Dew like never before!  Absolutely breathtaking!!  Even Jerry\u2019s singing in La Bamba is impressive.  Okay, he\u2019s no Lou Diamond Phillips (the actor from the movie, La Bamba), but Phillips\u2019 air guitar ain\u2019t no Garcia or Los Lobos, either!  LOL\n\nBy the way, the video for Good Lovin\u2019 > La Bamba > Good Lovin\u2019 is on YouTube.  Check it out!  If you are a Good Lovin' freak like me, then you definitely need to check out the one from 11-1-79.  My favorite to date!

This is an above average 87 show and not much more. The Dew is a damn good latter day version but not even in the same universe as 5-2-70, 5-26-72, 10-19-73, 10-18-74 or 5-8-77, not even fucking close man. Jerry's voice is pretty ragged and IMO it doesn't have the musical fireworks to live up to the massive hype. Hell I think 6-15-93 has a better Dew (yes I said 93). Also Dew should close the show. I hate those 80s versions where they go into some Bobby cheesefest like T Stones or Good Lovin after a heartrending Dew, on this version they dont even drop the bomb at the end! \nI think this show may be a classic example of the overhyped east coast show that is so common. \nShort first set. Funky Shakedown opens sweet second set. La Bamba is an embarassment, thank god they shelved it. Sweet Knockin' \nGood, not grate IMHO.\n4+ stars for 87.",

I did see a lot of shows on the WEST coast during the mid 80's and I promise you none were as good as this one sounds, I wish I could have been there! The emotion Jerry brings out on Dew is unbelievable. This is my favorite live version of any song, ever, and I have a big collection of music, just like most of you. I think more than anything this show, or rather, the FEELING that listening to this show gives you, is the feeling I always want to have when I think back on those days. I just listened to both sets again in the car today and thought I would come on here and put this out there.

      "review_text": "Top Ten for 1987 ! Even though the Dead's quality of playing during the 1980's was a hit or miss affair, depending on the year, there were certain runs at certain venues that you could always count on for the Dead being on their game and playing some memorable music. Madison SG was one of those places (see also MSG runs in 1990 and 1991).\nI've wanted to review this show for a long time. Although I admit it's a slam dunk for a top ten, the majesty of this show can't be passed over, even at the risk of being cliche.\nAs with many of these 87 post-coma shows, there are not many trippy or long jams. But the clarity and strength of the playing quickly overcomes such critical bias. This show simply rocks.\n\nBucket blazes out with an attitude and sound that makes me think of the Beatles recording Revolution (the fast version). Listen to the guitars, what edge and drive!!\nSugaree is taken at a good tempo, laid back but with a kick. Jerry really stretches out the solo, plus delivers some not so croaky vocals. Okay, two great songs out of the gate, Bucket and Sugaree. Candyman shows that Jerry is feeling comfortable and is in his \"epic song\" mood. You know, the legend, ballad type of songs with symbolic lyrics that point both inward to the personal psyche and outward to the cosmos.\nBird Song is one of those. So is Terrapin, so is Morning Dew. And we get them all tonight.\nI don't care much for Jerry's wah pedal use on Candyman, however. I prefer the older style Candyman. But, I'm sure if you were present and dosed, it sounded amazing.\nMasterpiece was predictable, as in the Fall of 1987 they played a Dylan song almost every show.\nWe get a good version from Bob here, and the Dead do their best to sound like the Band with fine honky-tonk piano from Brent. Rather than drag along, Masterpiece continues the momentum and prepares us for a stellar Bird Song. Again, Jerry's voice is quite good here. The drummers weave tapestries of pulses behind Jerry on the jams, yet never get in the way. Garcia churns up the lightning with lots of Townsend type strumming. The crowd cheers the return of the chorus, and BTW - that's a nice feature of this SBD in that you do get a bit of the feel of the hall and the crowd in the mix. And for a mega-emotional show like this one, some crowd reaction is an essential part of the listening experience.\n\nSet One is solid, with no embarrassing songs. Although there is nothing really 5 star outstanding about the set, it gets the job done.\nThe trickster element of this show is that you're not expecting the Warp Ten over the top music that's to follow in Set Two, especially in the post Drums section.\n\nShakedown is a fantastic spine-shaking start to the set. Jerry and Phil lay down the funk even George Clinton would be proud of. Women continues the danceable theme with lots of energy and great B3 work from Brent. A long call and response coda follows - which drops us squarely into the first chiming chord of Terrapin !!\nSome have called Terrapin the Dark Star of the 1980's, and indeed it does have a similar beat and often serves (though not to my satisfaction) as a substitute trippy jam vehicle for the second set. But here the \"inspiration does flow\". Jazz fusion, prog rock, call it whatever. The whole band is in synch. Jerry hits the notes with confidence and the drummers thunder with passion. Is this the Who?? Wow!! And the crowd goes wild.\n\nThis is a show where you have to wonder what goodies awaited the band backstage during the break. Because as good as the show is up to this point, when they start Space, it's obvious they've decided to play at another level entirely. The post drums is almost like another show. Lots of mellow digital noodling from Garcia with quiet background layers from Bob.\nWell your brain is on the ceiling by now, and so not expecting the boogie down version of GDTRFB that suddenly erupts out of nowhere. A rare treat (they only played it 9 times in 1987). This will not be the only surprise. Sparkling leads from Jerry and Brent's B3 is driving the train to gospel glory land.\nAnd what can you say about this version of Watchtower? It's not quite as good as the version by Hendrix on Ladyland. Beyond that, all critique is pointless. Scorching guitar, drums that sound like John Bonham on steroids. A blast of sound another reviewer compared to the Maxell tape commercial - I have to agree!! Brent's B3 growls and roars. Garcia flies high above the waves.\nA simple Bobby rock song would give an emotional rest here, but such is not to be. What follows is one of the greatest Morning Dews on record, anytime, anywhere. This song can be slow, long and boring. Or if all the right elements are present - it can rattle you to the core. This is one of those!! Phil can't play any lower without opening a time-space portal. Jerry can't play with any more passion without igniting his guitar.\nAnd again, Garcia's voice really delivers the goods. Poignant after the coma, to say the least.\nJesus, Mary and Joseph, I'm surprised the whole building didn't collapse!! The crowd is losing their minds by the mega climax. Fireworks would have been appropriate here.\nThe Dead suddenly summons their second (or third) wind and decide to rock it out to the finish with this unique sandwich of Good Lovin with La Bamba.\nAnd Heaven's Door is a dessert when we're already full, but we can't resist the temptation to experience ecstasy one more time.\n\nA show for the ages. And a good one to play for friends that believe the Dead went downhill after Pigpen died. This whole MSG run is good, BTW and worth getting. But this one is special. 5 stars.\nNo goose bumps yet? Check thy pulse!\n\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",
