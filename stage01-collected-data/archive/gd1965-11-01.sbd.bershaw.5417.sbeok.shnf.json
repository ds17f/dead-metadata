I first hear the Mingus track at around the 2:15 mark during \u201cSpeed Limit\u201d and it comes in and out sporadically up until around the 5:00 mark.  Prior to that, around 1:50 or so you can hear a saxophone, which is John Coltrane, which is from the tune \u201cAisha\u201d on his album \u201cOl\u00e9\u201d. \n",

In fact, if you listen closely with headphones on, you can hear that it's a mosaic of various prerecorded tracks, including spoken word and instrumental pieces.  It's sad to say, but this clearly is not an early recording from an acid session.\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, this is not the Grateful Dead.  It sounds like an unfinished project, something that Kesey started while under the influence at some point in time.\n\nI suppose it's one place to start the Grateful Dead journey.  However, don't get your hopes up.",
