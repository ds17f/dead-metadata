Weir had to tell the crowd to \"take a step back\" a couple of times.  He did so with weary resignation in his voice.  I'm not sure he appreciated the tricks Healy was playing with his voice as he tried to get the crowd to move back.  That set the stage for an angry version of that song.  Weir was jacked and it shows.  Also note how he ends the set. \"we're gonna take a break, everybody move back!\"  I was, um...out there at the time and having a band member pissed at the crowd definetly put a bummer on my head.  All was well by the time Shakedown Street started. Check out the Jack Straw, it's interesting to hear them playing angry.",

Weir was getting ticked off because he had to keep asking the crowd to cooperate, and no one near the front was listening or attempting to move back. At the time it was kind of a buzzkill and I didn't really enjoy the show as much as others from that time period, but listening to this recording makes me realize it was still good. Never really was a big fan of the Dead's rendition of Revolution.",

      "review_text": "The depths of misery Listening to this, I wonder if they were having any fun.  Actually, I have a sneaking suspicion they weren't.  Bobby sounds really tired and aggravated pleading with the crowd to step back, there's nothing lighthearted about it.  Jerry sounds really out of it.  He was in the deepest, darkest depths of junkie life at this point, and you can hear it.  It's tragic to hear such a brilliant person literally disintegrating onstage.  We know he pulled out of it and had a renaissance in the late-80's, but at this point no one could have predicted that.  The band must have thought he could die any day, and he was only 42 years old!  Listening to him sing Black Peter is like listening to a man sing his own epitaph.  As far as the Jack Straw, it is a solid version, but knowing all the background makes it seem like a bad vibe.  It is a little long, but like the version from 8/22/93 it kind of starts to sound like killing time towards the end.  For a really explosive, Brent-era Jack Straw, the one from Go To Nassau is really hard to beat.  Also, Garcia starts off Shakedown by not only blowing the first line, but basically just going, \"EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...\"  That's a buzzkill.  Aside from all that, this a pretty good sounding soundboard from a year where you don't hear very many good SBD's.  Don't get me wrong, they could still turn in a good show during this period, just check out 10/12/84 if you want a completely opposite vibe from this.",

      "review_text": "Night of the Living Dead A nice First Set, the highlights being the Bird Song and a ridiculous Jack Straw with the whole band firing on all cylinders. The Shakedown to open the Second Set is classic with Jerry ripping huge wah solos; very funky. The Samson is fun, but sloppy. Jerry's backup vocals on this are awesome \"DOOOOWN!!\" A nice He's Gone with some poignant vocals by Jerry. Smokestack is always a winner. The back end of this show is super. Very nice Wheel. The Other One is out of this world. With \nthe whole band throwing themselves out of the stupor they were in. Jerry is out of his head on this one and the solos just keep rising and rising\nPhil and the Drummers are keeping up a ferocious beat. This version has no let up. And then a monster Black Peter. The previous reviewer was right: Jerry sounds like he is singing about himself on this one, as he was in horrible shape by late 84 and probably close to kicking the bucket(luckily he somewhat sobered up later), but this makes this Black Peter even more special. Jerry sings his heart out and the band is \nsuper tight. A big solo for the break. The \"Come and See\" cresendo is raw pain and emotion from Jerry. The song finishes with a long brutal solo by Jerry with some nice feedback. The quintessential Junky Jerry Black Peter. A good Lovelight to finish it off. \n\nOverrall, by late 84 the band has taken a turn for the worse in terms of tightness. The summer 84 shows are very tight and energetic, but here they sound tired until the Second Set, especially revving it up for the back end. Jerry was absolutely lost in a Persian Haze, but even the most uneven shows have their golden moments that make the ride all worth it. Get this for the Jackie and the Second Set.\n\nRecommended \n\npeace\nfireonshakedownstreet",

It's by far the wildest version they ever played.  It's alsolutely nuts!  Maybe I should hear the whole show to see if there is anything else to keep.  I love the difference between the Europe '72 Jack Straw and this one.  The difference is so incredibly vast, it's amazing... almost as wide as the Grand Canyon.  Now that I've listened to it,  its pretty darn good... that's because Jerry sounds better than usual (for most of the show at least), and The Boyz seem to have a little X-tra \"Take a step back!\" edge tonight. Thanks kids for pissing off Bobby in the 1st set... just what The Boyz needed!  I like the, thrice played in '84, Smokestack > Jam. Very nice finish too.  I'll have to up from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 stars.

At this time in the game the dead were normally suspending their PA system from the roof scaffolding and playing in mid-sized hockey/bball arenas. The Dome being a soft roof didn't have the support for PA suspension so they went old school and built up with stacks off the stage platform with a massive wall of drivers to fill the hugeness of the venue. The crowd was pumped and mayhem enused with the floor seats being flooded with crashers. I ended up fdc about 100' from the stage, Phil's bombs were so loud I remember my pants vibrating against my legs. I love this first set nice thick sound. Great Birdsong & The Jack Straw is indeed one to behold, I remember thinking \"Setbreak!? man, you guys were just getting revved up\"...little did I know what was in store for us. \n\nAt setbreak I kept hearing people in the concourse and in the seats mentioning shakedown like pssst..Shakedown! etc. the place was kind of a buzz with it, it was weird as I was hopin for one. My reasoning at the time for them to play Shakedown was I thought it would be a perfrect song for the 'Cuse as the Shakedown St. album cover to me looked exactly like a scene from Syracuse's Salina Street. They came out and completely tore up the joint with it and the place turned into a popcorn machine 40,000 of us all bouncin to Shakedown. The rest of the set was on fire as well, one of the few 80's post space segments that really keeps up the momentum and fire. What people were suspecting to be a weak show due to how huge it was went down as an east coast standout. \n\nAlthough this SBD does some justice, soundboards tend to lose the full energy of the building, to get the feel for the energy of this eve a HQ FOB AUD is needed. There are a ton of HQ audiences out there of this show I know I have heard them, anyone care to upload at least one?\n\nPlease.",

We got to the campus very early and actually parked right next to the Dome.  After wandering around all day, visiting and scaring our straight laced friend from High school (we were...ahem...) we decided to go in.  Well, we soon found ourselves floating along in this GIGANTIC crowd of a hundreds if not a thousand or more people down on this little courtyard all moving towards the same small double doors.  Very slow and squashed. (Happily, no one panicked) I remember seeing these dudes standing on the walk way above us laughing because every other door into the place was wide open!  At any rate, we got inside the door literally as the lights went down.  We ran inside the arena at Bertha started.  This was one of the few shows I saw where I really think just that one song was well worth th price of admission.  The fact that there were 20 or so songs after it just makes me shake my head with wonder and thankfulness I got to be part of this kind of experience.  Let's see, who else remembers jumping up and down outside the Dome between the pillars and making that warbling sound? I remember thinking holy shit, theres like 15 thousand folding chairs out on the field.  And then you can see these tractor trailers tiny as can be down there next to the stage.

After catching some shut eye, a buddy of mine talked me into leaving the van to go for a walk.  Maybe play some hack, walk around check out the scene/girls etc.... I agreed and we set off on a beautiful crisp fall morning..\nIt was when I returned to the TransVan (dubbed 'the pressure cooker' on the ride home)that the trouble began.  As I came up along side of the camper I saw my buddy across the next aisle jumping up and down waving his arms.....He was shouting something...\"six...six six up?? six up?? 5-0...?\" \nI stopped next to the camper about to walk in the side door and kinda smiled at him like,  \"what the fuck???\" just then a guy in a blue windbreaker with DEA written in big yellow letters comes walking around the back of the camper. I immediatly pretended to be walking past the van like I didn't live there, checked my back pocket for my ID (thank god I had it) and headed accross the aisle to my friend.\nApparently, the aforementioned dumbass that threw the beer bottles out of the van's first act as a guest of the Grateful Dead scene was to buy a sheet of vitamin 'c' and start selling doses out of the van.  \nMy friend and I with the rest of the crew (There was only one other unlucky guy in the van with dufus when they raided)that drove out there with us sat for about an hour while they ripped through all of our shit.\nUltimatly, since there was only person in our group (our commisioned driver who happened to be 18)that drove; he bravely came forward and told the agents that he was the designated driver for the group.  He frankly told them that there was a 'few other's' that came with him that were not involved in selling doses.\nIn a strange case of 'luck' the DEA told him and I'll never forget it....\"Get the fuck out of New York or we will take this van, rip it to pieces and crush it...\" My friend said, 'yes sir, as soon as possible..'.\nThey took the two guys to jail that day, one was released but he missed the show.  I didn't see \"beer bottle boy\" for years.  He ended up going to jail for selling LSD to a Federal agent where he ultimatly found Jesus and became a born again Christian. I am sure he never saw another Dead show again...\nAs for the survivors, as HST says, \"When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro..\" we all dropped some of the cleanest strongest windowpane acid we had done in that era and headed in the dome.\nThe show (Shakedown, Jack Straw, Ramble on Rose 'take a step back' etc...) was perilous, joyfull, violent,  sad and ultimatly optimistic.\nThis recording is a nice representation of the energy from that night.\nI clearly remember at the end of \"Revolution\" \n('you know its gonna be.....alright...')when the lights came up my friend who had probably saved my life and I looked at eachother and said, \"Lets get the Fuck out of New York as quickly as possible..\" \nSadly, a footnote to the evening was that it was not an altogether good trip after the show (for me literally and figuratively).  For those of you that have been to a dome;  as you are leaving the wind literally blows you out of the venue and to those in a fragile state this can be unsettling; especially when the florecent lights from the outside hit you.  \nAs we cleared the 'wind tunnel' we came over a walkway that crossed the backstage access. We came over the top just in time to see Jerry being literally carried by two guys, one on each arm waking him slowly to his limo... I remember he was wearing a long flannel shirt over his black \"T\" and he looked very, very tired.  We all just kind of took a momment and reflected...\nThis seemed to be the frosting point for the weekend. My friend and I looked at eachother and again reiterated our new theme, \"Let's get the fuck out of New York as quickly as possible.\"\nWe did.",

IMO, the shows prior to that were hit and miss - but with the late summer and fall shows, they get pretty consistently good. Dare I say it, even a few great shows were played, 1984 standards non-withstanding.\n     Sad to say, too many October 84 shows haven't showed up in SBD's, but what we have really show what the band could do in that Persian year when they tried and the magic was right. 10/9 is very good, as is many people's favorite - 10/12. I know for sure I'll have to pick one more top ten from October, but I can't decide yet.\n     But on to October 20th - there is a sentimental factor in the mix in choosing this show. It was one of the first I downloaded as an MP3 back in whoa - 1998 I think !! That was when I was mainly a 1968 to 1977 kinda guy, but the Shakedown and Jack Straw really knocked me out. More on these later. :-)\n     Bertha and GStory really kick off the show with high energy, then a slow funky West LA. Next, a hot C.C. Rider, one of those songs that Brent's B3 organ really makes special. Bob actually behaves himself and stays within the bounds of pitch and key. Jerry gets in some nice licks. Jerry's voice is raspy on Ramble On, but he hits the notes. His solo bounces and sails, leaping to high notes and tumbling back down to the lower twang territory.\n     Okay, so far a solid first set. Nothing outstanding but they haven't dropped the ball either. And - no dumb Brent songs, no long dreary LL Rain or cowboy songs. Then - maybe the vibe improved after the crowd \"moved back\", but the show immediately shifts into a higher gear with a long Bird Song. JAM time!! This is another song that I think stands out in 1984 in some stellar versions. Jerry sings like a bird here, waaaay up there, and nails every note. The interplay between Brent, Phil and Jerry is like a Bach invention, like the clockwork of the universe on acid. This version has the feel of a warm, sunny rainbow-type Dark Star jam.\n     Finally, if you're a Jack Straw fan, look no further. It starts off ordinarily enough, although the perky tempo clues you this is gonna end up BLAZING. Phil and the drummers really drive the bus hard, and Garcia rips large holes in Space-Time with his power chords. Heavy Metal who?\nThen rippling cascades of notes with enough teeth to put cracks in your walls. Wow, the old guy still has it in him, heh? Only a hint of what's to come.\n\n     Shakedown starts with Phil in the Bomb zone, and it never lets up. Okay, so Jerry flubs the first line. But this version is everything a Shakedown should be. Up tempo, energetic and full of WAH and FUNK. There's some funny delay on Jerry's vocals halfway through, and his Wah solos sound like someone talking to you underwater, and if you were only high enough you'd understand. At 8:30 it's Jerry unleashed. Then everybody jumps in the jam. Listen to Brent's fine jazz fusion piano playing. A standout version by any year's standards, even 1979 or 1981. More delay vocals at the end - must have been a freak for those dosed at the show!!\n     Samson keeps the pace up with more blazing guitar work from Garcia. The man doesn't run out of ideas tonight, his voice is rugged but his fingers are on steroids. A hot version and another standout for me.\n     By now it's clear the band is in a funky, bluesy mood - and so the He's Gone and Smokestack that follow seem natural, yet special. He's Gone had only been played once since July, and Smokestack had just recently been un-retired 2 weeks before, not since 1972 !!\n     The vocals on He's Gone are crisp, the harmonies haunting. Jerry really means it tonight - who is he singing this for? The post-song vamp is nice with more vocal collaboration from all, with Jerry doing his impression of an 75 year old black man wailing the blues - \nWhoooaaaaaa .....\n     Then Bob drops it into Smokestack perfectly, and the crowd throws up a cheer. A hot but brief version. Takes you right down to the crossroads. Serious blues for white boys here. Then the jam that follows is one of the things that makes this show special for me. Bob starts doing Mind Left Body type chords. But that soon turns into a free for all with colors flying in all directions. Fine work by the drummers here too. \n\n     Space begins lightly, with marimba land sounds and Jerry throwing in some fuzz riffs. Then it's mainly Jerry with some spacey long tones from the group. Jerry's tone is like starlight with the band doing rotating black holes behind him. Pink Floyd's Echoes. Yeah. Gets a little harsh near the end, but not for long. Everything melts into the Wheel theme with beautiful trippy keyboard swirls from Brent. Then it's Jerry, not Phil's famous bass riff that starts the Other One. Ahh... Wheel>Other One>Black Peter - this is a familiar series that could be a 1976 or 1977 show. The band knows how to ride this train, and they do. The band then returns to the pre-drums He's Gone feel with a stellar Black Peter. Garcia delivers the goods here, sounding every bit like a man who just got up from his deathbed to sing one more song. Can he possibly play with more feeling than this? No. And more great vocal work from the band here, too.\nThe song ends with a bang, then a peppy Lovelight ends things with a smile.\n     A very good place to start collecting if you're just getting into 1984. A fun show, a solid show with some standout gems and rare moments.\n\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

Greatest Story was somewhat hard to get through.  Love West LA but it's a slow go.  \nGood Jack Straw. The energy picks up and its a good show afterall...\nShakedown picks up and takes you away beautifully. Great Samson.",

You have to remember, at the time, to hear 2 Pigpen songs {Smokestack} at one show was killer good stuff!\n\nSecond straight year that the band executed at the Dome in the middle of a stellar run (see/hear MSG and Hartford shows '83).\n\nGod bless.",

      "review_text": "Better Than I Remembered Was fortunate to see a whole string of shows in '84... Red Rocks, Berkeley & a portion of the East Coast tour here and there. No doubt the crowds were different in west and on the east coast. I remember traveling from my home in CO and kind of being disappointed with this show, but after listening to it more recently a couple times, I'm happy to report it really is a pretty good show musically. To me, '84 was a somewhat interesting year for the Dead...some interesting setlists though generally speaking most every show that I attended was pretty solid., and the ones I've gone back to listen to that I didn't attend, I wish I had!  I suppose what probably turned me off by the Carrier Dome were the horrible acoustics...from where I recall being (about 1/3 of the stadium away stage right), it didn't seen that great. But problem was with me obviously.... or maybe it was my law school buddy's Cornell law school girlfriend's bad attitude that was affecting me. LOL. Anyway, a consistently good show with few low points...interesting that that they ended both the '83 show and '84 w Revolution. And thankfully, my good friend listened to my advice and didn't marry that woman. See...it all works out when music plays.",

Bobby and the boys went beserk!! Worth the price of admission alone. People reviewing this are NOT exaggerating. GET THIS SHOW!! By the way, this whole show was great and very enjoyable. The Dome always had some challenges with acoustics but always loved seeing shows here. Good times....",
