Yes the Good ole Grateful Dead 77-82 sound went away but be it Jerry's drug habbit getting worse or the band just changing as time goes on they were smoking in these years. They were fast some nights or a little slow others the jamming in the early to mid 80's and Jerry's heart felt ballads,  I personally think they were on fire in every way. they were steam rollin during that transition period night after night. The Band was blowing these crowds at a ridiculous level  at these shows. I can't imagine going to just about any show from 83-85 and comparing it to late 90's and up. What about Brent, with all those tripped out bells and lingering buzzers. Holy balls imagine at one those shows  your starting to take off on shrooms and Brents going hard with those sounds talk about seeing color that some wicked pschedelic stuff. Jerry banging it out hard core lighting speed jams and ballads that tear your heart out like Comes a time. You are missing alot if you under estimate the early 80's. whats better not 86-88. Now 1989 is something to talk about again and spring 90. After that I can honestly say its not even a question of having preference or taste. The Dead from 83-85 bull dozed they're later stuff by a long shot. No Brent, drugs and time taking there toll and cheesy new songs and Vince for replacent it doesn't add up. I love 70's too but my heart is in the early eighties from literally 1980-85. Right when Jerry was coming into Jerry, you know gainning weight, big gray trade mark hair and all kinds of persian/coke problems looming around Gracia.Listen to fall tour 84 like Augusta or Centrum sick stuff.\n I truley feel I missed by 10 years I caught a lot of fun shows from 87-88 and up but I can't imagine a Iowa 83,Hult 84 or Spectrum 85. This was some sick, sick stuff. \n Ps. I was reading a review on Irvine 85 another killer, about looks like Rain which He wouldn't normally comment but He said Brent was out there so that caught my attention. He was and he's refering to what I wrote above. \n  Crazy shit.",

The rare Scarlet>Eyes>GDTRFB is a nice treat.\n\nIf you're looking for something good in 85, you can't go wrong here.\n\nrevised: taking a beating, here. Just for the record I have a lot of positive reviews for 85 and i actaully enjoy a lot of 85. My \"down year\" reference has more to do with garcia's drug use and creaky vocals, not to mention that this is the year where they weren't as consistant on a night to night basis. Where I may be misleading is that you really don't see a true indication of this until late summer and the 'pretty sub par fall/winter tour. I should have probably been more specific. There are a lot of great 85's so people shouldn't be afraid.\n\nand as for the 84's you guys mention, I agree 100% and have reviewed them as some of m favoites. \n\nand anyone who has read a review of mine will know my feelings about vince.",

After nearly wearing the tape out, I put it in a box of keepsakes along with the likes of bronzed baby shoes and pictures of great grandmothers.  Beyond the playing - which is nearly flawless even at the curiously fast tempo - the sound is impeccable.  The jams in Dancing in the Streets, Music Never Stopped and post-Scarlet Begonias are perfect examples of how wonderfully creative and often delicate the Dead's music could be.  Sweet and understated seques can be found all over this show.  But I got away from the point:  it's about the sound - as Deadheads can find great playing in lots of places.

Garcia's sure-fingeredness and lightning 64th-notes and great arcs and glissandos are flawless. My personal copy of this show (1st generation audience on cassette) has very strong vocals well-placed in the mix.\nOne strange feature of this show is the absence of the dark, brooding quality so typical of the period. In fact, that majestic awe that is the foundation of the Dead musical mystique is curiously minimalized here. There's almost a clinical quality to the sound. If you took six of the top studio musicians in the world and locked them in a room and made them study the Grateful Dead 18 hours a day for 10 years, then dosed them with ultra-clean acid and put them on the stage at Frost on a gorgeous spring day in Palo Alto,\nthis is what you'd get ;-)",

Clearly a pinnacle year for the band for that respective dynamic of the band at that time...which pretty much says it all...a band that went whole hog into the wilderness of new sound and direction consistently and was able to have a type of sound that evolves then builds to a collective peak for the style that they were evolving through (72, 73-74, 77-78, 85, 89-90 etc)...a textbook \"successful\" band does this once and then coasts with few exceptions...miles, paul simon, dylan in his most \"contemporary\" years...and not many others\nHad this cassette on a decent for 85 SBD.  Used to listen to the Scarlet-->Eyes..ESPECIALLY that transition which really starts when Jerry finishes his \"heart of gold band\" line...just perfectly synced, in-the-moment, unique, collective phrasing of a jam....this Scarlet into Eyes is a study onto iteself which is what really makes this show hold up so well over time.  Bobby i think really puts it over to the next level and makes Jerry resond in kind...great stuff by the most ragged on band member but the one that showed up every night in the end years.\nLove this sound...love that this board is sick and love this Scarlet/Eyes transistion...\nJerry always had the best fattest richest tones from his guitar...just an embarrassment of riches to be able to tap into that...\nLove the archive.....we are lucky to have this music",

It features some excellent song selections and truly inspired jamming throughout.  Also worth noting, Jerry's voice sounds incredible throughout the entire show.  \n\nPretty much every moment of the first set is perfect.  The only exception being Bob's slide solo in Rooster but even that is passable.  They open with a very focused, energized Dancin' that features some nice jamming before segueing into a solid Bertha.  B.E. Woman is brief but bursting with energy.  I wish the slo was longer but Jerry's voice sounds great and they are firing on all cylinders.  Esau, never one of my favorites, is delivered with enthusiasm but the trifecta that closes the set is incredible.  Tom Thumb>Cold Rain and Snow>Music!  Phil sounds pretty good on this one and they transition into a blistering Cold Rain and Snow that again features great vocals from Jerry.  The Music that closes the set is inspired and features a lengthy jam with fiery leads.  A very nice ending to a great set.\n\nThe energy and great song selection continues in the second set.  they start off with a very nice Scarlet that has a lengthy jam, featuring great group improv and sweet soloing.  It sounds as if they will transition into Fire but at the last minute Jerry busts into Eyes and the boys follow without missing a beat.  This has to be heard by anyone who is a Dead fan.  Eyes is delivered perfectly with more great Jerry vocals and an excellent deliberate jazzy jam.  Again, there is some great group interplay and beautiful soloing from Garcia.  As it winds down Jerry starts picking the intro to GDTR. This version is rollicking and kicks things up a notch.  They close out the pre drums jam with a nice jaunty Man Smart that has Bobby belting out the lyrics.  Wow, what a great set so far!  The Drums and Space portion of this show are as equally excellent as the rest of the show.  The Space in particular features some really dark psychedelic noodling.  It gets pretty intense before segueing into a pretty Wheel which in turn segues into a brief Truckin' that has an energetic outro jam. The Truckin' dissolves into a brief but very intense Other One.  It sounds as if Jerry is about to rip an intense solo but Bobby cuts him off with the first verse.  After it is out of the way Jerry gets his way and delivers a breath taking screaming solo.  The whole bands follows suit and goes nuts.  Phil bomb all over the place!!!!  The tension is cut when Jerry brings things back down to earth with a soulful Black Peter.  Jerry's vocals are slightly touchy in some spots but again he sounds pretty damn good here.  Also, the harmonies are pretty much perfect.  Bobby pucks things back up with a blistering Around and Around>Saturday Night duo to end this show on a high note.  \n\nThis show is amazing!  Don't sleep on this one.",

The Charlie Miller source unfortunately suffers from a muffled low end (this is one of those rare occasions where his tape isn't the best). I think the advantage of the source above this on the listings page is that it might have less of a cut in The Other One. I Haven't listened that far yet, but both tapes sound practically identical, so take your pick.\n\nAs much as I hate Teabag 69's contemptible elitism in almost every comment he has posted on the IA,  I must agree with him about the quality of '83-'85 shows. I just received the officially released May '77 boxed set in the mail last Friday, but, to be honest, I have been more excited by the music I have heard from the '84-'85 shows I have been listening to this week. Yes, Jerry's voice is haggard, and the boys don't always hit every transition in the smoothest way, but there is just something special about the performances from these years (just check out the Philadelphia Civic Center run from '84--sooooo good). I love the punchy sounds of Jerry's guitar tone, and Phil rips endless bombs with his new Modulus 6-string. Brilliance. \n\nMagical Frost '85. (My favorite Frost run is '82.)",

Idk what these other reviewers are talking about. This is a fine example of late era Grateful Dead exploration and musical mastery during one of their many pinnacle years. The first set is chalk full of rocking takes from the Dancin opener, BEW, a solid Esau, a very nice Ramble on Rose, \nand the Tom Thumb's->Cold Rain->Music must've left the Heads gasping for air and in need of a break as much as the band. Scarlet->Eyes? If this isn't a 5 star show I don't know what is. Oh and the sound is fantastic. All time! Thanks Archive!!!",

One the campus of the Farm, looking West towards the rugged redwood Santa Cruz Mountains (and towards the direction of Ken Kesey's La Honda Creek Pad), this intimate grassy tree lined bowl was the perfect setting to see The Boys. Sunny Springtime shirtless gyrations amidst Heavenly Jerry Tingles, this show exudes 80s tingle dancing surfer smiles while getting totally tubed by six Sublime Musical Artisans laying down the Golden Carpet. \n\nMy Brother Esau could be one their greatest vintages of that label ...ever. So clean, moist and tight, with the special jerry orgasm solo, almost wanting more jizz, but he finishes quick.\n\nRamble On Rose with it's vocal crescendo shivers, and a spiral powder line during Scarlet inspires Tom Curren'esque power and flow sprays against an indigo sky.\n\nOh, and watch out for those laughing gas groves in the Eucalyptus forest outside the annual Mellow Head Frost BBQ; you might end up stepping into another tab of Owsley Bear Vision Quest (Psssssssssssss...)",

Great vocals from with Jerry playing great bubbly fills and a great lead that for the times fits in well. Followed by a manic Bertha, blues favorite Rooster with Bob growling and Jerry howling on guitar. BEW is sweet, Brother Esau is textbook tight. Uncle Phil does his fan fav Tom Thumbs Blues. Ripping MNS to end a great first set. Scarlet-Eyes+ GDTRFB is one fun run of tunes the Bobby tops it all off with women r smarter to wrap per drums. Bobby gets the joint jumping at the end. Great show.",
