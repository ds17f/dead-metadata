She said Jerry had played a real pretty song. I asked her if she knew the name but she just said it was real pretty. Then during drums I was getting a massage by that great blind dude who used to bring his chair into shows and he was talking to a girl as he was working on me. she said, Got go, I hear they soundchecked Comes a Time and want to catch my first one.\" Holy shit! Comes a Time! I finishewd the massage and ran in only to hear no Comes aTime. I would have to settle for one of the best Standing on the Moon's of all time. Until today I had always wondered what that soundcheck sounded like. Now I know. Thanks for the upload!",
