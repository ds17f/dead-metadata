Deer Creek ruled until the  new-wave \"hippies\" stormed the fences the next year.  Was there anything worse than the scum who sat outside any given venue, unshowered for a solid month yelling \"Miracle me, maaaaaan\"  Shut up, get a job, buy your own tickets, ya tool!!  cant give this one a 5.  but a 3.5-so a 4.",

More importantly though, I remember Jerry making it the highlight of evening when he rallied off that \"UNTO A FOOLISH HEART\" vocal masterpiece in the final minutes of the rendition.  The verses of the song are borderline unlistenable, but the vocal reprise by Jerry makes this version one of the best.  In those final couple years, Jerry struggled with remembering the words, but give him a line to rally around (So Many Roads, SOTM, DEW, Stella, ect...) and he turned them into some of the finest moments of the Dead's long beloved run.  And this Foolish is one of them.",

What I'll tell you I'm tired of is all these people saying this or that doesn't sound as good as other things. I'll tell you what. This show at Deer Creek rocks. Any one who says different is crazy. \n  It rocks for many reasons. Does it rock because Jerry forgets lyrics? Well, no that does detract from its rockiness. However, I challenge any of you nitpickers to not forget a word or two after you spent your whole adult life singing the same songs. Sing 35,967 songs and see how many words you forget. I'm sure every song would meld into one as well.\n\n  It rocks because of its context. That is what all the naysayers are forgetting. It rocks because it was right after the RFK shows and Casper and I just missed it. We landscaped for another week so we could hit Soldier Field and Riverport. And those rocked as well. That is why the Grateful Dead rocks in any recorded format. That is what those picking nit forget. \n\n  Vince even plays competently.",

We all don't have to agree with eachother. Kudos to you if it rocked in your mind, whether it be contextual, drug induced, etc.....To each his own. There definetley is no need to label someone who disagrees with you as crazy. Case in point: two previous reviewers LOVED the Foolish Heart, and I think it is without a doubt the worst one I ever saw, and maybe I would argue the worst one the Dead ever did. But if someone else LOVED it, then more power to 'em!\n\nP.S. kingdork does have a pretty solid point, Jerry was pretty out of it this particular evening. I saw enough shows between 87 and 95 to say that in general this evening he was more forgetful than usual. Simply an opinion though.",

Ok so I was 16 at this show, my sister tellin me how much I have to come see the Dead!\n\nGotta say, I had just seen Pink Floyd on their 1994 tour at the Silverdome in Detroit, so my expectations were way high.\n\nCan't say this show was anything compared to that. But, my story is pretty kewl still.\n\nI grew up in Michigan, so it was me, my sister, and two girls and two guys she knew, drivin down in our dad's van to Deer Creek.\n\nGreat day, and such a kewl place to be! At 16, I was just so taken by what was happenin on lot, was lovin it! \n\nAnyhow, the best part is we didnt all have tickets. My sister and her friend (who are both very good looking) strip down to bikinis, and wrote \"I Need A Miracle) on their stomachs!\n\nHahahahah, sure enough, two older men come up and offer them tickets, which they took! And guess what, they were FRONT ROW SEATS! So they give me their tix and then they sneak me into front row!\n\nFRONT ROW DEER CREEK MY FIRST SHOW!!!!! Shakedown opener blew me away! So close to Jerry he almost spit on me! And Phil winked at a bunch of girls who called his name!

Wharf Rat Drips out of space, very trippy. The best Throwing Stones ever? I think so. Perfect quality. Do yourself a favor and ignore the people who rip on this show. This Playin is the longest of 94 by over 7 minutes, this alone is worth a download of the second set. IMHO you cant compare the Dead & Pink Floyd, Pink Floyd's contrived, same everytime setlist can in no way compare to the deads freeform approach. If I were in a band, I would get sick of playing the excact same shit every single night. If you want to place Hollywood theatrics over the music, then live Pink Floyd is for you. IMO the music is more important than the light show. I'm sure Floyds playing was tight, they play the exact same show every night for a year, note for note. Post Roger Waters Pink Floyd is a joke. 4 stars for sound and the second set. Skip the first.",

The Creek was a sweet place to see a show.  Alpine was cool...Oakland was groovy...but for me the Creek was the Zenith.",

      "review_text": "wildest post 74 playin jam Overall this is an inconsistent show, but that doesn't matter. The musical voyage of Playin' in the Band on this evening is absolutely astounding. If you love the wild explorations of Playin' in the 72-74 period, CHECK THIS OUT - and however loud your stereo is, it needs to be cranked up, especially for the extraordinarily powerful climax immediately prior to the drum jam. Jerry was very inventive during this improv, really making use of the very crisp tone of his lightning-bolt guitar and creating lots of new musical ideas totally distinct from his usual Playin' \"spinning\" riffs.\n\nMr. Philip Lesh is probably the #1 all-star here, frequently taking the lead with elegant melodic turns and going completely psychotic with rapid repeated notes to build up the true psychedelic frenzy. The diverse moods of this long stretch of full band exploration include soft contemplative wanderings, crazy space-funk grooves, and a general sense of building tension that delivers several meltdowns, each wilder than the last. Rather than fading out into drums or doing a playin' reprise, the band delivers a final huge crescendo that will melt your face and leave you with a silly grin on your skull.\n\nPost-drums is good, especially the Throwing Stones, but this is a truly historic version of Playin' in the Band, and the rest of the show is not really on the same level.",

      "review_text": "Daybreak on the land... Twenty years done come and gone my oh my!\nI have a lot of personal memories from this show but I'll stick to the music. I will say that I saw Jesus at this show...those in the know will know what I'm talking about ;-) Hard to believe it's been twenty years! \nWhile this is a solid show for 94, the Playin>Drumz>Wharf Rat is way beyond the norm. In fact, this Playin is one of the very best of modern times. \nThe opening Shakedown is very funky and showcases the absolutely PERFECT digital SBD. The middle of the first set is solid but uninspiring. Unfortunately this set has both Broken Arrow and Cheesy Answers...two of the worst songs in the Deads repertoir. Cheesy Answers has to be one of the worst first set closers, talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth!\nSecond set is really just a build up and come down from the incredible peak during the Playin jam. The Foolish Heart is definately not among the best(check out 6-11 or 6-16-93). Saint is well played. I Want to Tell You is a rare treat but is really just an intro to the Playin, it's a trip hearing the final instrumental come unglued as they morph into the space vibe for Playin. Then the countdown into Playin. The lyric part is pretty standard but as the jam starts to develop it becomes clear that this is no ordinary version. I would call this the best Playin of modern times if it wasn't for 5-26-93 (as incredible as it may seem, the Playin from 5-26-93 actually ranks with the very best versions from 73-74, and thats saying something! Do yourself a favor and check it out sometime, it wont dissapoint) Back to this Playin-the jam is very visual, like a masterpiece painting. It starts off as a beautiful Hudson Valley School landscape painting, then slowly starts taking on a somewhat sinister Salvador Dali aspect with the trees starting to melt and strange otherworldly creatures wandering through the landscape. From there, it starts coming completely unglued and splatters of color splash across the canvas in Jackson Pollack fashion. Complete chaos is achieved as the intensity builds to an insane climax that has to be heard to be believed! Then we float into the ether as the jam resolves itself back into a landscape image, this time a beautiful sunset scene, WOW what a jam!!!. Good Drums with crickets and cicada sounds echoing the real insects chirping outside. Trippy short Space literally drips into a very powerful Wharf Rat, one of the best I've heard. Jerrys grizzled voice gives the perfect touch to this song of lost opportunities. -I'll get a new start, live the life I should- They even have some 'fly away' effect during the jam the I havent heard on any other version. This Playin>Drumz>Wharf Rat can hang with any music the boys played in their entire career, no kidding! This is one of my very favorite verisons of Throwing Stones, very guitar and percussion oriented. The whirro(washboard) adds a unique aspect to this version, I've never heard one quite like it. NFA is average for the period(which aint sayin much). The Rain is very sweet, this is probably my favorite of the Beatles songs the boys did.\nBut again, check this one out for the Playin.\n\n5 stars for the absolutely pristine SBD.\n5 for the Playin>Drumz>Wharf Rat.\n3 for rest of show.",

      "review_text": "Great late Era Show! I am glad I listened to this show today.  While it does have its flaws, I feel they help to paint an accurate picture of a band at a point in time.  I also believe each era has flaws.  Any band that allows each show to be recorded is going to be heard warts and all.  Any band with as much improvisation is going to open themselves to moments or even periods where the jams are less intense.  I roll with the dead in all eras and lineups, hoping to form a better understanding of the band.",

As with all things '94, there are some minor errors, but Jerry is in fine form, and the band is playing well off each other. \n\nNot sure why, but Deer Creek is the premier venue for Foolish Heart. I never really liked this song until I heard this performance some years ago. I can't really think of a better one. Jerry just nails it, and Bobby does some great work here. Killer Saint, two Beatles songs, 17 minute Playin', etc. The NFA is FUNKY as hell.",
