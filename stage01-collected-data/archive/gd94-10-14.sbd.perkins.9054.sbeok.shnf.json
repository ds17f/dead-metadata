This show was a great one with many first set goodies, including Ramble on which was always fun in the garden to hear all those new yorkers go nuts for the just like new york city line.

Who cares about the length? Ever notice how shows from NYC always get the OVERALL best press and best reviews? 90% OF all the \"famous\" shows are played on the east coast...GRANTED, the crowd usually had more energy than their jaded west coast or mid american/college town counterparts, and this crowd/band interaction inspired the band to play better. Well thats what they say anyway. Nevertheless, there are tons of music writers and \"musically educated\" SNOBS in New York. They love music. And many of them love the Dead..maybe too much...and there lies the problem. See, the shows THEY see are the \"CLASSICS\". The shows YOU were at in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri, California, Georgia, etc...well THEY didn't hit THOSE shows. So they were just, uh, you know, AVERAGE. Make your own decisions people...peace, omnnihead.\n\nOH, AND BY THE WAY...jerry is just aimlessly stumbling through this \"Fire\". It's actually BORING. All of you rave about how it was so loooong, but I wish it would have been 8 minutes shorter. Again, if you want to listen to a good Fire, try 77',78', 79, or 88. Even some other ones from 94' are better. \"New York, got the ways and means\"...",

      "review_text": "I was there and it did rock I saw five of the six nights of the Fall '94 run at MSG.  And I can tell you that something very heavy happened as the 10.14 Scarlet>Fire began to uncork.  I remember at the time, somewhere during the transition to Fire, turning to some friends in order to comment something like, \"Gee, this is really going and going, huh?\"  It felt like some spooky presence had entered the hall-- exciting, but almost a bit dark, even.  (That vibe was prevalent throughout the 10.17 show a few days later, by the way, and led to some trippy jamming on that night).  Anyway, in relistening to this show years later, it sounds like a good, pleasant first set, with things starting to open up unexpectedly in the later part of Ramble on Rose-- which I remember greatly enjoying at the time.  The second set jam came out of nowhere, though, with Scarlet>Fire somehow hitting onto something that I think does hold up to scrutiny.  It's the longest Scarlet>Fire (at 31+ minutes) and the only one to ever break 30 minutes.  Also, Jerry veers off into some very sublime patterns during Fire, including a very Middle Eastern feel at one point.  Yes, '94 had its ups and downs, but the Fall '94 shows were very strong.  And it's worth shouting about these unexpected peaks.  Clearly this Scarlet>Fire is very different from the versions in '77, for example, so it's interesting to see the changes in sound from decade to decade as the same band \"caught the ghost\" at different times.  All in all, a titanic jam, a very worthy download, and a very good Grateful Dead artifact.",

Great song selection, in my opinion, and the music was played nicely (some tempo issues but, hey, it's live music, sometimes the tempo changes -- who knows if its on purpose or accident, it still sounds good in this case); it feels like everyone in the band was happy to be there playing.

His brother left him his ticket on his dresser with a note that read, \"see ya there\". During Drums and Space (i think it was D>S, but im not sure) me and a friend took a stroll around the Garden. In a walkway from the main hallway to the seats, we passed by a few guys getting busted for some recreational activity. And just then we found our friend we left behind. We were jumping up and down with excitement and huggin eachother because we thought we just wouldnt see him that night. It was a beautiful moment in my life. \n\nSince then our left behind friend, died from an unexplained accident in Dec of 2001.

Ramble on Rose and Box were great renditions. Scarlet Fire is unique from this show. I know the Boston show was much tighter and in many ways more driving. However, this Fire  covers alot of different sonic ground. I remember just stopping at one point between the first and second verses and wondering if it was more blues or middle eastern sounding, and the ending well...whoever was there that night knows that it was astounding. The energy during the final build up was something that never happened before or again. Attics was well harmonized and Lovelight (anything post Pigpen is a letdown in my opinion) was still a fun capper. The jam after Corrina is well orchestrated between the members too. So much so it seemed like a thought before cohesive basis for improvisation. Good to shake to. Overall a good night even though the night before was definately tighter.",

Got caught when my buddy told my dad I went into the city for the Dead show instead of the beach.  He waited for an hour at the train station for me.  Ten minutes after he left the station, my train rolled in.  Called home to let my parents know I would be home in 15 minutes.  My mom replied, \"Dad just got back from the train station.  We know you didn't go to the beach\".  I was grounded.  The next time the Dead came around in the spring of 95 I had to pass up a ticket on account of tryouts - I'll see them play the next time, or so I thought.  A couple months later, ironically, while I was at the beach, I caught wind of Jerry's passing. It was a sad day for us all, but at least I got to see the GREATEST ROCK-AND-ROLL band ever. . . The show was insane and ingrained in my soul.  Four years later - and countless retellings of this story - while sitting at the dinner table, my dad leaned over and whispered, \"I'm sorry I grounded you for going to the Dead show.\"  I simply smiled and graciously accepted his apology - after all, he did what he had to do, as did I.

Gotta bump to five stars for the Scarlet/Fire and really Jerry is pretty strong throughout the night.  Whatever his ability to execute, he absolutely never ran out of ideas about new ways to play and he is playing and singing pretty sweetly here.  For fun, listen to Queen Jane near the end when Bobby asks, \"What you got to say, Vinnie?\" who responds with pretty keys.  Then the two share an extended vocal duet on the closing \"Won't you come see me, Queen Jane..\"  Sounds like they were having fun and Vinnie really held his seat in the band well when he learned to pick his spots and do more with less.  I also like Samba in the Rain here - everybody on stage is jamming it.  No, it's not peak Dead but I'm sticking with five stars.
