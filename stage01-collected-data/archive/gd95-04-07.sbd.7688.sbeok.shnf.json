So, I'll give it a 4/5 -- for being a great show, but not the best of '95.\n\nIt seems as though the U.S. Blues encore is missing above.  I'll download and try to figure out what's up.

I was working as a features designer at the St. Petersburg Times in Tampa Bay at the time and interviewed Mickey Hart on his Library of Congress world music project (I was also the staff Deadhead) -- it was the gamelan music from Bali in particular. The story ran on page one of the Times the day of the show (headline: From a Dead drummer, resurrection), and Dennis McNally (the Dead's publicist) provided me with a couple of passes and great seats. Dennis got in touch a couple of weeks later and wanted me to send Mickey a copy of the article, and I asked him for a tape of the show, not really expecting much. A few weeks later I got the boards, on two TDK SA-X 90 cassettes, presumably off the DAT board masters. I transferred them from a Tascam 322 cassette deck to my Tascam DA-20 DAT machine, and sent them off on a couple of trades and they spread from there. I still have those cassettes somewhere ;-)\n\nThis was the last time I saw the Dead (80-something shows from 78 to 95), and my memory of it is clear ... Jerry seemed largely absent musically for a lot of that show, but the band played well. Jerry really checked in for the nice Visions of Johanna, Loose Lucy and Eyes of the World, but there were points during Unbroken Chain and Samba in the Rain where I don't know what he was playing and I'm not sure he did, either ... but such were those last shows. \n\nGreat memories ... thanks for posting this one. I'll give it a four for sentimental reasons and sound quality.",

      "review_text": "Hey, Guys, Lighten Up This was a typical Dead concert.  The vocals range from barely tolerable to absolutely awful--as always.  The hour-long overindulgence that is Corrina > Drums > Space has been a hallmark since the Winterland days.  Garcia's playing fewer notes, and they're further down the neck of his instrument, than in the 1970s, but they're still uniquely his.  The entire group is as tight as ever.\n\nThis was not an off-key Styx nostalgia tour for rent money.  Nor was it an \"old rockers never die\" stint in the mold of the Stones' endless Steel Wheelchair and Prostate Survivor tours.  This simply was the best live band of two generations doing what it always had done best--something different.  The common denominator of Dead shows is the absence of one.  Every show--good, bad, unremarkable, or downright awful--was different.\n\nThere were problems beyond the band's control.  First, the sound quality is excellent, but it desperately needs a remix.  Solos come out of nowhere to drown out the rest of the group, only just as quickly to get lost completely in the background.\n\nSecond, the former Tampa Stadium was a Death Valley for most live acts.  Few, if any, ever returned a second time.  The audience was too remote to achieve any intimacy or even decent sound.  Above all else, the Dead were uniquely a live act who fed off the vibes from the crowd.  I suspect some of Jerry's seeming lost was an attempt to find himself in the stage monitors (or lack of them).\n\nThird was the crowd itself.  Playing a concert in a Tampa sports venue is a large-scale equivalent to a gig in a country bar that has a screen to protect the performers from beer bottles and other flying objects.  In addition to the incidents mentioned here, it's the only crowd ever heard chanting \"bullshit\" in unison during a national broadcast of an NFL playoff game.  Definitely not your typical Deadhead assembly.\n\nSo, let's not mourn Jerry's apparent descent from the heights he took us to in 1974.  Although we all wish he'd kicked his habit and taken his diabetes seriously so he'd still be with us, let's instead celebrate the mature work of a unique artist who had the courage to go out still being who he was and still doing what he did best.  And, as outkast noted, the other band members who have carried their own work to another audience without him.",

Make lots of money now.  Now don't you wish you had....\nThe Black Crows really brought the house down with a 27 minute version of Marley's 'Comin in from the cold.'  They sounded so much like the Allman Bros (whom I had just seen at the UF bandshell a few months before) it was scary.\nThere was a long break after the opener (where's Jerry? I dunno, I saw him earlier this afternoon...)\njust as the last ray of the sun was swallowed up in the bay and the moon shoan down in it's full brilliance in a black cloudless sky....\"We can share, the women, we can share the wi-hi-i-i-ian\".\nEveryone dismisses the '95 shows, and they were rough, in more ways than one, but...\nIt was a great memory.\nA most touching rendition of Days Between - you could see in his eyes that Jerry knew he was just about through.\nMasterpiece and Visions meant more coming from the dead than they ever did from Dylan.

Jerry came out struggled with J Straw and when the song ended his arms fell to his side like big sausages and he just stared out at the crowd. It broke my heart. There were some good moments but overall we were really let down. His solo in Samba is beyond bad. One thing i remember distinctly is that the Black Crows looked like they were tripping out of there minds and a little freaked out. I also recall Vince 'sneaking' puffs on his cigs while blowing his nose all night, he looked sick. The whole place did go ape-shit when UC started, but Jerry's solo was not there.

      "review_text": "UNBROKEN CHAIN, the end days My brother turned me on to the dead way back. I attended my first show and last show with him. This was the last one. In between I saw 50 as a regular head and worked over 50 as an employee for Bill Graham setting up Jerry and the boys' dressing rooms. By this time I was a concert promoter in Gainesville. My partners and I actually put in a bid on this show which would have taken place at the Alachua County Fairgrounds outside of Gainesville. The band was really kind to us in working with our offer, but politics with other promoters, venue capacity, etcetera were issues that ultimately landed the Tampa Stadium gig. \n\nIt was a bitter sweet show for me. In general I agree with the earlier posters that it had a dark and ominous vibe to it. Cops were really out of control, attendees seemed more like sports fans at a NASCAR rally. Odd, a very odd night. I swear it seemed like Jerry wasn't even at this show. I mean I saw him, I heard him, here's the recording to prove it, but really... I don't think his spirit ever left Alabama.\n\nI felt sad after this show. It was my girlfriend-at-the-time's first show and when we were on our way out, I apologized to her. I said, \"I don't really know what just happened, but I wouldn't classify that as a Dead show. You really should of came to Birmingham with me.\"\n\nHighlights: \n\"Visions\" (pretty sweet version here -Jerry is in his own world here but takes us with him for this number), \n\"Eyes\" (i think the only time the rest of the band followed Jerry into whatever netherworld his soul was hiding in), \n\"Unbroken\" (okay this one deserves more 'splainin'\n...flashing back to my parking lot days for a moment: there were always rumors that if the Dead ever broke into \"Unbroken Chain\", then that was going to be the end days for the band (final shows, etc)... heads were always spreading weird ass rumors like this. how cosmically ironic that it went down like that for me. not an outstanding version by any means, but it was cool to hear it, ominous though.)\n\"Days Between\" (Sweet as hell in a what-fucking-universe-has-Garcia-been-abducted-to kind of way.)\n\"U.S. Blues\" (just a great final tune for me, thanks for the memories boys!)\n\nLow points:\nBlack Crowes opening. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE THE BLACK CROWES, but seriously, it was just too much.\nout-of-control cops and too many fake heads at this show. I mean it felt like Jerry wasn't the only one missing-in-action. I had difficulty finding any real Deadheads at this show (a crowd of 80,000).\n\"Samba in the Rain\" ... wtf?!? C'mon boys, what were you thinking?!?\n\n3 stars because that show was just plain fucking weird. Coincidently a lot like my first show, the dead-in-a-bubble-effect I call it.",

Jerry plays lead guitar in a style all his own.  Phil plays lead bass.  Billy and Micky lay down drums that are actually worth listening to on their own. The drum segment is not just some fool proving he can hit all the drums at 4000 time a minute, it is thoughtful and passionate.  Each of the keyboard players added heir own magic to the mix. Bobby plays lead rythem guitar.  Did you expect his slide guitar to sound like someone else?  His slide playing is really fine IMHO.  \n\nBill Graham said it best:  \"It's not that they are the best at what they do... they are the only ones that do what they do.\"",

First off, all the sevens were aligned for me - it was my seventh show, on April 7, and I was in the seventh row. Seat 7. That was crazy enough. Second of all, I had just broken up with my crazy-ass, cheating girlfriend \u2013 \u201coooooo, freedom!\u201d But the outdoor venue, the gaggle of like-minded friends, and the wonderful moon overhead all combined for a truly glorious evening. \n\nBut what of the show? We tend to mentally add to the grandeur of things remembered, but I was happy to hear this again and realize that it actually was a well-played show. A strong Jack opener, followed by a sweet Peggy-O. Jerry must have had tales of women that done wronged him on his mind for the first set \u2013 pretty Peggy-O, Loose Lucy, and Johanna all left him sad and soulful, and left me pretty wowed. Especially with the hot Visions of Johanna \u2013 loved it. Meanwhile, Bob had us howling at the moon on Rooster, and Masterpiece was well-played, even if it was standard. But the second set really took a turn into Trippy Town. I don\u2019t know if the negative reviewers were listening to the same music, but I loved the strange territory in Eyes, the rollicking yet bendy Saint, the Pandora\u2019s box of sound effects springing from Unbroken Chain, a trippily-jammed out Corrina (yes, Corrina, never thought I would get excited about that song). and the far-out Drumz/Space. And then the Days Between \u2026 it was searing \u2013 got to give the old man his due. He left us in tears, as his power ballad Jerry sign-offs always did. Then we all partied appropriately to the NFA and US Blues \u2013 great energetic end to the show. \n\nYes, the crowd could have been a bit kinder and less real-world. And I always hated Cheesy Answers \u2013 coming out of space, it was like being slapped awake by a hooting frat boy. And Samba in the Pain was a real mood-killer. But you gotta take the good with the bad, and as I remembered, this show had sooooo much more good than bad. Nicely done, boys. I miss you.",

Tasty treats, and a sweet end to that final spring tour ! \n NFA wow, it still gives me chills to remember that day. Such trouble to get to a local show in my own backyard. Not since they had played St. Pete in '88 {my 1st show} had the boys visited the other bay. I want to go on record here for the 1st time and admit I walked out on the encore of this show. Being there so early to see the Crowes, I remember feeling spiritually drained. Jerry felt so tired, lackluster at the time. Zero energy! Spent. I almost knew inside it was the end, feeling it, the dark and light, but not wanting to let go at the same time, selfishly. Knowing it could not continue as it was, but I envision now what a break and recharging of the batteries could have done, but sadly, it was not to be. So many depended on them it was almost unthinkable, or at least unspeakable. A sign of weakness? Defeat? After this the news was marred with a new generation of violence, and some of the worst. No longer prankster, but mean spirited. Deer Creek, the porch collapse deaths, and maybe partly for fear of not wanting to get gassed again like the spring before in Orlando, we walked out. \n 2stars for this show is a bit harsh and deserves balance. Some of my 5***** are for being there my final time, the quality preservation, and beauty. Thank you \n\n\nSavor every moment",

      "review_text": "First, Last & Only Show Yes it is what the title says it is. I was 24 years old and recently separated from my wife of a whole 3 years for about 4 months before the show. She moved to Hawaii with my 2 yr old son. When she left my life went into party mode all of a sudden. Drinking, pot parties etc etc. Stuff I could not do while married to her as she was quite a prude when it came to pot. \n\nOkay so now onto my ONE and ONLY Grateful Dead show.\n\nA buddy of mine says to me one day. Hey man I have an extra ticket to the Grateful Dead show coming up in a couple of weeks do you wanna buy it off me? I thought for a second or two about it because I had never been to a Dead show before, nor did I EVEN know their history outside of Touch of Grey because of the main stream crap. BUT since many of my friend's seemed to have already had tickets to the show I said WTF I'll give it a go. Hear a little Touch of Gray, why not? HA! no one told me what to expect going into THAT parking lot. None of my friends. They left me in the dark to the whole scene. I got lost on the way to the farm, someone gave me bad directions and I even live in the same county as the farm to begin with. I know it was a sad night the night before the show missing out on the farm. I heard a lot of good stories from friends that made it there.\n\nOkay back to the parking lot scene the day of the show. We arrive about from what I remember 6 hours before the show. I thought this as odd to begin with as I had never done stuff like that for a concert before.\n\nI was already dosed about an hour before arriving at the lot. I'm sitting on the back of my friend's tailgate for a bit taking in the scene with the guys that I got a ride there with. Then all of a sudden,they all decide to split and go there separate ways. So I just froze on the back of the tailgate for about an hour and a half. I was terrified at first. It was a terrible trip. Then all of a sudden for some reason I realized everyone was just there to party and I got into the scene in a big way. I jumped off the tailgate to go out and explore the lot myself unafraid at all these strange people that seemed to not fit into regular society.\nI got to hang out at the drum circle for about an hour or maybe more I don't know I was fascinated though. Did a few of those nitrous balloons on the way back to the truck. That was the first time in my life I ever did anything like that. I lived a sheltered life, okay. Wow what an experience. I was taking the entire scene in like a sponge and loving it. One of the greatest days I've ever had in my life.\n\nSo I'm trying to make my way back to the truck hoping to meet up with some of my friends to tell them all the things I just saw and what I just did. All in this blur of tye dye and hippie music blaring all around me.\nWhat an experience!\n\nI finally make my way back and eventually we all head off to the show. My buddy kept asking me the night before and on the way into the Stadium this same question. \"Hey man are you going to dance dude?\" I never knew why I would dance a rock concert so I dismissed him every time he said it. Thinking whatever dude your effed up.\n\nThe Black Crowes were alright, atleast I knew more of their tunes than the Grateful Dead's.\nIt was too hot of a twilight though very steamy humid night.\n\nDid anyone else see the skeleton clouds hanging over Tampa Stadium that night? I sure did it was there all friggin night.\n\nThe Dead take the stage and by about the 3rd tune or so I just got up and started dancing like a dancing fool. I embraced and soaked it up like a sponge. What a beautiful sound that was coming from that stage. I had never heard anything like that before in my life. My friends got a kick out of me jamming away the stuff. Loving it!\n\nSo to FINALLY end this long story(there was much more than all this, but hey this is getting long). I walked out of Tampa Stadium in my Stella Blue Green and blue tye dyed t-shirt a totally devoted Dead head.\n\nWoke up the next afternoon and went to the music store to look for Dead CD's. I had a chance to go to the Missouri show, and drove all the way there from Florida too, but that is another story on that show's thread of why I never got to go to another show again.\n\nOh how I wished I could have went to so many more shows. I wish I would have found them earlier in my life before Jerry passed away. I envy the masses that have seen so many shows. You should feel lucky as hell. Every once and awhile I play some Dead songs and think how lucky I was to have experienced it atleast once. I also think how great it would have been to have experienced it Just One More Time.",

At least this unbroken may be the best of the 1995 versions other than the one Hornsby carries in Charlotte. I love the boys and Jerry was sick and had carpal tunnel.  The show has its moments, but its not great.  The visions of Johanna is sweet like always. Possibly the best live Unbroken Chain as well. FYI Drums space is not 35 minutes the tracks above are mislabeled and the drums contains both the drums and space segments.",

      "review_text": "Don't forget there were 5 other members I know Jerry was the central guy, but let's not discount that half of the songs are sung by Weir, with Phil and the keyboardist getting a few as well. \n\nBob was singing great in the final year and Jerry was backing him nicely on the guitar. The drums segment had developed into quite a beast at this point, Vince wasn't being fed the annoying sounds from Bralove so much, it is welcome to hear an acoustic sounding piano on his Rooster solo for instance, he then switched to the closest to a b3 they would give him, the xb2 and it is passable. \n\nCutler had really gotten the balance down as well by this point. This mix is a good example of a well balanced mix. If there are spots where you can't hear Jerry's vocals, that is because Jerry chose to mumble. Cutler doesn't change vocal reverbs mid song like Healey did either. Cutler also got rid of the noise gates Healey would use that would often cut off the quieter words sung.\n\nThis show is a fun listen. People need to see the big picture and not get hung up on the songs played or Jerry so much. \n\nJust my useless opinion.",

Got to the parking lot, couple girls whispered fungus in my ear, They swore i was police till my boy busted out a bear tat on his shoulder with the kids they dance and shake their bones quote on the 500lb shoulder. Hard to handle with black crowes was the expectation. Fell far short. No regrets. Tryin to get the easy answers part of show.  =)",

      "review_text": "WhoCaresIfItIsntTheBest? I see all these reviews about how much this show sucked, but for some of us it was our first and last show for the Dead. It was for me. I missed the opportunity to go to Atlanta with one of my buddies. The stories he told us were outrageous and when given the chance to go, I didn't miss out. The crowd in the parking lot was a sight to see and fun to hang out with and trying not to get in to trouble with the cops. Then in the stands, moving after the Crowes finished, to watch the DeadHeads bum rush the guards and dive over the barriers to get in to the field. I had a great time at this concert. It was fun and exciting to watch. We didn't get home until 3am. I got high and we ate Cuban sandwiches and donuts on the way home.",

Please stop hating on the poor guy. He poured everything he had into us, the band, the crew, everyone came before him. Listen to this again and enjoy the bell out of it!",
