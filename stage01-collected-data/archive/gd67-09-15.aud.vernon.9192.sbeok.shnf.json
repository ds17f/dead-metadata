The \"SF Scene\" with the Airplane, Big Brother and the Dead on one bill, with a lightshow projected on the outdoors bandbox. But Graham left Janis in SF for some transgression and, at the concert, announced the Dead would do a longer set to compensate. I don't know if it really was longer, but when they were done, the Airplane's set afterward seemed kind of inadequate by comparison. My musical tastes may have been forever altered, but in a good way. My rating reflects this.",

Often what's considered a pitiful Audience copy, I can get into.\n\nThat being said, the quality of 9-15-67 at the Hollywood Bowl is truly borderline horrible. Just because it's '67, that doesn't automatically make it an enjoyable listen. I had a difficult time enjoying this because of hiss and dropouts and what, at times, sounded like a bathroom renovation that the mics were patched into.\n\nOn a beautifully quiet and peaceful hike I took this show . . . but instead of really getting into the tunes, it merely became decent background music to deeper thoughts like -- what would life be like if the Earth was made of marshmallow? And terrorists, rather than kill people with explosives, what if they just made people listen to Clay Aiken?\n\nIt's heartbreaking enough to read over and over \"None in Circulation\" regarding '67 shows . . . rather than make the pain in my heart any better, this terrible copy of a show just seems to throw salt into the wound. What a shame.\n\n4 stars for the music\n1.5 to 2 stars for quality of recording",

      "review_text": "My first show... Yeah...I remember that night.  I was there with my kind of lame college girlfriend to see Jefferson Airplane.  I was hoping they'd play \"Comin' back to me\" and \"Today\" and Andrea would be all romantic and we would end the evening making love in the back seat of my car.  NOT!\n     Big Brother was supposed to open but, fresh from their groundbreaking show at Monterey, they had other committments.  So here comes the Grateful Dead!  Holy Smoke!  What was that?  The set list shows them opening with Viola Lee Blues but I don't remember it that way.  I seem to recall they played a bunch of short snappy songs including \"Schoolgirl\" and ended with Viola Lee Blues.  As they played the coda, the words \"Grateful Dead\" magically appeared on the Hollywood Bowl's band shell.  In purple letters!  I got goosebumps even back then.  At one point during the set, Wier asked the crowd in general \"Why aren't there any people dancing?  Why are y'all sitting down?\"  This provoked a mad dash for the stage where the Bowl officials had covered the reflective pond with plywood.  This flimsy plywood covering was soon filled with joyous Deadheads who ignored pleas from the announcer to vacate the area.  The Dead seemed to feed off the energy of the crowd...Ha Ha!  I wonder how that happened?  Anyway they shot everything they had and made a lot of new friends that night.  Oh yeah...the Airplane did come on and played their usual show for '67 but I went home thinking \"Who were those guys?  Those guys were wild!  What was their name again?  Oh yeah...The Grateful Dead!\"",

      "review_text": "ok yeah, i think all has been said-however, and another thing... What a time machine might do for this recording. A blast from the past,(assuredly)a performance of epic proportions(no doubt); but man-what was the guy recording this doing exactly, sitting on the microphone? I love the fact that this recording survived the cross generational journey in one piece, because if you've been combing the archives with a fine tooth comb like I have, you'll as likely have noticed too great gaps that didn't turn up any recordings- understandably so. So, with all due respect sir- thanks for the wonderful piece of footage from a stellar concert, I hoped all the muffle, dropout, hiss-hush was due to you dance vigorously and practically falling down with glee just being there. Thanks again.",

      "review_text": "AUD or Bust This is just the type of AUD that gets me excited to listen to the Dead again. The official releases are so dull, it's hard to understand why they release them. The AUD recordings capture what it felt like to be at the show, and the guitar is always so much sweeter. It's funny to hear so much organ, that real 1960s vibe for sure. Great energy in this recording, though it has its flaws. ",
