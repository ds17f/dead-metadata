I was in Berkeley at a drive-thru, and was blaring Sugaree with my rear gate window open. When I ordered, I turned it down to hear the drive thru thing, and this dude in a pickup truck behind me said,\"Hey, what is that music?\" I said, \"The Grateful Dead!\" He said, \"You've got to be kidding, really?\" I said, \"Yeah, why?\" and he laughed and said, \"Because I've always hated the Grateful Dead, but that sounds so cool! Turn it up again!\" So I blared it through the drive-thru, and could see him rocking out to it and smiling behind me. \n\nSo, when I got my food, I ejected the tape and gave it to the chick at the window and asked her to give it to him. I stayed at the exit for a second to make sure she did, and the guy looked over all stoked and honked his horn, and within seconds he was rocking out to it.\n\nAnyway....that's what kind of show this is! You can convert anyone! (not to mention, I haven't been able to find a low-gen of this show since then, so thanks for posting this!)",

BTW i cant remember the version i enjoyed just something about jerry forgeting the words to the 'trouble with you', it being a rather long version, and them not having played it in a while.",

It sounds so polished - as though they've already played it a dozen times - and emerges out of segue! Maybe the transition was planned ahead of time because the Truckin' jam is relatively short. The band must have been rehearsing the new tracks in the month they had off before this show because they all sound very good for a first-time played. Only Here Comes Sunshine needs a little work - but then again they nailed it just 6 days later.",

Yes, there were sound problems right off the bat and they persisted a bit, but after a while everything seemed to shape up quite nicely. Jay Ashley's Bertha of this show helps to clear the decks and the boys that night were really on fire. You could sense they were very excited to don the stage. There was no opening act ~ just the Dead. If you listen carefully, you'll hear Bobby asking the crowd if it was loud enough out there. We resonded with a throaty \"NO.\" Then, the sound tech turned it up a notch or six and we were happier than pigs in shit. It was the loudest I had ever heard the Dead. Though there were technical difficulties, I became a fast friend of the Wall of Sound. Shame, that monstrosity sound system has never been duplicated. It was very loud, very phat and everyone in the venue could hear every vocal. The GD never darkened the Maples doorstep again after this one ~ apparently too many burn marks on the basketball floor. We sat front row, dead center in the balcony and it was heavenly. This is a 5 star rating for performance, but I could only muster a 3 for the recording. So it evens out to a 4, but a strong 4. BTW, when we exited the bldg that night, the rain had stopped and the stars fell out of our eyes and onto our lapels. An unforgettable night.",

Lots of firsts for sure, Row Jimmy is sweet, but Here Comes Sunshine comes off a lot smoother. It sounds like they've been playing this one for a while. The Playin' is very creative and has nice jams. They come out ready to rock in the second set, China->Rider smokes! TLEO, another 1st at uptempo speed, kinda of twist since first set songs were played more mellow. The first Eyes sounds like they are having fun with it and sounds like they been playing it for years. Well this is where I am on show so I can just imagine that the rest sounds just as good. Great Sound for sure. Eyes is super sweet.",

I guess my favorite songs are the ones where you know they are going into an instrumental jam (Playin', HCS, China Cat, Scarlet, etc.)  Any others? Not a solo- a band JAM!",

We were driving around some mtn. back roads while the sun was going down, smoking some really incredible hashish & someone popped this tape in. It started at BTW, w/Loose Lucy right after (the songs were not in order), and just after Loose Lucy, Beer Barrel Polka came up, which I had never heard that before & it blew me away!!!   It still amazes me how this band can play just a short snippet of music & it can be the greatest thing you've ever heard in your life.\nNow, the meaty jam in the 2nd set--Truckin'>Eyes>China Doll.   As others have noted before me, the Eyes sounds as if they've been playing it for years, and it STILL gives me goose bumps 25 years later to hear how great this performance is.   And something else I have always loved about this show, is the \"crunchy\" sound of the tape---that's the best way to describe it I think.   The DP28 in Salt Lake City & Lincoln Nebraska sort of sounds like this tape, but not quite.  \nNow, the 5 star rating I've given...   5 star shows in '73 abound & it's almost like \"yeah, yeah, 5 stars, I know, whatever.\"   Here is a show that lives up to the superlatives given to it, it has the x-factor confirming the feeling that the GD worked on a level that was so much higher than any other popular band--or unpopular for that matter, at that time at least.   Like Bill Graham said, \"they're not just the best at what they do, they're the ones who do what they do.\"   But remember this, don't take my, or anyone else's word as gospel, listen to it yourself & I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion.

Some of these songs sound like the definitive versions of the songs. You can make the argument. When they pop back up in Sugar Magnolia about just passed halfway through the track, it just blows your doors off. The opening of promised land just kicks us right in the direction and when we get to Mexicali blues followed by brown eyed woman, I thought that this is a band at its peak. and there are more moments. This is one of those concerts. You should definitely check out when you have you know four hours to kill in the backyard doing whatever.",
