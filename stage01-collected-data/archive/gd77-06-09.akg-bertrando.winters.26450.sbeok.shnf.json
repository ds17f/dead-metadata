Donna Jean's lack of pitch actually harmonizes well at times -- don't pin me down for the specific several instances I've heard -- but does she absolutely ruin every mid-seventies show?  It would pain me to not watch or listen just because one element was not to my liking.  These taped shows and memories are all we have and are to be appreciated as far as I'm concerned.  \n     The guy standing next to me yelling his ass off knows all the words to Drums and Space tonight and he also refuses to sing on key but he didn't spoil the show.  Or you got that dork Jar-Jar in the Star Wars series.  He didn't ruin the whole show, just kinda made you appreciate the Dark Side more.  They don't put up with that sort of crap.\n     Oh, there's more to Donna Jean than just her gorgeous looks and feminine counter to the men's voices in the songs.  She adds a rustic quality and a humanity to the vocal where too good a voice would at times overshadow the leads.\n     I'm not saying Brucejuice should like it more.  I think we can tolerate imperfections in voice while the guitar sings to us on key.",

This recording has great brightness, strong range, and wonderful \"room\" sound (good for Winterland). I remember streaming the soundboard (when it was still available) and was NOT impressed...the board was kinda dull sounding, even though it was a Betty Board, it was a sonic step below 5/5-7/1977 Boards. This AUD is more than a good listen.... SPRING '77 RULES. Somewhere on the Archive is a David Gans Interview with Bertando, Jerry Moore, and one other old school taper...very interesting to get some stories from the tapers themselves.

Momentous night after momentous night, the band has slayed these songs, but this show, especially on Bertrando's FOB recording, just oozes with confidence and swagger! The H/S/F really does need to be mentioned again, especially the Slipknot!  Jerry and the boys take it to the stratosphere and beyond, when the drummers are pushing for the return to Slipknot! Jer has other ideas and brings the band back to outer space for another 4-5 minutes. It really doesn't get better than the Grateful Dead just firing on all cylinders.\n\nI know that people have their favorite eras, hell, I definitely enjoy the period from '68-'74 more than any other...but when they are on like this, it cuts through any notions of what The Grateful Dead is and the music is truly just Playing the Band!",

      "review_text": "Reverence Paid By the time 1977 rolled around I was used to seeing the same men -- tapers -- out in the audience where I always stood during a Winterland show -- about 40 feet from stage dead center.\n\nIn the early part of the decade, by perilous necessity, the tapers were quite discreet, and it would be hard to give them space while I was out there in audienceland whooping and hollering. Nun the Less I \"larned\" myself how to reel in my enthusiasm when I was in proximity to a taper.\n\nAnd so, to help said taper get the best possible recording I would tone it down and try to get others around me to do the same. I suppose there were some selfish motivations behind my desire to calm the surrounding hoards, for, secretly, I was always hopeful that some day, when I was crouched on my couch nursing a gin and red wine, that I may be able to hear one of these audience tapes taken from off the floor of the venue I was camped with them upon on that cherished night.\n\nThis recording is just such a thing, and a big treat, may I add. It is a marvelous re-creation of a wildly delicious footstomping show, whereby from the first salty note it is meat in the grinder of pure, organic rollick.\n\nAnd, of course, what helped me curb my erascible disposition was the recognition that show-by-show the recording equipment was burgeoning evermore sophisticated and expensive. I knew from my own recording experience that the mikes and decks were getting smaller and yet more increasingly powerful and I noticed the evolution of these things over the years. However good the taping equipment was,(that one would have the balls to smuggle into a 1977 show -- I mean, one wouldn't have wanted to chance getting their Nagra confiscated, after all!) now after all these years, listening to this I am completely astounded by what is presented here. Wow.\n\nYet, what is so totally wonderful is the recording quality of this AUD. It's really vibrant and out front. It bristles with energy and exactly captures what it sounded like down there in what I lovingly dubbed \"the orchestra pit.\" If the bass sounds a little tame initially it's because the Kwipment Krew had not pushed the levels up in the mix. It does improve as the show progresses. Hey, there's a lot of knobs on a soundboard and the bass was generally the last the be tweaked. \n\nYou know that when after the last notes of Music Never Stopped ended and Weir's attempt at telling us that \"they would be right back\" was completely engulfed in the screams of all of us, an appreciative audience, that you were in a very special zone, indeed.\n\nLike the March run, all three of these were spectacular. I cannot say which was the best -- they were all-in-all equally great. My kudos to Rob Bertrando. I am now finally putting the face to the recording.\n\nI cannot easily recall and I am too lazy to look back through my calendars, but I came to this show directly from the Northpointe theater in North Beach where I saw the Grateful Dead Movie. I liked the movie a lot, yes, but nothing compared to actually being in Winterland when the Grateful Dead were so goshdanged HOT in 1977 -- especially once Jerry got his beloved \"Wolf\" out of the shop. Frankly, the music in 1974 was what it was -- great, but in 1977 the band was all afire with a new found verve that was hard to describe other than the fact that they never again regained the momentum.\n\nSo, if the Jerry Garcia guitar of that supreme year especially appeals to you, then, no, you're not mistaken, or addled. He was especially afire all year, and other than in spurts here and there throughout the next two decades, in my opinion he never really duplicated the unbridled blast-out he was going through in 1977.\n\nFor those of us who had the privilege of witnessing the majesty of this collection of ne'er-do-wells perform these absolutely incredible 10 Winterland shows in 1977 you knew you were hearing something in its last hoorah for the last time. Something about Jerry's reckless abandon showed through on every performance. He just kicked and kicked and kicked our lily white asses up and down the boulevard every night. You could see it in his stage presence with the big smile on his face and the windmilling arm and jumping up and down and the just letting it all fly on every song.\n\nTruly I feel privileged to have been there mere feet from Bertrando and his gear while Jerry screamed \"Help Me\" at us and we ignored him because we wanted what we wanted and didn't care if he used himself up. That was our own choice, maybe, maybe it was his choice too, but though he played his hand he still slumped-over a bit when he had to drag himself through another Saint Stephens. It was a song he did not want to play. \n\nWell, that's how I saw it.\n\nNow you are the judge.\n\n \nNever be another time like this, never.",

Not sure if that even makes sense to some but am willing to bet it does to those of us who were lucky enough to see the band we so love in the city where it all began for them. This is 100 star performance to me. The recording captures the feeling of being there. When the crowd cheers it adds to the recording and feel. Check out Jerry's scat in Franklins Tower  \" come on , come on \" &\" I want you to roll away the dew \" Classic energy from audience to band member. \n To LOVELOVE , we all have our own favorite shows and years . There is no way to say this song is better then the next or so on and so forth. Yes it might be a signature song in the Dead's long list of great or even favorite tunes to play or listened to by us. But I think to throw a blanket over a certain year or years and call them the only GREAT years is to vague and shallow . \n I saw the band many many many times and wish of course I could of been there from the birth of the Dead but we can't change what we have no control of. Point is we all HAVE our own thoughts and are free to share them here on this site. \n I find YOU a bit overPOWERING with the use of C A P S>  Gald you comment though is fun to read such a one sided thought process .... \n ........... You make some good points yet the 1 sided thinking is what makes the review seem like your cutting down others whether here or the day of your EXPERIANCE . \n I remember one time in my seeing shows where I was told over and over and over to sit down while dancing Jerry Garcia Band at Veteran's memorial auditorium in Providence Rhodes Island November 29th 1983. We were in the front row of balcony and older couple kept politely asking us to please sit down, we were dancing and they wanted to watch. I'll add that I was wrong in that case because we could of moved but did not. That is flat out rude. Point is we've all been there done that but some of recognize our mistakes and some NEVER  will.  \n\n (I realize I am being rude now also)",
