I suspect it is judging from Phil referring to the afternoon (to the audience-how large?) as, \"a test.\"\nThe sound rates 3.5 to 4 stars.  The mix rates 4.

Most glaringly during 1/2 Step during Garcia's initial, solo singing of, \"across the Rio Grande-E-O, across...CUT.\"  Garcia's \"the lazy river\" is lost as is the remainder of the refrain.

Lengthy Bird Song is no 8/27/72, but close. The highlight of the show is, of course, the Space>Jam>Wharf Rat. This sort of out-of-nowhere transition is extremely rare at Dead shows; the only other examples of this segue that come to mind is 6/14/68 (\"Space>The Eleven\"), 12/31/71 (\"Space>Black Peter\"), and 3/27/88 (\"Space>So What jam\"). The 2-chord jam into Wharf Rat is an embryonic \"Fire on the Mountain.\" Cool show, get it.",

We never expected the crowds of people and the unsanitary conditions. I held my pee all day, just because the Mr.John's were filled to the max. Lots of drug use all around, and great music. The Band and the Allman Bros. is all I can remember. Crashed on my pack in the mud. The sound systems were good . I can remember the song that was played over speakers when the sun came out, Here Comes the Sun, by the Beatles. I would have given anything for a clean bathroom and a sink.

      "review_text": "Wow...What a Flashback! Summer Jam or bust!  We drove Thursday afternoon from South Jersey to upstate New York for the time of our lives!  Blew a head gasket on my 65 Chevy on the way, but pressed on anyway.  Got to the outskirts of town and picked up a hitchhiker.  He was a local and when we hit the traffic to get to speedway, he told us to turn around because he knew of a better way to go.  We took the risk, and for sure, we entered on the back side of the speedway.  After a morning of frisbee, we broke camp in the parking lot to try to get close to the concert entrance.  When got to the gates it was already open and we set up our tent near the second set of speaker towers (center).  Luckily there were boxes of bottled water in the field that we were able to gather.  As we sat down to eat dinner, someone came on stage and said, \"you don't mind if we tune up, do you?\"  \"...that's when it all began...\" It first was the Allman Bros (2hrs), then The Band (2 hrs), and finally the Dead (2hrs) for the start of the legendary \"soundcheck\" on the night before of the main event.  What a night of music and partying. It was rounded off with Van Morrison piped through the speaker system.  The next morming we woke up to a sea of humanity surrounding our tent. Thanks those who posted this music (and memories) It truly reminded me of the start of the Very Best experience in my life! (I am 51 now)",

      "review_text": "one of a half million stories We burned out the clutch on my girlfriend's old Plymouth as we got to the top of the hill at the campsite on the other side from where the stage was set up.  Strangers helped push us over as the car started going backward back down the hill.  We were 19.  Later we realized we forgot to pack about half of the tent when we left home, so we slept under the stars that night.  But while we were figuring that out, we heard music over the P.A.  Dead music.  There we were trying to figure out what album it was from.  It was all live, obviously, but none of these songs had been on any of the live albums yet.  Were they playing a recent concert through the P.A.?  That was ridiculous.  Holy fuck, they were on NOW!  We ran over and sure enough there they were.  The crowd wasn't all there yet, so my girlfriend and I got down fairly close to the right of the stage and snuggled up on the grass for the rest of the sound check.  The thing I remember about the \"jam\" was that the sun was setting and as it got darker the music became more intense and the stage lights came up, very gradually, until there was a dawning.  Everything was on -- the music, the lights and all the people.  When it was over my girlfriend and I looked at each other and knew we had seen something special.  I said, \"Let's try to get back to this spot tomorrow,\" but one look the next day and we knew that wasn't going to be possible.  The next day was the next day -- mostly a blur, actually.  Fortunately, when it was all over we were able to coast down the hill and into a gas station and spend an extra day while the clutch got fixed.  Three summers later I and Planet Earth said goodbye to my girlfriend.  Yes, there is a lot to remember about that Watkins Glen show.",

Just a few thoughts folks, from one who was only 12 at the time but even I here in Ct. heard of the event, not sure if those 'evil' words \"Grateful Dead\" were included. I certainly recall that the Allman Bros were there..\n\nAnyhow first point is starting a jam from nothing, a poster below gives a list. I'd like to add 10/2/80 opening the 2nd set with Space > Comes A Time from the Warfield. I'm not surprised it slipped through the cracks as it comes from those 'awful' early 80's (absurd but let's not go there here to darken this day lol)\n\nAs for the 'jam', yes it's great, but it strikes me that in typical Deadhead fashion, it has grown into a myth of its own due to the fact it is a 'one time only' jam due to starting out of nothing and really little else of incredibly great playing beyond that times norm... Yes, there's the portion that sounds like Franklins/Fire - very cool, and of historic significance in the development in the songs no doubt.\n\nBut the fame over the years comes from the jam starting out of nothing and heck, it just as well could've been the first notes after the first verse of Dark Star (or The Other One for that matter) were sung. All great jamming, yes, but from a basically all great jamming period, I think most would agree...\n\nbtw: love all your folks stories. I wish more folks would add them in the context of the shows and times, what the Dead were doing at the time in terms of song play and musical tendencies etc... because in years to come, this music will still be here for future generations to enjoy, but the true context in which the times it was played could be lost if not for us.\n\nPeace folks",
