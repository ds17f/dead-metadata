The night before they teased Dark Star so all knew it would be a special night. There was a real excitement surrounding this show.\n\nThis night had a sound like some of the older tapes I used to listen to, which was lost in the big arenas I saw them play. I got a copy of it on tape right after the show but havn't heard it in a long time.",

I picked the right night to \"indulge\" my senses-walked in late from the long lines of dirty hippies (yep) during the sweet Peggy-O, then the Bird song comes out-I was out of breath. Later, I went back to the muddy campsite and told everyone how amazing the Grateful Dead are...they already knew...this was my second show...I'm just some \"Touch-Head\"...how lucky was I?\n\nWhen Jerry sang the headlight verse, all the lights shined on the audience and I saw this-I was like...uhhhh...What's the name of this band/song??? Bird Song? Dark Star? Looks Like...China>Rider!!!!",

BOOM it takes me right down to about the 5th row right in front of Hornsby during a smoking hot Jack Straw.\n\nThe rest of the night was equally shroomtastic - right up to and including that magical Dark Star.\n\nI thought this run, in the Spring of 91, was one of the pinacles Dead tours.  They were over the morning of Brent's loss and relishing in the glory of two ivory players (one of whom, Bruce Hornsby, far outshines all the competition).\n\nI still treasure the fact I was able to take in so much that tour, but this April Fools night was the peak.",

You don't know your own strength.\n\nThis is rare bit of a glimpse of well-played and well-captured evening's frivolities.\n\nThe music is executed with reverence and abandon. It is all very excellent from the start of the first set to second set and its encores. All happily played joyous romping from one song to the next.",

      "review_text": "I was almost the April fool. After just missing no less than 3 previous Dark Stars by one show, I knew that this night would be my first, as they had teased it the night before. I even told the person I gave my extra to as much, that afternoon. I was there with several friends, and most of our tickets were upper-deck, but I had one friend who had a sixth row seat. At the intermission, two of us decided to hit the floor, in search of our lonely buddy. There was the usual milling of Deadheads there, trying to avoid the ushers and praying for the lights to go out, to conceal our seatlessness. Suddenly a hand came down on my shoulder.\n\"You!\" said the usher. \"I'm must have told you ten times to find your seat. Where's your ticket?\"\nNow, I know all Deadheads look alike, but this was definitely my first warning (from this particular usher);-)\n\"I lost it.\" I lied to my frazzled captor.\n\"Then you're out of here.\" was his unexpected reply as he dragged me to a security guard.\nAs the guard led me off the floor, the lights went out, and the band hit the stage. I was pleading my case to the guard as we approached the policemen lining the emergency exit. \n\"I'll talk to the cops, and we'll let them decide.\" he said as he released me, and crossed the concourse to the policemen. Taking this as my cue, I made my exit stage right, walking at a brisk pace. Suddenly six cops were running after me, and soon I found myself surrounded by Greensboro's finest. \n\"That guard said we were supposed to throw you out.\" the lead cop said.\nNow, I don't know what it is about tripping, but it makes me really cool under pressure. \n\"Oh no, that's only because I told him I lost my ticket.\"\n\"You didn't lose your ticket?\"\n\"Of course not.\" I laughed, while producing my stub. \"I just told him that because I have an upper deck seat, and I was trying to get onto the floor.\"\n\"Why did you do that?\"\n\"To be closer to the band, of course. This is a very important set; they're going to play Dark Star! Now, if you'll just allow me to go back upstairs, I promise to be good, and not come down again.\"\nThey gave me an escort to the escalator, and as DS began, I found the friend who had crashed the floor with me (he made a hasty retreat when I got nabbed), and we celebrated (his first DS, too). After the show, I found the cop, shook his hand, and thanked him for his wise decision not to eject me.\n\"You said you weren't going to come back downstairs.\" was his reply. \nGreat show!",

Later, my first \"Dark Star\" and the loudest crowd I've ever heard, drowning out the music, but knowing the right place to go silent again and let the boys play.  \nThis was the night I got it!  \nThanks guys.",

Someone has told me in a previous year that Bobby was a Duke b-ball fan, and they had encored It's All Over Now, Baby Blue once when they had lost a big game. So, after a lovely show, they hit the notes and I said \"Damn, Duke lost.\" Then I realized it was April Fool's. :)\n\nI'll never know if it was just coincidence. But it helps me remember that night.

      "review_text": "Greensboro 1991 Both of these shows were absolutely incredible , and for me the only that might rank  April fools  day above the 31st is the Dark Star . I went to the rest of the tour in Atlanta and Orlando and fun as it was it never reached the magical place they reached in Greensboro . These two shows transcended the  Constraint's of any era and went into a Timeless place where the venue melted away and it was just us them . Samson and Delilah was up there with my favorite renditions from the '70's , and Eyes of the World was fantastic for me even after attending 3/29/90 with Branford , I read someone complaining \" Almost Stopped during Eyes \" . I remember that and to me it seemed that it was intended and I don't remember any major train wrecks .A lot of care went into the Jam on Playing In The Band which was as good as any I heard. . On night two as night one a solid !st set with Bruce adding some great Piano and Vince bringing some great Harmonies . The China Cat Sunflower > I know you Rider was possibly the best I'd see period, A really good version of Looks Like Rain , and one of my Favorite late era Dark Stars after some of hype of the '89 Breakout faded where they could relax and deliver a transcendent Version  to me it was like Dark Star >Drums. > Dark Star . It was obvious they were playing good enough to warrant a Dark Star of which I'm glad they didn't use on off nights trying to salvage a show , and if they played it all the time it might lose it's magic and  just be some pointless noodling, By playing it sparingly we get quality over quantity .. By this point I'd seen over 30 shows including 10/16/89 ,Albany  and Nassau '90 it was getting harder to go to any shows that were as good , These Two were the last Shows I saw that were sensational from start to Finish  .. I give it a 5 because they didn't get any better  in '91 ,IMO ...Peace",
