Hollywood Bowl would put a wood deck over stagefront fountain for rock concerts.  there were a couple of small children (band or crew family) playing with a beach ball in front of the band.  one of them (looked to be a pre-schooler) was running for the ball and tripped over a wire.  Bobby lunged forward in vain attempt to catch the kid (who kept on playing unhurt) and knocked his microphone stand over. \n\nPigpen didn't sing despite requests from crowd. Bobby explained that he wasn't feeling too good.  It was only years later I found out it was his final show.  \n\nSecurity at this show consisted of 20-something age jocks who at one point actually started a fight.",

      "review_text": "Stella Blue with PigPen The *only* Stella Blue with PigPen playing on it. It's just some organ chords behind Jerry's vocal, but an interesting combination none-the-less. Other first performances often sound immature and tentative, but this first performance of Stella Blue is fully developed, as if they had been touring with it all year. \n\nAs the marker for the end of the Ron Mckernen Era, this concert has historical and sentimental value. But Pigpen's final gig is actually a good concert. There are a lot of great shows in 1972, so this one doesn't stand out as exceptional. But it's better than many shows played 10 years later, and most of those from 20 years later.\n\nA good jam in Playing in the Band, which usually was good in this period. Bob is in good vocal form on Black Throated Wind, in an energetic Beat It and others. Jerry gives nice vocal and guitar renderings on Loser and others. \n\nAlso notable is an interesting Other One. There are several quiet sections that aren't space, but have a Sage & Spirit (Blues for Allah) feel, and a quiet jazzy feel at others times, building and subsiding several times before going back into the Other theme and then into space.\n\nSound--yep, the show sounds like it came from a microphone in the audiance, and has occasional skips and annoying audiance talking (it starts out really bad, but improves). I sure do wish we had a good copy.",

      "review_text": "I was at this show, my first Dead show I got all pumped up for a few months listening to the 10-04-70 show and the 7-2-71 show on bootleg vinyls, and when this show came around my buddies and myself decided to go to this show.  Wow, it blew  us away.  The venue was awesome, being my first time at the Hollywood Bowl.  It was really strange, because there were alot of empty seats there, and behind the seating was a grassy area where we layed out blankets, chairs and sleeping bags to watch the show from.  Like a bunch of idiots, we arrived late during the last two songs NRPS did.  \n\nI found the playlist of this show a few years back and it really jarred my memory.  I always wanted to find a tape of this show, so when I found this it was really great even though the quality of this is not good.  However, hearing it was really strange because it is exactly how I remember it including some of the things said between numbers, and of course the playlist and energy and fun the band was having was obvious.  Alot of the jamming done was in a 3 man \"huddle\", and many of the 3 part harmonies were sung with Garcia, Lesh and Wier singing into a single mike.  It was obious they enjoyed the night.  \n\nAll except Pigpen, that is.  We anticipated and wanted to see Piggers do his numbers, but after a few songs it was obvious something was wrong.  For most of the show he was slumped over nodded out and not moving at all.  A few times one of the band members would bump him to wake him up, but not much action at all out of Ron.  Too bad.  Next show I saw in November at Long Beach, Wier said Pigpen was very sick and couldn't be there.  Having said that, I didn't know this was Pigpen's last show until I read it on one of the deadlists somewhere.  Wow, what a deal.  I'm glad I was there.  This was a great show to be at and I'll never forget the quality of the sound there and the energy.  We talked about it for weeks afterwards.  I rated this 5 stars only because I saw the show and it was a 5 star show.  Hey, at least something was left behind of this memorable event.",

      "review_text": "First GD show, 72 blew my mind!!! This was my first Dead show.  I was 18 and still in HS.  I went with a friend that had introduced me to the Dead.  We had dinner at a Hollywood restaurant near the Bowl.  We attempted to share some sunshine in a coke but I got the last gulp and away I went!  \n\nWe were in the second large section of seats and we rushed the stage when the Dead came out.  I held onto a rail cause that was all I could do.  I was off in the stratosphere and the band was incredible!   Of course this recording doesn't do the show justice, but what a night! \n\nI kept holding onto that rail, trying not to float over the crowd.  I looked up and saw something like a cauldron with a big block of brown wax in it.  I became the wax and was melting.  When that became too much I looked elsewhere and numbers were pulsating in the air to the beat of the music and it was really freaky.  I was looking at the band and Weir's face in particular, sweating and all white and glowing screaming into the mic.\n\nI didn't know this was Pigpens last show.  I was too stoned to notice him :(.  The vibe at the show was pretty amazing.  I got some pretty weird looks as I remember leaving the show.  I guess I looked pretty wierd and totally spaced out.  \n\nThough the quality of the recording poor I still have to give this the highest rating, you had to be there to appreciate it!\n\nPeace out!",

The show here is pretty good in spite of the serious sound issues.  I'd say listen to the Stella for it's being the 1st ever (and a sweet version at that) and stick to the April and May '72 shows to really remember Pig by.",

      "review_text": "2nd review entry for this show for me So a guy below was talking about the \"watch the wires!\" comment by Bobby Weir at 1:20 into Truckin'.  The trouble going on that caused that was that there were a bunch of girls on stage who got up there and started whirl dancing around, and they were right between the band members and Bobby knew someone was going to trip on some wires and cause a problem, so next thing that happens is his mike went tumbling to the floor.  I wrote the \"hamradioman\" review below.  I haven't listened to this for years and catching this little part of the show again really cracked me up.  Some are commenting about security at this show but I remember these freaky women getting up there and whirling around on stage like nobody cared that they got up there.  What else about that show?  Hmm..  Yea, first show in the States after Europe so the energy was high.  I thought about this great show all day the next day while I was surfing down in Newport Beach.  Great times folks.  The sound live during this time in their careers was astounding, especially when they had just come off a little vacation time following their return to the states.  \n\nAnd watch out for those wires, you might trip.",

Luckily, the Stella Blue sounds ok, and as noted below, a great(and unique) debut, wonderful Pigpen organ, and overall hard edged and driving, quite a contrast to the oh-so-many sleepy versions that were soon to come.

I had written to the Hollywood Bowl ticket office and requested Box 52, and they gave it to me! How about that for hitting the lotto. So I had front row center seats. \n\nI taped this show, but my tape is NOT the one that has been circulated. The problem is the tapes are somewhere in the garage, and I have to locate them. I will say this - Although the cassettes have degraded somewhat over the years, the quality is still MUCH better than the recording that is out there. I used a Sony portable cassette recorder (which at that that time was high quality) with a Shure vocal microphone attached.  As soon as I can locate the tapes, I'm planning to share my copy. My tape is complete, including the encore of One More Saturday Night. My memory tells me that the only time I had to turn the tape over during a song was during the spacey part of \"the Other One\", and it was done very quickly with minimial loss. Other than that I have the complete show.\nI used to have a whole bunch of great pictures of the band that night, including Pigpen behind the B-3, but unfortunately they were destroyed by mice in storage. My brother threw them all out so I never got to see if there was anything salvagable. The sound at the concert right up front was just magnificent. Garcia was still using the tie dyed Fender Twin Reverb and the Strat with the champion spark plug sticker. Weir was playing his red ES-345, and Phil was using the old Guild hollowbody bass. This band with Pigpen on organ and the piano of Kieth Godchaux had a fullness that I haven't heard before or since. Too bad Pigpen wasn't up to singing that night. Time to tear the garage apart and find those tapes!",

The reason I believe that this tape got labeled as Pig Pen's last appearance is that this is the closest that the boys ever came to duplicating a complete set in 2 different shows. The tape that has the China Jam is definitely not the Hollywood Bowl show ... It is from the Pittsburgh, Pa. Stanley Theatre (currently called Benedum Center For The Performing Arts) show! Both shows rock ... enjoy!",
