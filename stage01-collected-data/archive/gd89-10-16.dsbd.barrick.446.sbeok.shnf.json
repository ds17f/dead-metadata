Maybe its me, but post-space they seem to get a little worn/tired. Perhaps it was blowing so many minds at the show. Anyway, I prefer this show to 10/09/89 only because the 1st set is so tight and well jammed.\n\nGo buy Nightfall of Diamonds if you haven't already.",

The jams might be longer that night, but there is something about this show that just wreaks of discovery. \n\nThis tour was special for the boys, Brent was as comfortable as he would ever get with the band, and this fall tour and the following spring tour would show some of his most colorful work.\n\nJust as inspiration works like a spreading force, the band was \"feelin'\" each other during this time. The two reprises of playin' is a treat, as is the Attics and Bid You Goodnight (all re-introduced this tour) The Dark Star is the first since Hampton and was greeted with just as much excitement. The first set has a interesting song mix, with an unfinished Half-Step sandwiched between an unusual Picasso Moon opener and a Stranger. \n\nTo me, the band is displaying the same sort of creative experimentation as in 1970, meshing their old set list ideas with newer arrangements to help further the jam. Sure they're not quite as young and not introducing as many songs, but this Built to Last material combined with the fall and spring 89'-90 tour WAS a peak of creativity. If Brent hadn't od-ed, this would have continued. So its best to just appreciate shows like these to prove as a counter-example for anyone that says 80s dead is burnt out or inspirationless. Good night with new ideas for Jerry and the Boys.",

I was on pins and needles all evening while enjoying a great show.

      "review_text": "For those that missed Hampton, kept hearing about it, went to Meadowlands, & got Hampton II <br />The news that <i>Dark Star</i> had been played at Hampton caused fervor at the time. It also leads some to believe, today, that if it's in the set list, the whole show is accordingly the best-ever; those four connoted notes. Adding to the weight of this show, it was given official release outside of the Dick's Picks series. Regardless, it IS an above-average show (albeit not an '89 top five) and the best of this 5-day run, even if it isn't the one with the most-stellar moments - except for those four notes. If that's what yr after, cool, then it's a great show. The second set has the new-ness song list but the first set has much better playing. It's a bit short for end-of-run (1:06 & 1:17). Meadowlands (which has a 2017 demolition date) saw 16 shows - not counting the 14 across the street in Giants stadium - with '89 being the final one and the longest run (the others were two-day stands). Oct '89 was a fun month to be a Deadhead and tape trader (even if the best '89 shows were the Alpine run), with the 2nd Shoreline run, the Hampton/Warlocks shows, this show, the Spectrum show, Charlotte, and Miami (with the weird dark show and wild Dark Star jams). I recall the excitement and the healthy scene. \n\nFirst Set. The 4th-ever <i>Picasso Moon</i> is nailed, and because it was arranged with such clunky transitions it rarely got better than this. I saw the first two or three plus many bad ones, and the dump into the chorus almost always stumbled with half the band adding a beat and the rest stripping the upbeat. Here you can tell that if the rhythm section's in the pocket it sails past. Bobby had songs that Jer couldn't necessarily get a piece of, but he quickly found  some terrain herein which allows Brent to shoulder from underneath. Also, Jer uses some sort of cool-sounding Slow Attack/Pre-Echo Delay (that's challenging to tighten). <i>Half-Step</i> is \tstrong and eschews the vocal coda for going into a <i>Stranger</i> that itself has a laid-back, lets-throw-this-out-there perfection. Brent has the middle of both sets and renders a strong <i>Never Trust a Woman</i>. <i>Built to Last</i> is less so but they were just starting to get somewhere when they dropped it (a few months later). <i>Memphis Blues Again</i> could lay flat or soar; here they're really riding it, rocking. After a weird tuning jam <i>Let it Grow</i> builds the whole set to a closing explosion of x-factor...then dissolves with a neat segue into a bonus <i>Deal</i> that has Bobby inspired with fills.\n\nSecond Set. Starting with a <i>Dawk Staw</i> really enthuses the crowd (hey, I remember my first one, too). The second of the \"return era\", the previous post-hiatus ones were 10/9/89, 7/13/84 & 12/31/81. It was great, at the time, that it was back (and not a one-off), but there's a bit of a let's-get-it-out-of-the-way vibe compared to the week before, and better ones were soon to come. It has it's own reprise (not a true sandwich) and sets up for a smoker <i>Playin'</i>. Unfortunately, the <i>Uncle John's</i> meat tries hard to trainwreck. When Jer flubs the 2nd verse Bobby loudly sings over the top to cue him for the goddamn-well-I-declare bridge. Then it's Bobby's turn when he mistakes the-same-story-the-crow-told-me for I-live-in-a-silver-mine. But they get it together for an 18 minute jam. <i>Drums>Space</i> is unusually uninspiring and bland for '89 but (as doug the dude contends) it was ballsy for Brent to take everybody into <i>Take You Home</i>. You get the feeling that he was pouring himself into the music, pleading for catharsis, letting it all out through the song, emoting his pathos in a compensatory concession to therapy. Or maybe hindsight lends clarity but, regardless, he's flying without a net and whether this shoe-horns is probably based on your reaction to the song in general and not the sincerity of the moment. The rest is average for '89 and, in keeping with the Hampton Part Deux theme, there's an <i>Attics</i> - for which you really had to be there.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3\u00bd Stars\n\nHighlights:\nPicasso Moon - not sure if there's a better version. There probably is.\nFeel Like a Stranger - casual aplomb makes it motor stainlessly\nLet it Grow>Deal - all cylinders on, a great segue, Bobby searching for slots\nPlayin' - the excitement of the era's 2nd Dark Star is funneled into the fire\n\nRUN:\n11th  1\u00bd stars  [D+, D]\n12th  1\u00bc stars  [D-, D+]\n13th  Letterman\n14th  2 stars\u00a0\u00a0      [C+, D]\n15th  3 stars\u00a0\u00a0\t   [C+, B-]\n\nSOURCES: On <b>Nightfall of Diamonds</b>, which has a super-produced sound, Phil's too light in the mix and the energy is a bit flattened. The excellent hansokolow matrix has that energy, and the Barrick SBD sounds as good or better than NoD to me. The show is often on YouTube, and during the run Weir and Garcia were on Letterman.",
