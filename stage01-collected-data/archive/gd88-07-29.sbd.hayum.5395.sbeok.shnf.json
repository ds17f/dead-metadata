A minimalist little stuck in the muck \"Walkin Blues.\" Brent's hammond makes up for the stickiness. Boy, those drummers sure are pronouncing their instruments during \"Candyman.\" Some nice notes, but adds to the 'dazy' feel of show. \"Queen Jane\" is tired and Bobby's singing is shoddy. \"Althea\" is consistent to the show, that is to say, deliberate drumming and professional playing lacking that 'spark.' Despite Brent's best efforts during the coda of \"Blow Away\" this feels bland. Where's the harmonizing help? \"Actually, I think we take longer now between songs than we did at the beginning, what do you think? (Phil) Wow, yes, lower Brent's mic at beginning of \"Cassidy.\" Standard performance til the static-y final build towards the climax in early 6's...its chaos fits the increasing cresendo so it does compel. \"Deal\" fits the mold for a decent set-closer. It's dirty and not amazingly tight but gets the job done. \n\n2nd Set:  Who could deny a \"China\" offering? The song works but the transition to jammy is filled with small mistakes and awkward timings. The jam remains on a noodling level because the intent is to venture into much different territory, \"Crazy.\" Jerry's voice sounds too loud, but some lovely end notes precede the dissembling as they allow Jerry to introduce a path back on \"Rider\"'s road. They could have milked the intro longer, but oh well...it's a strong version. Concluding nicely, they translate into a Phillerific \"Playin.\" Yes to total 'funhouse' breakdown during the seven and eights which come off as twisted as discombotulating film techniques of late sixty films. Total Acid-fuck. Reprise starts up around 9:20., and it's a full turn-around dissolving into \"Drums.\" (\"Reprise\" should have been more triumphant.) Anyways, \"Drums/Space\" are a congrous worthy experience until the notes ground themseleves for \"The Wheel.\" Not a rocker, Jerry directs this version to more thoughtful levels, the depths of which I hold to your discretion. \"Gimme\" has momentum but someone's guitar is screeching. \"Believe\" is just fine. \"Sugar\" ain't much better due to lyric gaffes and a lack of pacing.\n\nTonight we encore an appropriately sticky-resigned, \"Black Muddy.\"\n\n2 4/5th stars, would have been 2 4/5ths without 'Rider' and 'Playin'",

Believe it or Not was a new Hunter-Garcia song.  This Playing is on the So Many Road BOX SET.\n\nThere were no more Laguna Seca shows after 1988.  Idiots, who camped in a US ARMY firing range, got the Grateful Dead banned by the county parks commission.  Thanks, a$$holes.\n\nThis could be one of Healy's low power FM \"in house\" recordings if it isn't a board tape.\n\nDon't complain about the minor defects here.

The whole Bose sound is based on built-in bass EQ that presents unrealistic sound and greatly magnifies any minor problems in the lower frequencies. I'm listening to this fileset on Sennheiser headphones which are engineered flat frequency response and it sounds basically fine.\n\nTL;DR: Bose sucks.\n\nShow is one of the best of '88 which is saying almost nothing. It is one of the least interesting, flattest years in the canon; most shows are cleanly performed but lack the fire of the better '87 shows or the creativity of '89. My 4 star rating is relative to the era. \n\nChina > Crazy > Rider is a nice idea and the parts are well enough done but the transitions are abrupt & the second one is practically a train wreck.\n\nHowever the Playin' jam is the best single-song performance of the year by approximately fifteen orders of magnitude. It's a legit jaw-dropping psych-rock mini masterpiece. WTF Grateful Dead?!?!?!",
