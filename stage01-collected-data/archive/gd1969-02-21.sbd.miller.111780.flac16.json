There have been none like it before or since, and I will not argue with those who consider it to be the greatest of all time. The transition into Lovelight is flawless.\n\nThe rest of this show is fantastic also. GREAT Dark Star, and a stunning Morning Dew encore",

I would probably choose this version as it seems more amenable to adjustment to personal taste via EQ.\n\nJust as on the other version there are numerous little anomalies. Relative to the best recordings available from this time frame it ranks very average, about 2.5 stars out of 5.\n\nThe issue has to be the source material. I've never had my headphones plugged into a playback of a master reel but it seems like some are better quality than others.\n\nNice Dark Star this night btw.",

The phoenix was soon to catch fire, and burn onward becoming anew in its next life\u2026 Ah the previous flame of an endearing inferno; seven people \u2018striking a match and being anew\u2019 each concert- they scorch themselves in The Eleven as most are eager to point out\u2026 but there is, as always, more to the apparent. Look not far here\u2026 this is 1969 and the fire is HOT. They are burning in a thousand myriad ways, and each concert the match is struck. I will do nothing more to point this out, only capture the fleeting in as many paltry words I can grasp. Though easily not the perceived greatest show, I find it to be a lacking judgment to ever bestow such an ambivalent title- to define the Dead would be to imprison yourself. Let your words go free into the wind as the notes dance graceful each day. How glad I am to be such a part of all beauty, for it comes together in us- and the Dead? Nomads of sound!- each concert built and taking apart, Dark Star the loom from which they weave this transcendent sound. They are spectacular in \u201969, but to reciprocate the same idea, they are great always. \u201969 is a high water mark, but the flood of sound flows onward\u2026 A great place to stop and see!!",

I gotta hear more of it.  \n\nI also find it a bit sad, because Garcia's playing here is so impressive that it really drives home the extent to which his skills deteriorated over the years.  The stuff he does here in The Eleven, for instance; even on his best nights in the last \"peak\" period of 89-91, he didn't come close to playing with the kind of speed, precision and fluidity he displayed here.",

Some kind of cigarette?  Fixing a string maybe?  He seems to be struggling to find the notes conistently.  The chorus comes off well and from that point on (around 11:00) things start to scorch. Jerry stares at the sun around 13:30 and squeezes a couple dozen triplets out of this guitar at maximum speed.  He flips a switch and and the tone is edgier until the band descends into that beautiful minor key outro and, truly, it's one of the best ever finishes (10-12-68 at the Avalon still my personal fave), particularly the drumming.\n\nYou can hear Phil at the beginning of Lovelight: \"Let's make it a good one!\" The first instro break starting around 3:20 or so is lovely ... not a barn-burner but lengthy with lots of great ideas and the band is right behind Jerry.  Pig's rap is more or less subsumed by the jamming, he sounds tired or maybe a bit stoned, and ultimately this so-so version belongs to his bandmates (you'll note that the audience is not complaining!).\n\nThe Morning Dew is one for the ages.
