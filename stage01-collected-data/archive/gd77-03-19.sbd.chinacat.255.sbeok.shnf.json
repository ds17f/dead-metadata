After a thunderous Estimated (it would not be paired with Eyes until later that May) they give you a sparkling Terrapin, then a rare Playin>Samson>Playin sandwich that grabs you by the ears and never lets go. The Samson really rocks out!\nThe 2nd Set is good, but sadly too short, and one suspects after such a stellar 1st Set they left themselves with nowhere to go. Still, the Eyes>Dancin>Wharf Rat grouping is unusual and very tightly executed. Of the 3 nights at Winterland in March, this remains my favorite. \nDr. Flashback :-)",

First the sound is a little junky - it's got a tad of hiss to deal with as I'm listening to this with my headphones as to not wake up the misses.  THis could potentially be a fantastic version but one it starts off sloppy for the first 30 seconds, and it doesn't have superior mixing.  What is REALLY COOL THOUGH is Keith's playing.  He's got this low synth keynotes going the whole time that I'm sure would make your brains ooze out of your nose if you were tripping.  Very impressive.  My favorite Estimated, for what it's worth, was the very first one on 2-26-77.",

I'm sure not even the Dead could predict the musical genius the would flourish and climax in the Spring of 1977. This show is one of the greatest of a year that can only be described as heavenly. The Terrapin>Playin'>Samson>Playin' alone makes this a top show! Jerry is noodling way out in the atmosphere and Keith is using his Moog synthesizer to evoke pure emotion during the jam. This show is up there with the 5/7-9/77 concerts. I also can't wait to get my Winterland '77 boxed set and 5/12/77 bonus CD! Finally a '77 boxed set is released! They should have done the Cornell and Co. shows (Boston Garden and War Memorial, the nights before and after) but for some reason they are hell bent on never releasing them. Maybe because they know everyone already has sweet sounding versions of those shows! So anyway this show is for sure 5 stars for sound, recording, and performance! I'm listing to the Playin' suite on a lazy Sunday afternoon...ahhhhhhh. God bless the Grateful Dead!",

Personally Ill take these shows over any of the May shows that get soi much incessant hype, especially since the big guy left us, those zMay hsows have gorwn into a ridiculous legend.  Yes - very good shows.  Among the best they EVER played?  No way, not even close.  The CpornelL Dew is amazing, no doubt, but as far as the Buffalo Help>Slip or the COrnell Scarlet>Fire, I think there are any comparable if not better versions.  For the former check out San Bernadinio 2.26.77, that comes to mind right away, as do some '83 versions with truly scary Slipknots.  As for the former I'll stack the Normal 4.24.78, Cedar Falls 2.5.78, and Philly 4.21.84 versions against any other version. I'll take Fall '77 over the overhyped Spring any day.  That is raw, powerful Grateful Dead.\n\nAs for this stellar run...all three of these March shows are extremelly well-played and have something to offer.  I've always been impressed by the big jump they made from Sept. '76 to early '77. '76 really picked up steam those last few gigs - Day on the Green, Shrine, New Year's.  Then they had such a more refined sound just a couple of months later.  This nght gets verlooked somewhat due to the Fire debut and Alhambra the night before and the killer show the 20th, which I believe to be the best of the 3.  But this show is great in it's own right. Obviously the first set Playin - althugh for first set Playins 8.6.74 is in a league of it's own. Solid second set on the 19th as well. But the 20th is the night - the best second set of the three, an amazing Row Jimmy, a sweet St. Stephen and of course the jam out of Scarlet to end the first set.  Stream all three nights when you can. (FYI a buddy of mine who was at these shows tells me Garcia was using the Wolf already at these shows.  I know he switched back to the Wolf for the East Coast tour that year, the Travis Bean was basically '76 only.  Anyone out there who was actually there that can rememeber such detail?)",

It did not really kick in until the ramped up Eyes that t was a special night.  Franklin's Tower was amazing; they brought the lights up during Sugar Magnolia and it was delirium. They were just on this night; they were trying to calm us down during Uncle John's Band, but you can hear them just wanting to cut loose on the bridge at the end.\n\nMy children are older than I was at this show and have their own musical tastes.  In many many ways the music scene now is richer than it was in '77.  But this band at this time could not be touched.  I had been to many Dead shows before this, and went to many after.
