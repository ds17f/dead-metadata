It may be the only instance that a Dark Star bypasses the second verse and proceeds full bore into the next tune.  Here, a  kick butt Dancin In The Streets.  The ending Uncle John's is great, but a bit rough on the ears.\n\nPlease don't dismiss this show.  I had a \"grand\" time listening to it.  At least stream it some night.

If you look at their 5/7/70 Cambridge, MA show that's close to the set list they played and the sound is much better.",

      "review_text": "Just find the right volume and you'll be there This is incredible stuff that is extremely rewarding if you have the time to listen closely.  The term \"dripping with LSD\" leaps immediately to mind.  \n\nThis show occurs just two days after the legendary 5-6-70 Kresge Plaza show (and one day after the great Dupont Gym show).  Based on what we can hear on this tape, the Farrell Hall show might have been the best of the three.  Regardless of how you rank them, the overall vibe of the Farrell Show show is definitely far, far more relaxed and blissed out than either the short and intense outdoor performance on 5-6 or the beautiful but relatively \"straight\" show on 5-7.\n\nThe beginning of the Dark Star is missing and once you become oriented to the overblown sound of the recording, the band quiets down into one of of the most beautiful but restrained Feedbacks you'll hear -- captured pretty darn nicely and arguably enhanced by the (original) analog distortion. Throughout the Dark Star, Jerry sounds like he's beaming his notes to earth from another universe. The music is rubber-like as the band stretches itself around something coherent for a minute (or five seconds) and then collapses upon itself or blooms into a new galaxy, and never with cruel intent. \n\nThe Dancin' is ... abnormal ... to say the least. Jerry mostly disappears from the intro but when he returns for the jam they're off to the Molasses Races again. Lugubrious and awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Good Lovin' includes no Pig rap.  Jerry again with a smoldering solo over the drums ... then he vanishes.  When you hear him next it's with the rest of the band, in unison.  And then:  liftoff. There's some mysterious rhythmic shouting (Pig?) in the background around 9:20 (\"C'mon! C'mon!\").\n\nAfter Good Lovin', the crowd goes bananas.  For those keeping track, I think this might be one of the better-recorded, lengthy, and intensely ecstatic recordings of 1970 Deadheads responding to what they've just heard.\n\nUJB is mixed for the bongo.  It's a short version.\n\nI hope people keep unearthing \"lost\" tapes of shows from  1970 because, well, I'd like to hear more of them -- especially if it's a show as good as this one.",

Soon unhinging, the journey plunges through galaxies to arrive for that stroll in the garden of eternity in the pastures of upstate New York, tumbling past Phil's gates of re-entry to dance in the streets, only to again crawl out of the woodwork and permeate the immortal moment that is embedded in the very existence of this recording in all its raw glory.",
