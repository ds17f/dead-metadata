I hope to eventually transfer it to my computer (somehow) & clean it up; eventually they'll open the archive again & perhaps then I can upload it for everyone, or someone with a better copy can do the same. Note to the person who asked about the Wrecking Crew info: for those of us ancient enough to have started collecting Dead on vinyl, this was also the name of an early boot.

It just amazes me how cutting edge these guys were back in the day; not quite everything, but many songs were far ahead of the popular music of those days. You don't hear much of it here but the band was already blazing trails into improvisation that almost no other ensembles were even attempting. It's just a shame that we had no radio outlets for this music back then. Wouldn't you loved to have heard it when it was new.What a blast!",

      "review_text": "Golden State Recorders, San Francisco, CA This tape is truely a unique piece of San Francisco history. There should in fact be two different versions of this session that have survived and still exist on tape. This version is from the final edited mixdown master on 1/4\" tape that would have been taken away by the band for demonstration purposes. The other version would be a straight copy of the archived session tape made at some later date without any reguard to the original mixes. This would contain slates and extra takes and unused songs that would not have been needed for the original demos. \n\nI was fortunate enough to have worked at this studio 25 years ago. The studio was actually called, Golden State Recorders (GSR). Located at 665 Harrison Street, San Francisco, CA. It was built in 1964 by Leo Kulka. This was the first recording studio in town and was large enough for an orchestra. Many local bands under various names, such as the Grateful Dead, Great Society, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, It's A Beautiful Day and many others, made some of their earliest recordings at GSR.\n\nIt was also the home of an Audiophile record label called Sonic Arts Corporation (SAC) and it had a disc cutting room known as the Mastering Room. By the late 1970's the \"Red Octopus\" mixing console from Wally Heider's had ended up in the control room. Eventually the complex also became the College for the Recording Arts (CRA) and local artists continued to be recorded there. Including the last known recording session with Flamin' Groovies Cyril Jordan and Chris Wilson in August 1981.\n\nSometime between December 1980 and February 1981, the warehouse up the street was being cleaned up and reorganized. Many rare vintage items such as film for original album artwork from numberous local artists of the 1960's were rediscovered. The fact that this band had recorded under a different name might have added to the reasons why the original session tape had been misplaced.",

The band called itself the \"Emergency Crew\" for these sessions having recently abandoned the \"Warlocks\" moniker and they were casting about for a new name. Sly Stone was a producer for these sessions. The Warlocks/Emergency Crew/Grateful Dead had just lost their gig at the \"In Room\" and just attended  one of the first Family Dog Events called \"A Tribute To Dr. Strange\" featuring The Lovin' Spoonful when these sessions happened. They dropped in on the Family Dog dance tripping on acid and realized that these psychedelic gatherings were where the future pointed for them. Phil Lesh told Luria of The Family Dog \"lady, what this little seance needs is us!\" \nThis is the time period almost to the very day that the Acid Tests and the whole Grateful Dead long strange trip was fully on it's way. This is the time when Jerry Garcia, while tripping on  psychedelics, would open up a dictionary to find the words \"grateful dead\" shining out at him. This recording is a testament to the beginning of the whole scene and is possibly the single most historically important recording on the whole Grateful Dead Archive.",

Interesting to compare them to the later years and listen to how it evolved.  I've been missing Jerry every day for the past 20 years.  I love Pigpen's voice and his singing with Jerry puts a big smile on my face.  \n\nEarly Morning Rain is another nice one.  I would have loved for that tune to stick around and grow, but I'll take what I can get.  \n\nThe tambourine and the speed really do evoke the image of a bunch of folks doing the twist around the record player.",

As I remember it they played several of these songs introduced as outtakes from a warlocks session.\nEarly morning rain is supposed to be Phil on vocals, why did he never sing more? \nOn same programme i remember a fantastic recording of Masons Children from the Miami beach pop festival I think 68...Pigpen tells audience to get off speaker towers, then says \"if those things fall over it's in trouble city...oh well do what you want\". Haven't found it yet on the archive, if any one knows it give a sign. That's all folks.",

You get to hear the roots of what would make this band so tight.\nThe intro for Caution is over the top it kinda reminds me of how up the Band could get for Samson and Delilah in later years.\nThe IKYR has that Europe 72 over production feel to it almost like the Grateful Dead meet the SEEKERS.\nHey this still beats the pants off PET SOUNDS which came out in 1965 IMHO.",

I don't know what I'd have thought if I'd heard this back in 1965, but in 2018, it sounds primitive, like a high school band who wrote a few songs and are messing around with them. It's hard to believe that these kids evolved into the amazing entity we know as The Grateful Dead.",

      "review_text": "Clearing some stuff up I saw a few stuff in this thread, I just wanted to put what I know out for those who see this. The alt name for the Warlocks was the Emergency Crew, and from what I remember the name really only appears on Birth of the Dead. Around this time they were using the name The Warlocks, but they actually used the name Emergency Crew when they first recorded because Phil found another recording band that also used the name Warlocks, and they hadn't come up with the name \"Grateful Dead\" by then. So for all intents and purposes, the band recorded right here is \"The Emergency Crew\", not the Warlocks or Grateful Dead. \n\nAlso, yeah your ears don't deceive you, that's Phil singing on The Only Time is Now, and Early Morning Rain, as well as doing backups on a few others. But the reason he sounds good here and...well...not so good later is because this actually isn't his vocal range. Listen to an interview, his voice is quite different. Needless to say, he wasn't treating his vocal cords well, and even in the early days he would do alot of singing and overextension that would ruin his voice in the long run, and make singing live very difficult for him. That's why he sounds great in the studio, but not very good live. \n\nEven with all of that though, it's a solid demo. I really wish they played \"Can't come Down\" more often, I love pig's harmonica on it and the lyrics are super catchy. There's one lost show (I think 1/7/66) where they supposedly played it, so I can only hope that shows up one day. But until then, that tune will always live rent free in my playlist. ",

      "review_text": "Solid Early Demo This is the proper place for a Grateful Dead journey to begin, and is the oldest legitimate recording of the band that I'm aware of.  It's a studio recording, has clearly been mixed, and is in excellent quality for its age.\n\nThe Dead sound like a pop band here.  This isn't the place to look if you're hoping for a trippy solo or something that will challenge your musical sensibilities.  All 6 tracks are straightforward poppy rock tunes, and all 6 could arguably have received radio play in late 1965.\n\nI found Caution to be the most intriguing of the tracks, giving a brief glimpse of what the group were capable of doing live.  Though it's a bit slow, this version of I Know You Rider is well known, and the vocal harmonies are exceptionally good for a first demo.  Can't Come Down is memorable - Garcia's vocals sound like something off of a contemporary Bob Dylan record.  Mindbender is also excellent.\n\nOverall, this is a great historical recording.  The style might be a bit dated, but the recording quality is crisp, and the songs are polished and well constructed.",
