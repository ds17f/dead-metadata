Be he wasted, tired or depressed (probably all three), his singing is very off-key all night and his playing is eratic at best. This reaches it's unbearable climax when he desides to attempt Maybe You Know, stuggling to find the chords for around 5 minutes before he starts singing, and then proceeds to ramble on while the drummers wait in vain to do their bit. It is surprising the band let Brent perform in such a bad state! Painful listening experience, collectors only.",

      "review_text": "Weird Vibes - Great Show I remember the weird vibes as Brent stayed out during the drum solo and did a Maybe You Know with just him and the drummers (+ Jose Lorenzo on drums too).  Jerry came out at the end of the song to try and save things and went straight into Going Down the Road and omiting the drum solo/space part.  Jerry then followed with a great Morning Dew.\n\nThough the vibes were weird at the show, this was a tape that I played again and again and loved it.  Brent was definitely out of it but sometimes, being that wasted gives you a lot more soul when your singing and I loved that version of Maybe You Know.  The rest of the show was fairly smoking and it didn't bother me a bit to do a show without drums and space.  I usually fastforward that part on the tapes anyway.",

And yet, Mr. Mydland has one bad night (in actuality, one bad song), and the vultures swoop in for the kill. \n\nAfter brent died, I read an eulogy by a very prominent Deadhead who was at this concert, and the \"Maybe you Know\" was, in this persons opinion, a highlight of many shows attended (in the 100's). I am not saying I agree, but it's all about perspective. \n\nBut to say really cruel things (\"He sounds like a pedophile\", WTF does a pedophile sound like???) about a guy who is too dead to even defend himself is just childish.

Download it for curiosity's sake and make up your own mind. As for Brent's professionalism, give me a break- this is the Grateful Dead we're talking about. If we're going to knock Mydland, why not bash Kieth for the late 70s shows where he was so out of it he need a roadie to poke him to stay awake? Why give Jerry a pass on his frequently embarassing and inept showings '94-'95?

      "review_text": "83-86 spotty ? Buddy the 83 tour is so smokin its sick. Especially april 83. I love 84 some of the sickest jams and hart felt ballads. There are a few off nights in 84 and more pre coma in 86. 1985 was blow out those Nassau and Cumberland shows were white hot. The Spectrum run were the the shit. Jerry and the boys were like a steam locomotive ROLLIN HARD that last night. The 3 song opener was about as good as your gonna get- what do you want? Midnight Hour>Walkin the Dog>Big Boss Man is so killer-love his solo in Big boss. The Greeks,Alpine were the bomb. The Mid West run in Ohio both stops were again killer. Merriweather was the best run at that venue. Same for Saratoga love that High time. Although I prefer 83 at both of those venues. Hrd to say that 83 Merriweather was perfect. Fall 85 was pretty dam good too but I like the first part of the year better. She belongs to Me only played in '85 love that tune. It's so sweet with beatiful those solos an hypnotic jams.The epitomy  Garcia.(i like the Chula version and that Fire) As far as 1986 I agree with the shows being spotty Jerry was getting tired unhealthy relapsed again after gettin clean in spring and had some kind urinating problem and was having to leave the stage during songs at various shows and missing songs entirely. The come back shows are fun in Dec. were really cool. When I think spotty, I think post Brent. From Vince on with moments of brillance. The 70's 73-74 were killer exploratoy young Dead and Obviously the 77 run is top notch peak Dead. If I had to pick a favorite year or tour mine would be 1989. That peak as good as it gets in my book. Ive listened to it from tape trading days untill now so much just like '77. I enjoy really diggin in 83-85 the most. Not huge on 76 and 78 so I dig into fall 79 and 1980 summer is sweet. Any way we all have are favorites and to be honest I love all of it but like everything some  better than  others. In the case of the Dead 83-85 I feel is some of there best stuff Junkie Jerry lost it from 70's not as good as 82. Thats non sense the 83 got better than the previous year. It may not have that sterile dood ole grateful Dead late 70's feel to it. In ending since were talking spotty. In 83 I would say they took a dip in the late summer tour leg. I stay away of the Frost shows no where 82,84 and 85 runs at that beatiful venue. I don't have my Dead base in front of me but Portland was kind of weak right around then. With exeption of that Deep Elem and Seatle  wasn't the best. Iam also big on Hult in 84 and these are a killer rebound from late summer run. If your not familar with the Poplar Creek shows check those out lots of energy and fun to listen to. Not saying best of 83 but real good I like the Stranger and Brown Eyed both crackling with energy. No need to mention but I will the Help bust out and of coarse St Stephen. Practicly the whole month of Oct.'83 are the Dead at there best. The same goews for fall 84 those Augusta my top 10 favs and Hartfords and Mack Daddy BCT shows at the end Oct and Nov2 show another all time fav and sound killer here on this site. \n    \n  ps I had to listen to Maybe You Know cuz of the reviews never listened to it. That was the worst Brent I ever heaqrd and Iam a huge Brent fan. Slaahhshed is what comes to mind combined with home problems.  Auhh poor Brent, Iloved his playin my so much. May he rest in place.",

I cannot think of a worse show, perhaps the Campolindo High School show of the late 60's, where the Dead play at a high school gym and screw up several songs.  Brent sounds like a dying, wailing goat on Estimated Prophet.  After drums he sounds like he is going to die.\n\nThere is something to his madness.  I can't profess to say that he was great this show, but just listen to Estimated Prophet.  He is just horsing around during the jam part, playing spacey, star trek Klingon-type music around the 9:30 mark.  Earlier in Estimated Prophet he plays the same 2 low keys over and over, and at first it sounded really cool.  But that is the only thing he plays.  \n\nBrent is in his own world that day.  I'm surprised Weir didn't pull the plug on this keyboard.  But I think this show is something worth having.  There are bad dead concerts where someone's voice is off, notes are misplayed, but in every one of those shows the guys are trying.  Here, Brent is just fucking around and not even trying to keep the beat or play on the same chord.  His music is quite puzzling.  That's why I think this is worth a download - because this is what happens when a band member just doesn't try.",

I know that I have had too many drunkin' nights myself, it would have been great to have Jerry come and help me out. I met Brent not long after this at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ, when Go Ahead was touring during Jerry's coma. He had a Heineken in hand and as he left he took the time to talk to me and my friend at length. I was really impressed. I also always loved his singing. I miss him to this day.

There are a fair ammount of mistakes... most of them due to Brent being incredibly messed-up on something durring the second set. That said, it is also incredibly unique in that it's a Brent-era show without Drums/Space which includes a performance of a pretty rare song. The rest of the show also features some good song choices. I have no complaints other than the performances being a bit... raw. \n\nI actually think this show is pretty essential listening, just becausee it's interesting (for me at least) to see the band dealing with one of its members being on a slightly different track from everyone else. Hell, it's pretty amaazing stuff to see the Rhythm Devils keep up with Brent's constant changes in tempo durring the portion of the show that should technically be theirs.

Bretn knew how to really lay down an atmosphere, a colorful texture, a magic carpet that the band could soar on. His Hammond B-3 work is some of the best I've ever heard from anyone, anywhere, EVER! He had problems and compounded them with alcohol (not a smart move), and other stuff, and he melted down onstage during Maybe You Know (maybe you already know...). Nevertheless, the sound the band had around this time period (early and mid '80s), AND the weird, funky stuff going on with Jerry, Brent,  andBob was surely no angel either, made for some great art. Brent was the real deal. I wish he would have married a more understanding or nurturing or compatible wife... though I don't know her, I have seen the pain a woman can consciously cause a man... (they can be crueler and meaner than men by a long shot!!!), and Brent sang out his blues on stage. Isn't that what we wanted from our artists? REAL pain, REAL emotion?

      "review_text": "Show that legend made infamous <br />The so-called \"Brent meltdown\" show has become a curiosity. There's the backstory of his marriage dissolving and that he gave a drunken performance (though given his progressively worse state there were probably other favors of some sort). When you live the majority of your time on a stage in a band that consumes your entire life, eventually all sides of you will surface on that stage, including tearful emoting from something that bottoms you out. Either way, this particular night is now part of the lore. I imagine he played hungover the next night. But there's more than that going on in this show - in particular, lightning tempos. All of the SBDs run <u>2%+ fast</u> (almost a whole key in places), so you need to run some software BEFORE you can listen to the show objectively. Even then, the tempos are the fastest since '78.\n\nIn '86 Jer was out from July to December (an abscess triggering a diabetic coma will do that - and it's amazing he came back even then) so it's kind of a lost year. But this meme that the mid-80s had no good shows is a patently ridiculous notion. Sure, '86 was no '87 (which was a brilliant year - one of the best), but for top '86 shows check the Cal-Expo shows right after these (I think it's May 3 that's great) and also the New Year's run. So I'm not hashing on '86. \n\nThis is widely known as a 1-star show and it's an example of the band when they're off. But it's also good at illustrating how the band could spin top moments out of nothing. The 3rd of a four-day run, it's the last time they played the Berk high school theater. Given the weirdly brisk tempos, there may have been a lot of bumps backstage, but this Persian meme has gotten out of hand and there's wide misperception about Jer and opiates (\"but I read it on the internet, braaaak!\"). There's no such thing as 'persian' per se, it was just the Dead's inner-circle name for dope - regardless of origin. Maintenance dope users aren't \"in a stupor\". The dope stabilizes and prevents withdrawal - plus a sluggish Jer would have just bumped. This was a year after he cleaned himself up and the band were said to be watching him too closely for that. \n\nFirst Set. Average to below average set. <i>El Paso</i> has fire but Bobby loses his place. On the other extreme, <i>Ramble on Rose</i> clunks and creaks. <i>Let it Grow</i> is a fine example of the band trying hard and bringing things back around. A fine-enough, clean version that saves the set from outright trainwreck.\n\nSecond Set. <i>Touch of Grey</i> is in the uptempo '86 stylee, here even faster, which means it wrecks hard when it goes off the rails. You can hear Bobby trying to save it but Brent's becoming a mess and takes Jerry with him. <i>Estimated</i>  just sounds off, again due to Brent. Jer tries to over-sing him, and it actually smokes from the middle onward. I know of no <i>Eyes</i> faster than this one (even when played back at the right speed). It's worth hearing but at this tempo there's less they can do with it (it's hard for Bobby to do more than single string fretting and doubles stops). The fun is in listening to Jer rise to the challenge with flurries of 16ths. Very few guitarists could have done this! Average but for the uniqueness. The jam-after apparently featured Mickey's Berimbau-ist friend, Jose Lorenzo. However, the drummers don't have chance to do their thang because Brent stays out with them until he veers them into his <i>Maybe You Know</i>. The only one after the 5 in Apr83, it's out of character for the Dead. The song never developed and after this maudlin hiccup it was definitively put to bed. The drummers vamp, befuddled (as Brent ignores any defined rhythm) and the boys must have been wincing, because rather than wait for Drums>Space to emerge, the axemen all run out and Jer launches into a perfect <i>Goin' Down the Road</i>. This is an interesting example of the bright spot that suddenly gelled in the midst of bad shows. Jer just pushes his chips all in and wails. Sometimes it could just all fit together again, as Bobby and Billy are prone to pointing out in interviews. Unfortunately, that's it. <i>Around</i> isn't the least bit tight and by <i>Dough Knees</i> Jer is losing his voice. \n\n<u>1st Set</u>: &nbspD+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: F+\nOverall = 1\u00bd Stars\n\nHighlights:\nGoin Down the Road - One of the best of '86 in the middle of compost! That and the wild, uptempo, gotta-hear-once <i>Eyes</i> are the reason I'm claiming this is more than a one-star show. As far as \"meltdown\", that's probably more legend than accurate descriptor.\n\nSOURCES: I find miller_34765 to be best followed by jeffm_1857 and miller_34766. The SBDs (and the AUDS I've checked) all run like helium  <u>at 2 - 2\u00bd% fast</u>. You can slow the miller_34765 by 2% to hear what the show really sounded like.\n\nIf you offer this as an all-time best, 5-star show then we would like to see your examples of 2 and 3-star shows (n. b. smgarcia, below, says there's no worse show and then gives it 3 stars, apparently reserving 2 stars for the boot of Billy gapping at an interview and 1 star for the tape of Jer's sleep apnea). For the ratings feature to, you know, WORK, there need to be shows like this for there to be 5* shows. That's how the known universe works.",

Set 2 is far more interesting. I actually like what Brent did on Estimated Prophet a lot here, and whatever one might say about his \"meltdown,\" he seemed to shake the others up on a night when they needed it badly (Dew, despite the missed notes near the end, smokes); for that he deserves credit.\n\nAs for the \"meltdown\": it's a bit overplayed. Would that this were the worst public \"meltdown\" in my life. I've had worse in the last 24 hours! And if Weir's allowed to screech at the top of his lungs in an effort to inject a little life into the proceedings, I don't see any reason why Brent shouldn't be allowed to do the same, for whatever reason.\n\nThis is the kind of show that exemplifies the greatness of this band and the uniqueness of this experience. Most bands and artists allow only their \"best\" shows out into the world; The Dead encouraged us to preserve all of theirs. I think The Dead's policy is much more honest and honorable, and I think most of us would agree on that.\n\nBut it's not always going to be comfortable. These guys lived so much of their lives on the road and on stage, after all. In a celebrity-saturated world, we have a tendency to take a \"ho-hum\" attitude toward the latest divorce news.

A reviewer here wrote: \"If we're going to knock Mydland, why not bash Kieth for the late 70s shows where he was so out of it he need a roadie to poke him to stay awake? Why give Jerry a pass on his frequently embarassing and inept showings '94-'95?\"\n\nThe answer to that question, is one that very few Brent fans can empathize with.  The fact of the matter is that people who don't like 80s Dead don't like it, because the very sound of his voice ruins their listening experience.  And the very sound of his keyboards, with the occasional exception of the B3 ruins their listening experience.  He's the wrong guy for the band.  Nobody cares that \"Jerry loved playing with him\".  They care that Jerry and Co broke up a fantastic band by kicking out one of the most beloved members the band ever had (Keith).  I'd rather here a less involved Keith than an over-involved Brent.  His vocals on all of the old songs just ruin it.  It's a travesty.  When you're used to the perfection of the band up until really 1978, at which point they're all off the charts wild and out of sync (not just Keith, though he's been scapegoated by his own people), there's just nothing but resentment to hear the absolute dud they replaced him with.  I understand his voice clicks with some people, but Jerry and Bobby's voice click with all Deadheads.  And that's the great mistake that was made.  They went and involved a man in a legacy of music that was unappealing to at least 50% of the audience, probably more.  This is why 80s shows don't sell as well, and why Dave rarely picks them.  And people take this out on Brent because they pine about what could have been. What if they all went to rehab in '79 and hashed out a real plan, instead of circling the wagons and squeezing out the guy who helped put you on the map throughout the 70s.   And that's really it. Brent is resented for sucking so badly.  They should have taken a year off in '79 and let Keith play his f@#king piano.  Of course he numbed out - Jerry brought a 2nd drummer into the mix and decided to be a crappy rock band instead of the fusion juggernaut they became.  Then Jerry told him he couldn't play piano, he had to play with sustain.  Well (scratching head), Jerry, let me let you in on a little secret (whispering) he's a piano player:)  So...yeah, Brent is maligned because he doesn't hold a candle to his predecessor musically, and his voice is despised by a lot of Grateful Dead fans.",
