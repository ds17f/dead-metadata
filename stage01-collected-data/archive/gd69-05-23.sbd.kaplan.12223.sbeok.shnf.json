This is also one of the peak performances of this year, with an absolutely stellar Dark Star, and also the rest of the Stephen>Eleven>Lovelight medley is outstanding too, with an especially energetic Pigpen on Lovelight. The Morning Dew early in the set is also a very strong keeper rendition, one of the best 69 versions. In short, this is a must have, especially in this sound quality. Get it now.",

The entire unique jam from the 24 surrounding the eleven is great.  But get this one for the Dark Star.  I've loved this show for years, but after listening to it last night, I just had to write a review highlighting this beautiful Dark Star.  4 stars for the excellent quality and good performance, except for that source change in the eleven.",

It doesn't even sound like the same band they are SO much better for this show. Yes it's a short show, is this the whole thing?, but the vulnerability that Bob exhibits on Me And My Uncle parred with the guitar virtuosity of Jerry on Dark Star, more than makes up for the show's brevity. Damn this is some beautiful stuff, I kid you not. The run at the Fillmore West from 2/27 to 3/2 and this show are the best I've heard from 1969.",

Next to 2-13-70, I think it probably has the largest number of memorable unique moments of any pre-Keith Dark Star.  Unlike 2-13-70, almost all of what is happening here appears to be driven by Garcia who is plainly experiencing some sort of 20 minute creative orgasm.  \n\nThe other notable feature  -- and what especially appeals to me -- is the variety of percussion sounds that are heard as the performance progresses.  Awesome.  As in other Dark Stars from this era, the microphones used to capture the castanets, maracas, or whatever small acoustic percussion instruments are used tend to pick up the sound of the guitars which leads, in turn, to a wonderful haze of quintessentially Dead-like feedback and overtones hanging over the entire affair.\n\nThe whole show is excellent (the Eleven ain't anything to write home about) but the Dark Star is extraordinary.",
