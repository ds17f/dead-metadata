      "review_text": "Worcester 10/21/83 My first show, my first time dosed, what can I say...\nSticking to the music,  I am of the opinion that a few shows in 83 rank as the strongest for that decade, even with Garcia's escalating \"persian\" habit. Also, the scene had not yet grown too big so crowd were still peaceful, mostly utilizing psychedelics for transportational purposes. \nHighlights-  I remember a great thundering sound to start it off as I began my own personal blast off. (Phil's lead in to Music Never Stopped)  I already owned Blues for Allah so I knew this one.  Thinking to myself, everyone around me is boogying as hard as they can?  I guess this is what I'm supposed to do.  That's pretty much what I did for the rest of the night.  A very tight first set (most songs are 10-11 minutes long) and a long and spacey scarlet / fire.  The Uncle John's -> Playing also stands out.\nOne point-  someone should upload the Silberman recording of 10/21.  He was one of the 1st to use a digital recorder on tour and had seats in the 4th row!  His recording is absolutely the cleanest modern aud that I have heard so far.  4 stars because there is a better recording.",

      "review_text": "a fiery precocious gem! Who knew! an early 80s show that rocks so hard - and swings so sweet... I guess with the right kind of ears you can hear where the 70s Dead stops kicking so hard and the more twee ethereal 80s dead starts.  \n\nWhay hasn't been mentioned is that the Keys on this show are some sort of wonderful.  There is some seriously smoking fills here, Brent is a legend and is completely underrated in IMHO. \n\nAnyway... brass tacks the playing is spot on here, there are some mike troubles here and there with Bobby dropping out briefly, but generally the mix is tight as Billy's Hi-Hat and Phil lines are as strong and as sweet as they ever got. The sounds quality of this show is crystal and magnificent.  It must be said that there is a certain swagger to the first set, a assured arrogance in the bands playing, perhaps some bolivian friend shook out a generous dose of talc before they took to the stage, who knows... but the 'fcuk you' attitude of CC Rider is downright mean... and they 'messy' guitar solo with overblown reverb in the middle is awesome! Its like your in a ghetto blues bar - and whats more i believe that it was a Bobby solo! (correct me if i'm wrong) thats right folks a Bobby solo that doesn't sounds like choked ice cream van music but actually kicks ass! \n\nThe show gets better and better with each listen... this is some savagely tight playing here! \n\nFinally, i'm working on a vulcan mind meld type of thing - why? - because i want to go to this show and extracting old deadheads memories may be the best way.  Imagine that you can downloading some ones dead show experiences from the net... of course there'd be the normal information - \n\nfor example:  George Bradley, FOB, 3 beers, 100mg California Sunshine, 3 joints, some drop outs in the middle of dark star, cuts out in middle of space when GB went to toilet, encore /parking lot and a girl called Cindy. \n\nanyway i digress... download this show or else the world will be destroyed in two days... you've been warned!",

I've said it before glad I got to see what I did but always felt I missed my favorite years obviously the 77's are great but, I'am really hung up on 80-85 specifically 83-84 that would of been a blast. Anyway I've zeroed in on 83 for years and bottom line on this show from open untill Scarlet>Fire(which I love beginning of this Scarlet) the show smokes and is equal to 15th but after that it does fall apart and get a little weak.The I Need A Miracle stuff sometimes gets a little drawn out and boring and its silly to compare this with post space St. Steven.Jerry was feeling no pain on the 15th cduring space break thats for sure and maybe not enogh here.So in my opinion Crazycatpeekin states the obviouis. Your very lucky to have hit that 83 tour as hard as you did w/your buddy's. I know my friends and I would of been dying at those shows Big Daddy Jerry tearing it up 1983 style. Iam so glad I got to see lots of 89 esp. Alpine 2 years in a row not bad.  \n Double Dose did you hit Popular Creek summer 1983? one time 2-night shot.

But I was just trying to put into perspective the perfection;  (musically, vocally, and energetically) of this particular version.  And truthfully, at least with the many DH I know going back to 71', they agree that this is without question, even for the Dead at their best, way beyond what they would consider possible for the boys. Just listen to it.  And better yet, if you are a musician, transpose it.  It's almost obscene how perfect it is.  Just unusually superb. The rest of the show, however, the band returns to themselves again (and from then on, only to show a very tiny portion of that same magic, in very brief moments.... perhaps in the Spring of 87' and the Summer of 89').  And yes, I truly believe that they reached the summit on this night.  The perfect balance was there.  The 70's had the high energy and element of surprise, but the band still had that \"garage band\" kind of sound, and the musicianship of the band was far more simplistic and \"loose\".  In the 80's, their musicianship and compositional abilities were in full bloom and their sound was clean, refined and \"big\".  Like comparing a 5 piece concerto to a full blown symphony.  During the 83' fall tour (the S/F at the Centrum in particular), the band had the best of both worlds.  The energy, and surprise factor improvisationally (the 70's), and that big refined symphonic sound and serious leap in musicianship (the 80's).  Go backward or forward from that point, and you have one or the other, but not both.  But don't get me wrong, I love and enjoy ALL the shows. So, enough of my rambling.",

I was drawn to these comments of this show\nmade by BigMallardDuck:\n\n \"On that night during that pair of songs, the Grateful Dead reached their highest peak...  Truly, it would all be gradually downhill from that night and those two songs onward. Trust me, I witnessed it first hand. \nIn all honesty, once you listen to this Scarlet/Fire a few times, you will get very spoiled, and no other version will do. This (at least among those who have spanned the decades) is pretty much common knowledge and without dispute. \"\n\n  So, if I understand correctly, precisely at\nthat moment the Dead peaked, and it was ALL\ndownhill from there? No other version will do???\nAnd this is common knowledge and WITHOUT  DISPUTE?\n\n  Bizarre. As for common knowledge, I've been\na Deadhead since 1973, talked with thousands of\nother Deadheads and I've never heard anyone echo\nthis opinion. Nor would any Deadhead I've ever\nmet say their opinion of a show is \"without\ndispute.\"\n We can \"trust you\" because you witnessed it first\nhand? Uh, what about the other 10,000 at this show, and the untold thousands that have listened\nto it since?\n\n  Phew? Scary stuff. Must be something wrong with\nme, 'cos I listened to this show then went back to\nan old University of Alabama show from the '70s and, oddly, was still able to enjoy it.\n \n By your logic anyone listening to this show would\nnever be able to listen to any other Dead ever again. The whole scene would collapse and the world would consist of musical zombies listening to infinite iterations of this Scarlet/Fire!\n\n  Or maybe you were just kiddin'.....",

      "review_text": "It's an OK, mechanical Scarlet/Fire Sorry, bu I disagree with most of Mallard's comments.  I got on the bus in early 70 at the Fillmore East, with a bunch of friends, and i don't think any of us would put this Scarlet/Fire anywhere near the top.  Phil sounds bored and uninterested, Jerry sounds mechanical, and there is no real interaction between Jerry and Brent--they might mimmick eachother here and there, but they don't build off eachother at all and they never really mesh.  Jerry has more than a few off notes in Scarlet and the jam is rather uninspiring and repetitive, wihtout changes in accent, attack, or intonation in the repeated riffs. The transition to Fire is hardly a transition. Sure there are some quick riffs, and some intersting ones, but not that many truly unique and interesting ones.  I am a musician, this just ins't that interesting to me musically either.\n\nI'd take most decent 76 or 77 Scarlet/Fires over this.  I'd even prefer an 80, say Fox 11-30 just as an example.\n\nI think late 70s sound was usually much bigger than mid 80s. 77 is about as far from a garage band as you can get--they are improvisational together as a unit in ways mechanically precise non-garage bands could never be. By 82 they got into more of a shuffle and while sometimes mechanically more precise, I never went to a show with the hope of hearing something mechanically precise.  Much of the 80s sound like a band trying to put together repeatable decent formula performances, with some train wrecks and a few very nice shows here and there.\n\nThe rest of this show has a few nice parts, but does start to fall apart seriously after Scarlet/Fire",

      "review_text": "Another perspective I get a kick out of reading reviews on this site.  As varied as the subject matter.\n\nI saw my first show on New Year's 1980 (far too dosed, I might add) and saw 59 more of them - most in 81, 82, 83 - before my last show in 1988.  I saw the Greeks in 81 and 82, the Hult shows in Eugene in 84, six New Year's shows, the Aladdin Hotel in Vegas (81 and 83), Warfield, Golden Hall, and, well, too many to list here.  I was a hardcore tape collector (1200+ tapes at last count - about 20 years ago!) with an always busy \"tape exchange\" and direct connections on the east and west coast.  I knew every riff, every solo, every mistake, every breakout, every anything during those years.  \n\nAnyway my point is that at each of these shows somebody felt they saw \"it\", and they most surely did.  Almost every tape I made for somebody had \"it\" somewhere on it.  The live Dead experience is entirely personal and based on infinite stimuli.  There is a certain element of futility attached to the whole excercise, although it does provide a fantastic perspective on the whole affair.\n\nFor what it's worth, I like this Scarlet-Fire and remember when the tapes arrived liking it from the get go.  Peak? End all be all? Best ever? Mechanical? Yes! No!  It simply is whatever you hear and whatever you feel, end of story!\n\nPersonally I LOVE the Scarlet-Fire from 12-26-81...I like the ambience of the audience tapes, the energy that night (first night of an excellent run IMO), but not sure there are ten people out there who would agree.  There are better according to all criteria, but that one I LIKE.  So be it!",
