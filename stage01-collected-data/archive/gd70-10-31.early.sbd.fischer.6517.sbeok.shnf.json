You need to get out more. This show is at best average and at worst dull and dreary. 1970 has some of the finest moments the band ever had but for me, this show is right down in the bottom half of the shows of the year. Nothing is especially terrible but when you compare this with the Fillmore East shows just over a month earlier or the Capitol Theater shows a week later you can see how uninteresting this. It's totally unremarkable. The Viola Lee> Cumberland> Uncle John promises a lot but is a let down.\n\nPlease - give ratings that actually reflect the quality of the show in the context of other shows from the same time period.",

If it were a volume issue, just like the week before with the Allman Bros (see, I was there and know), it was hardly an all night theme of the bands being pissed off.  After all, the Dead were there in 67 & 68 (before my time) as well as the Allmans playing there 5x over two years.  Now, back to the show.  It was a fucking lysergic weekend with thousands of heads descending upon campus (from sister schools in Albany, Buffalo, as well as other schools in the NE Boston, New Haven etc).  And lest I forget, the shit head townies from nearby Three Villages, etc.  What a fucking weekend.  And as I said, you had to be there.  Half of you fuckers weren't even protoplasm in your old mans' balls when this went down. Fucking townies broke into the Deads' hotel room and ripped of all of their $$$, but that didn't deter them from giving us a weekend (4 shows to remember). I worked three of the shows (security) and had 3rd row seats, right in front of Garcias' pedal steel (Riders set),  Micky was fucking scary, in his wool black hat against that black curtain backdrop.  Pig in a gold lame' turban, Bobby's a fucking 18 yo. kid forChristsake.  Till the Morning Comes, UJB, Stephen, the last fucking Viola Lee.  Just keep hatin on the Dead, and wax about how great Dead & Coi is all about vis a vis Country Dead circa 1970.  Sure, it isn't Harpur, it isn't the FE 2/13 or 9/19, but it happened and it was fucking good.  This is for you Fancy Nancy, wherever you may be.",

Lots and lots of mistakes, Jerry of all people.  (he also plays some great shit, obviously, but lots of \"clams\").  Mickey, maybe happy to be back on Long Island, is in good form....maybe too good, I feel like he overplays on the first show.  However the drums in \"The Other One\" are fantastic.  \"Smokestack Lightning\" is also good.  \n\nThe Dead seem a little bored with their rep also around this time, and try out different songs (Dark Hollow electrically) and try bringing back old ones (Viola Lee Blues, which has a real \"couldn't give a fuck\" vibe to it until it veers off into \"Cumberland Blues\", the song they'd rather be playing.  They do \"the Other One\" with a nice long Drums....then a couple of songs later they're playing \"Good Lovin'\" with an EVEN LONGER Drums (that's not as nice!).  Most of \"Good Lovin'\" IS the drums!\n\nI mean, when Pigpen suddenly gets THREE songs in a row (Big Boss Man, Hard To Handle and Good Lovin')....and one of them is a repeat from the afternoon show (Hard To Handle)....you know something's up! (incidentally the first show's \"Hard To Handle\" seems to these ears as the \"better\" version).\n\nJerry talked about getting his playing down to where you can hear his \"mood\".....if I'm reading his mood right on this one, it's \"I don't give a fuck\".\n\nNow the CROWD seems to be having a ball!  Which is what Deadheads do!  Just because the tape isn't Harpur College doesn't mean the crowd didn't enjoy themselves!  Hell, that's the story of many a Dead show, right?",
