Very much a mid eighties drive with a mid/late 70's groove.  A must have for sure.  Thank You to whomever is shooting all the great gd stuff up on the archive.

Since I was one yr old in '71 I couldn't be there but gave it a 5 because it is sooo hot. This one is a 94 out of 100 on the sound quality, just makes A category for me. So it gets a 4. Enjoy it!\n\nNot the \"hottest\" Scarlet>fire in my opion but so well played and very long! Doesn't beat 7-7-78 nor does it beat cornell but it is up there with the barcelona '81 and the scarlet fire from UVM in 4-13-83. If you like those shows, you must download this show.

This show is hot, has a great setlist, and  was recorded on the day I was born (I'm a deadhead born too late) at a venue a couple blocks from my apartment.  Can still hear this one whirling down the street in Chicago.\n\nThe first set rocks from top to bottom, only taking a break for a beautiful Roses.  One of the better electric FODs I've heard.\n\nThe first half of the second set (Sarlet > Fire > Estimated > Eyes) is bliss.\n\nSound is a tad hissy, but I like the mix - get's better as the show progresses too.\n\nI'm partial to the 80s, and this is one of the best I've heard.

The Scarlet>Fire is sublime, Jerry finds a zone during the 2d jam of Fire that will leave your tongue wagging.  The Estimated is long and funky, the Eyes, I found a bit short and fast for my taste.

Again, I would strongly recommend all three nights, not only for their musicianship, but the sound quality is as good as it gets.\n\nEnjoy.",

Sharp quality sound, but you can't hear the opening ascending thematic licks at all.  At 3:59 Garcia starts his first run, and he ends it by dropping off.  Sometimes silence is compelling, but here, it flows over into the start of his second run, and it seems he's just lost his way.  His third starts at 4:56 but there's no moving over to chords, and then its on to the Wind In The Willows verse.  Pretty stark contrast with, say, 2/3/79.  \n\nThe jam starts around 5:50.  Interestingly, he restates the theme at 6:59.  He turns on the wah at 7:56.  At 9:53 he stutters, and I'm thinking, where is Lesh?  By 10:45, I'm wondering, where the heck is everyone?  He tries the theme again at 11, back to the wah at 12, and it's on to Fire.\n\nInteresting, but....",

Unfortunately my opinion is unchanged: this is a mostly mediocre show, largely due to Jerry's scattershot lead playing.  The sound quality is crystal clear and there are some nice moments (esp. Wharf Rat) but with all the wonderful shows available here on archive I can't recommend this one.  If you're looking for a show from this era to add to your collection may I suggest 3/9/81?

      "review_text": "Sure what the heck, I'll overrate it This is a nice typical '81 show with great board quality - 5 sound; 4.5 show. I have to chuckle when someone doesn't like a show and feels they must suggest a \"superior\" show. Well, thats all well and good; its always nice to get someone elses opinion on other shows they like (thats why we read these things), but lets be realistic. The great thing about the Dead was their chameleon ability to play different types of music and make it their own....space, R&B, Motown, country, bluegrass, etc.... Flubs, spotty vocals, etc, were all part of the experience and sometimes turned out to be a gas (check out Brokedown - Nassau 5/9/81... hee hee). That \"flub\" made that particular show quite memorable; aside from my brakes giving out on the way home. What may be a great show to one person, may not be to another. Dosemeister, write a review of the MSG 3/29/81 show so I can see what you personally liked about it; the only reviews I see from you are 2/3 stars; and thats okay so long as you're consistent(just the equivelant of the russian judge in gymnastics ;-) ) Most of the shows I review I overrate by some standards, but thats okay too...I'm consistent in what I like. We're all different, some folks like clarity of boards, others like the reminiscent sound of an audience tape. Remember folks, let not stomp on a 7 minute Ramble on Rose only because we like the 25 minute Scarlet/Fire. A good plan is to find someones comments you like for a particular favorite show and see what else they like...chances are you may like the same types of shows. The Uptown was a really cool venue; I miss those places and days. I'm now an \"old\" man that loved every show I saw or heard for one reason or another.\nSigned, A former dayglow freak who used to paint the face, then joined the human race.",

But that bias helps me get turned on to other shows  I might ordinarily miss.  I have a lot of '81 on tape.  Saw my first show in '81 (Rainbow 3/21).  I do love my '81 (Long Beach Arena Shakedown anyone?)  And this is another one for the books.  All you early 80's cat just keep on doing what you're doing so I don't spend the rest of my life in 1972, '76 and '89.  \n\nI won't over-rate this one.  It's just fine although I'm not a huge fan of how the SBD sounds.  True for a few early 80's SBD's in my collection.  Yeah I'm just another picky Deadhead.",

      "review_text": "Great show - Classic era I have enjoyed these 3 shows for a long time.  \n\nI think late 79- 81 should be considered one of the pinnacle eras, along with 72-73 and 77-78 etc.  They were totally pro in this era, tight and focused with a revamped repertoire (sans DS and Stephen, though).  But they did some great shows in this era.\n\nEach member also seemed to bringing his best sound at this time, too, I think.  Bobby had that squeaky thing perfected (before going into the constant super-fuzz distortion in the late 80s and beyond).  Jerry has this crunchy soaring lead tone that he uses.  I love Brents sound from this early 80s era, too. he has the ploinky thing as well as the big tone of the B3 happening, and his harmonies were so great.  I am a Brent fan.  And all their sounds merged so well together.\n\nThis show in particular is great:  Upbeat 1st set and the 2nd set smokes through and through.  I am especially fond of the Scar -> fire -> estimated -> eyes.  That is a cool run, for sure.  The leads in the middle of Scarlet are fantastic, and the transitional jam into Fire is also really good.  Though I agree with the earlier reviewer that Eyes is a bit short and too fast.  But still, what a sweet run of monster tunes to start the 2nd Set.\n\nThe jamming throughout is really edgy and the JG guitar tone is crunchy and great.  The lead at the end of Wharf Rat is a knockout. \n\nI really like this show, and this whole run of shows illustrates the band at this time really well.\n\n4 stars / Great stuff.  \n\nI give it 4 and not 5 because of the sound.  I think, for this era, this is among the best sounding shows around, but overall these shows weren't captured and presented as well as the Betty Board stuff.  Cassette factor?  There just isnt the clarity on the high end that you get from a crispy 77 SBD.  Its hard to hear the high hats and cymbals, and the kick drums / Phil are not as clearly cutting through the mix in these SBDs as they do in the earlier stuff.  (It gets worse in 82, but its bad enough here.)\n\nWorth the time to listen to these shows.  This is great stuff from one of my favorite eras.",

There's very few shows I can think of that are a waste of time to check out. I know what you mean about Bobbys Super-fuzz distortion in the late 80's. The thing of it is Bobbys ears are so good that he knew that distorted guitar tones would combine perfectly in constrast with the ultra-clean sounds coming from the other instruments. It's almost like the mentality of an abstract painter finding the balance between beauty and ugliness in his painting. It's difficult to say what they would have sounded like with a 'squeky' guitar tone in the late 80's.I'm sorry if I give high marks for most shows. what can I say, they where mostly on and totally outstanding on just about any given night. 4.0 for sound quality",

I think I must've not had the volume loud enough first time, because everything came through as solid jamming the 2nd time. I didn't take notes, but remember a particularly strong start, and some particularly nice Bob freak-outs on C.C. Rider. Again, generally every song played really well.\n\n---- Original Review\nI didn't find this show to be all that great, though perhaps I was influenced by the other negative review? Another caveat is that I didn't have a chance to give it the \"full listen\", which for me is lying down, eyes closed, head phones on. I never really have time for that, though I should make it more often. These days, it's pretty much while driving, doing house work, walk break at lunch, etc.\n\nIt's not that anything was particularly bad, but I didn't find much really exciting, or compelling. It mostly felt pretty uneventful. \n\nFirst set (less fresh on my mind) had some really nice singing, but felt mostly uneventful. Friend of the Devil and Cassidy come to mind as having been nice.\n\nSecond got off to a weak start with Scarlet Begonias, usually one of my favorites. Sequeue into fire on the mountain, fire on the mountatin had some nice jams. Things seemed to seemed to pick up from post Estimated jam. I liked the fast Eyes of the World, and Drums notably good - one of my favorites. Wharf Rat one of the best, for sure.\n\nI liked 5/16/81 alot better, and recall parts that REALLY stood out as inspired/excited. I'm also excited to check out 3/9/81 (just started it, Stranger sounds good, but I LOVE this song).",

The boys find their energy after a bit clunky start to Scarlet in the 2nd set, and continue with a roaring Fire. The fire leads into a nice estimated which transitions slightly less than smoothly into a gorgeous but short Eyes. Drums>Space is one of the better ones, but the energy seems to leave afterwards. Wharf Rat is decent, but I did not seem to appreciate it as much as the other reviewers. Even Sugar Mag, which usually holds up pretty well energy-wise, seems a bit lagging. \n\nNo Don't Ease Encore, but it's just as well. I never liked that song as an encore. Plus, with their energy a bit low, I can't imagine it would be anything worth listening to.",

The sound is perfect, but the main problem is that I can\u2019t hear bass clearly, vocals are too much in front. \n\nThen, first set is short and has no something interesting. \u201cNew Minglewood Blues\u201d is nice, but it\u2019s not as aggressive, as versions of 1977 (San Bernardino, Barton Hall). \u201cFriend\u201d and \u201cCassidy\u201d are cold, it\u2019s only technique, so the songs remained half-spoken to my mind, they are not alive. \u201cEyes of the World\u201d is awful. Guys started it too fast, Jerry\u2019s not singing, he\u2019s trying to follow the music in time. Leads between the verses are weak, they don\u2019t touch you at all, it\u2019s just like cacophony. \u201cNFA\u201d is out of energy, poor performance, though Jerry\u2019s nice at some moments\n\nThe only composition which deserves 5 stars is \u201cS>F\u201d, and because of that I give this show such a high grade. Jamming is nice, singing is nice, definitely the best part of the concert, GD on its high level",

I am no more impressed now than I was sitting in the first row of the balcony all 3 nights.  I was really expecting something great after the 1980 shows at this fine venue.  These were the first shows I ever flew to, and stayed at nice hotels.  Sadly, the music was decent but nothing really spectacular.  I do remember getting seriously harrassed on the way in.  The door guards were shaking everyone down for drugs and putting everything in trash cans.  While they took me aside for further harrassment, I couldn't help but notice that there was also a crew eagerly going through the cans and picking out the good stuff for their own enjoyment.  Being young and STUPID I questioned them on this, their reply was simply \"do you want to go to jail, or go in and see the show?\"  Thats Chicago for you!  I also remember the distinct fear that the whole balcony was coming down under the weight of all those dancing kids.  It was shaking so bad I got a little seasick!",

FOTD is followed by solid versions of classics, Cassidy and Loser. Then, of course for Chitown, some blues with C. C. Rider. Played more than any other year in '81 (32x), song was first covered in '79 and last played in '92. Really nice Roses, followed by Minglewood closer! Curious Minglewood closer, but as doug the dude puts it, this is really priming things for set 2.\n\nHuge third quarter features a great scarlet->fire and estimated->eyes combo (totaling approx. 45 mins). Speedy '81 eyes does not disappoint! Neither does the scarlet-fire, which very well might be the best yet played at the Uptown. Fourth quarter features 20 mins of drums/space, followed by fairly standard finale: NFA->Wharf Rat->Sugar Magnolia. Some weird stuff going on near end of drums. \"Hello! Hi...Is that a horse?!\"  Encore is missing, but i'm sure the Don't Ease was a short, sweet treat to close out this solid second night from the '81 Uptown run.",
