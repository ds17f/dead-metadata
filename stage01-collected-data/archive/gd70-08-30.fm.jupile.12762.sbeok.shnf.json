One of the reasons I love the Grateful Dead so much is the sheer power the band displays during this time frame- and this clip really captures it.  In this Easy Wind, Pigpen takes off like a person who just busted out of jail, but the rest of the band sure catches up to him, once the Jam sequence fires up and the studio starts rockin'.  Vintage stuff here.  As we say, GOOD Ol' GRATEFUL DEAD- come and get it.",

The earlier versions from 1970 all have a double-time delivery that gave the new song a folk-ish country feel. This is the first one that has the Grateful Dead stamped all over it, and they kept it until the end.\n\nLP",

Infact I've heard better recorded shows done by the roadies than this KQED show. \n\n~Classic 1970 Sound/Performance.\n\nI recommend adding this show to your 1970 GRATEFUL DEAD collection. \n\nHere's one way to download/stream this show in \"crappy\" MP3:\n\nThe IA recommends users of Windows XP view this web-page with RealPlayer. \n\nRealPlayer is a free media player you can download at www.realplayer.com. \n\nUsing RealPlayer to view this webpage, click the VBR M3U link to open the songs in the Playlist.\n\nIf your Playlist is not open, open it by clicking the Playlist icon at the lower right hand corner of RealPlayer. \n\nOnce the songs are in the Playlist, double click the song to play it, then click the record button at the lower left hand corner of Realplayer to record it. \n\nWhen the red line reaches the other end click the stop button to download the song. Your song is in the RealPlayer Downloads folder. \n\nRepeat these steps for each song.\n\nOR \n\nTake the \"audio out\" of the \"headphone jack\" on your computer and hook it up to the \"input\" on your Reel-to-Reel, Cassette, Beta-Max, VHS, CD, DVD, MP3 recorder and record it in real time....duh?\n\nI recommend using your EQ during playback of most of the shows on the IA, this one included.\n\nWindows Media Player has a 10 band EQ and SRS WOW effects that enhance the sound.\n\nEat, Drink, Be Merry and Listen to the GRATEFUL DEAD if you can, if you can't...TFB.\n\nThanks for the LOVE from 1970.\n\nAIRBORNE \"DEATH FROM ABOVE\" Viet Nam 1970.\n\nPS: you'd think these shows would be in higher quality formats coming from San Francisco, right next to silicon valley, but apparently snot.",

I could live with that if the performances were really good, but the truth is, they're not. You can find much better (in sound and jam quality) from 1970 (in my opinion the Dead's greatest year) on the archive.",

The idea was you have 2 receivers, 4 speakers and you could get quad. The problem with this is the sound really hasn't been divided up properly and is waffling around. Still a very good vintage piece.",
