At about the 3/4 mark in Alligator, during a tentative exploratory part of the jam, Garcia casually invents the Dickey Betts vocabulary and goes on to develop it further in the Other One. Potato Caboose is sublime with an incredible transition into Cross Eyed. Or the point that China Cat kicks into overdrive and rages until a seamless segue into a boiling Eleven. \nVery good audio quality for early '68 despite some gaps and splices.\nYou need this one.",

Maybe its because this show is the second night of their first Northwest tour, but they really have fun with this Alligator. The vocals are mixed weak on the Dark Star and after Jerry 'opens the door' to the Spanish Jam, I think he finds he has little to say on this night except when he mirrors the\nDuane Allman riffs, which is always a cool thing. \n   I tend to reserve the 5 star rating for only the most excellent shows with excellent sound quality, like 3/2/69. This would be a 4 except for the weak vocals in the mix and some parts of the jam that did not become the color the boys intended. Still, its worth having.",

What a surprise to experience this!  I remember wanting to applaud after every tune, but the \"music never stopped\" and I thought that this was so odd.  The feedback was a trip!  We sat for quite awhile not sure if the show was over or not, and then the feedback would start up again.  This show forever established in my 16 year-old mind what SF psychedlic music should sound like, right down to how the Dead played to the ambiance of the hall.  When \"Anthem\" was released later in the year, I memorized the entire record.  I can still play the whole thing back in my mind.  Now that's some kind of magic!",

The one from Tahoe 2/23 (Dick's 22), though nearly as long, never rises even close to these heights of energy & color.  This leads nicely into Dark Star.  Far-out effect on Jerry's voice.  Great setlist, they've got all their early psychedelic pieces in place at this point, but as someone said below, they're still a garage band--so it's fun as well as intense.\nPigpen's organ is a fully equal musical voice in these days, no \"laying out\" here--he even participates in the final Feedback. Love it.  \n\nGreat 16-minute Alligator to open!, and, rarely, they visit all the parts heard on Anthem (by Tahoe, they weren't vocalizing the \"Alligator!\" chorus anymore).\n\nThese early Other One lyrics are funny; just as acid-oriented, but more over-obviously so (\"...my head was not in sight/I would ask the walls about it, but they vanished overnite\").  The changes were a good thing, I think.\n\nMy only lament is not having the complete Born Cross-eyed or Caution, which on my copy both have their middle sections spliced out.  Especially too bad on the Caution, since what's here sounds so great; I'm guessing there was a full vocal by Pigpen in actuality.  But we enjoy what we have, and are grateful~ classic stuff.  Even Feedback is engaging from start to finish.\n\nSolar Jeremy, you're a lucky man.  Thanks for sharing, it's always a special treat to encounter the people who were the audience at these mythical shows, especially when you can remember it so clearly AND are still on the bus.....!\n\nSound quality is quite good, slightly bassy but all instruments are heard clearly.",

      "review_text": "The free-form parts of this show are the most inspired I\u2019ve listened to every show that Archive offers from 1965 to this show, and this one is just not as good as many of them here. It\u2019s not as smooth, tight, or energetic as other shows from this month or these few months. A lot of sloppy vocals, and the jamming has some nice bits, the transitions aren\u2019t as good as in other shows.\n\nAlligator doesn\u2019t have the energy of others from this period. (Check out the Alligator of 67-08-05 here at Archive.org, for instance.)\n\nWhat is called Space here is actually an introspective Spanish Jam prelude \u2013 inventive, and one of the places where the band is playing its best in this show. This and the Spanish Jam, as well as the final feedback, are the most inspired parts of the show.\n\nJerry delivers weak vocals on Dark star and China Cat compared to others of this time (such as 1/17/68). Dark Star was only a couple of months old at this point. China Cat and The Eleven were five days old. Jerry stops playing for a bit at the beginning of the Eleven. Sloppy entrance of vocals. The Eleven seems to get stuck in several places, and the transition into Caution is not as smooth as others of this period.\n\nFeedback fans will like the finale of the show, which starts with wild psychedelia, fades to nothing, and rises from the Dead, so to speak. Another show highlight.\n\nAll things are relative: this show is still 4 stars because of spots of brilliance, and is miles above some of the really bad performances of the late 1980\u2019s and 1990s (and even some klunkers in the \u201870\u2019s). Definitely worth a listen, but check out some of the other offerings from the Anthem era. (Don\u2019t forget the fall 1967 shows.) Try also the excellent Dick\u2019s Picks Volume 22, 2/23/68, Kings Beach Lake Tahoe.",

Though it doesnt quite reach the dizzying heights of 1/20, this show is very special nonetheless! \n\nAnother en-suite masterpiece, with pretty much non-stop intensity from the opening notes of the mind-blowing Alligator through Caution. The segues are all extremely well jammed as the band is clearly on the same roll as the previous performance. This phenomenal show is certainly a top ten of 1968!",

I mean I hear his organ & he's destroying this recording(in a good way) but unless that guys grunting and telling people to \"Get your hands out of your pockets!\" then I'm not hearing Pig doing his thing, you know what I mean? Bobby on the other hand- woo hoo, I think somebody better get him a bucket o water, cause that sh@t's on fire. He really surprises me when I listen closely-Pig too, he's truckin' along keeping it together- but imagine if he'd been an acid freak like the rest of 'em? The guy might have played differently-don't know. \nBeing partial to the guitar thing, being a guitarist as I am, Jerry is a worker and he's always working to find a new note to put into the strangest spots. Phil & Bill(sounds funny) have an odd rhythmical connection, unusual and perhaps more innovative than many realize-I think they function best when they don't listen to each other-maybe that's the wrong way to put it-they certainly have a better connection when Bill keeps out of Phil's busy busy bass like during Caution, they just gel back together around 3:00min in, before that they were kind of dancing around each other but never quite solidifying- whatever you call it- they're brilliant on this fine evening in January 1968. I guess from here on the Jams become somewhat like a blizzard and crazy like a tempest. The feedback, for me, can be nothing less than the most profound way to communicate any idea, image, or information, because the chaos bleeds right through my brain something like a cross between a thousand trains all pulling into the station at once, nails on a chalk board & the echo of some planet in our solar system being destroyed- and the analogies are endless I'm sure.",

      "review_text": "My Favorite Alligator Or one of my favorites. Mickey playing conga drums, Jerry soaring beautifully. Those Alligators that played by themselves without going into Caution were sublime. See 5/5/67, 8/5/67 and 9/3/67 and you'll see what I mean. Someone mentioned Cipollina and Betts earlier. I hear Santana. Maybe it's just cause of the conga drums but Jerry's solo on New Potato Caboose reminds me of Se Acabo. Oh and by the way, I used to consider this the weakest New Potato. Not anymore. It's been considerably upgraded. That's It For The Other One is ok. Nothing to write home about. The usual garage band solos from Garcia long before those drum solos. I had to laugh at Bobby's early lyrics though. \"I could not think or spell my name or fly. There was no way.\" Uh ha ha ha. What? I don't really care if the middle of Born Cross-Eyed is missing. Nothing beats the studio version. The live versions are always slop-minster. The Spanish Jam is very stylish. Let's see. Been about a year since I heard the show and I have yet to listen to the rest of it. As I recall, it's not as good as the first six songs but the Feedback is worth listening too. I remember that much. 5 stars for the most original Alligator I've ever heard. Otherwise it would get 3 stars.",
