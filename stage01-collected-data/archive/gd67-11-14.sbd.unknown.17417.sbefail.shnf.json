Both of these started in the studio, before they started performing them, which was unusual even for this time. (There were a couple of tracks on the first album that they played in the studio, like the Golden Road, but they soon dropped them from shows.)\n\nBorn Cross-Eyed is much as it is on Anthem, but this Dark Star is utterly unique, and quite nice. I wonder how much that single would sell for now.",

Whoever remixed (I imagine Phil, as it is SO psycedelic) did a phenominal job. Adding in T.C.s Keyboards, about 15 tracks of Jerry singing (trippe OUT) some acid inspiration at the end, ad a 5 scond banjo outro. Now THAT is the Darkstar for the ages. The PERFECT studio version. WAY worth the 99 cents!!!!",

The version here is FANTASTIC!\n\nThe Dark Star on the hit's package (which is also hidden on the 2001 re-issue of Live Dead after We Bid You Goodnight) is a full studio effort, with Pig's 8-note organ riff on it. This version also includes the banjo outro, with Jerry reading spoken word over it. (Haven't heard the remix that \u2018crashes\u2019 mentioned, but I will check it out).\n\nAll in all, 5 for the sound quality, the songs, and for primal dead at it peak.",
