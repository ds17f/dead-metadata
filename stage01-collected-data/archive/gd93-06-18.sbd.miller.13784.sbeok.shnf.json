Had 30 minutes to decide whether or not to drive to Chicago from Little Rock, Arkansas.  No brainer.  Show would have been surreal even without the help, and it was an experience that I will never forget.  Maybe some hardcore Heads will poo-poo something about the show, but that will never change the experience for me.  I remember the storm coming in and the clouds spilling over into the stadium to the right of the band, and natures light show.  Also at intermission they put the NBA Finals game between Chicago and Phoenix on the big screens.  My first time to chicago, and I will never forget it.  Also Sting opened, but no one seemed to care. I have goosebumps writing this as I listen.  Thanks to whoever put this out there for us.",

      "review_text": "Hometown Shows Being from Chicago it was always a treat to have the Boys playing \"Downtown\".  The priceless looks on many faces - tourists, locals, ect - from seeing so many heads doing their thing whatever it was in such a peaceful one-love manner turned alot of people on to what the dead was all about - THE MUSIC.  Soldier Field was a wonderful location with the parks and the lake to explore when you wanted to wander before and after the show, and the shakedown street vending area was always on fire with plenty of Merch.  Sting opening had the crowd in a grove and the dead did what they do when they came through - providing a concert experience by putting on a quality show.  Soldier Field was no Alpine Valley but had it own personality as a venue, and with the skyline and sights looking from the field alone boosts the rating.  Put in huge crowd of 50,000 and sound that would be set up to bounce around all around you who could ask for more.  I may have a biased opionion from being a Chicago head, but seeing over 100 shows Soldier Field was always a good quality experience and quality show.  Worth the download.  Music 4.  Venue 5.

Thanks for the long strange trip guys, you added volumnes of bliss to my life!\n\nI remember how much the Hell scared the shit out of me.  First show, ate waayy tooo much!!! Sugaree calmed me down, what a nice jam.  Then back into strangeville for Walkin blues, not a fan of any of the slide stuff. Stagger lee was a nice little treat.  So wierd to be listing to this little folksy song in this big ampitheater.  Then they kicked it up w/ Queen Jane, Bobby's best song of this era IMHO, followed by two of my favorite songs row and music.  The second set was classic dead and we jammed like I have never before.  This is when I started to finally relax and I felt emotions that I had never felt before.  Just so much inter connection between so many people in one space.  I was in a spirital place that forever changed my life.  I remember the storm comming in and the Watchtower as the band met the storm with as much energy as it had. China was just very cool to see little jerry on stage with the spot on him and 50,000 people quitely listning to him poor his heart out.  He had an ability to connect with every single person in an audiance at once.  He opened himself up to us and let us lead him.  There was some telepathic energy floating back and forth, you know what I am talking about...  The encore was a let down and the begining of the freakout that was leaving Soldiers and back into the city.  Luckly the lot scene was always nice in Chi-town.  Thanks guys and thanks all you other kind souls who helped make my first show life altering.",

It brings back fond memories of a beautiful night.  \n\nI remembered this being a fun, interesting performance, and well -- I was right.  While this isn't one of those seventies shows where they can flat-out do no wrong from the first note to the last, there's an awful lot of very good playing here.  Some of it is notably generous, too, with some great jams within and out of the ends of the first set songs.  It's one of those shows where the set list might look pretty much standard-issue, but it's worth a listen.  \n\nAnyway, four stars for its era.  If there's a tape floating around of the Sting show that opened, that's probably be worth a listen, too.  I remember he was very good.  Jerry sat in on \"Tea in the Sahara\" or something like that.",

The cassette seems tio be made from the same source found here.\n\nThis show took place at the place where the long strange trip ended, although this one is from the 1993 tour rather than the 1995 tour.  It is a highly uneven show.  Some of it is horrible--- especially the appallingly offkey rendition of \"Box of Rain\" and the aimless 20 minute Drums->Space. (I heard tracks marked Tunings which were more coherent than this Drums->Space.) Some of it is transcendent, especially the medley of mostly old tunes towards the end of the set.  The fans cheer everything the guys do: good, bad or indifferent it is all greeted by waves of ecstatic screaming.  It's amazing the band could play at all with all that racket going on in front of them.\n\nThe show ends with the relatively obscure anthem \"Liberty\": I am surprised that no present-day country rockers have gotten around to covering this American classic.\n\nAll in all, well worth listening to.  Even the bad stretches are bad in an interesting way.  I am just glad this is a soundboard dub.",

Luckily I met a hot ass hippie who braided my hair called me a virgin tweeker. She saved my trip and brought me back from the depths of doom. I was 16 and I remember not really knowing about them yet but my cousin who was a few years older convinced me to go. We had tickets but were 3 rows away from being the very last row. I only wish I understood the magnitude of what I was experiencing. Saw them a year later and the year after for the last show.  Sadly I think the first show I saw was the best.  Been to several Phish shows but as good as they are they just don't compare.  The music, the people, the band were just from a time that sadly doesn't exist anymore.  Glad I could revisit 20 years later. At least I'm enjoying the ride.",

Anyway this show was absolutly magical even with the storm....  The clouds were low and the rain was falling...  The lighting guys were shinning the lights up on the low riding clouds.. A giant pillowy projector screen...  \nI remember we were sitting at the lower level near the wall back of the stadium with Sears Tower clearly in behind the stage...  My buddy Jason say man it be cool to see lightning hit one of those buildings.... and BAM a lightning bolt struck the sears tower lightning rod on top of the building!  WOW!!!  Maybe why they chose to play smokestack lightning the next night?  Who knows... anyway back to this show!  During Uncle Johns a lightning bolt came from behind the stage horizontal above the stadium just before the verse they say \"God Dam I declare have you seen the light\" The Video screens showed Bobby and Jerry Looking at each other YELLING \"GOD DAM I DECLARE HAVE YOU SEEN THE LIGHT\" The entire stadium reacted back with a resounding YESSSSSS....

I felt the 1st set too short, but really impressed with the 2 new songs introduced over the two night stand, had been played less than ten times live, I'm sure. \n1st set. Simply amazing. Garcia's solos in Stagger Lee, Queen Jane, Row Jimmy and TMNS are some of the best I've heard. I actually feel that these songs were performed better here in Chicago than the performances at Alpine '89. Blasphemous, I know but play them back to back and compare; there's little doubt.\n    Magical china doll, elevating. 5 for fidelity and 4 for performance.\nOhh yeah!

You might call this the Indian summer of the Grateful Dead. As the modern deadhead points out, summer 93 shouldn't be lumped into \"the end.\" Lots of really good stuff to be found, though as he adds, by the following September \"the early signs of decline were more noticeable.\" Read more: http://moderndeadhead.blogspot.com/2011/01/grateful-dead-summer-1993.html. \n\nHighlights include a sweet first set (second song) Sugaree and Uncle John's Band that segues into a Drums/Space with audio from the NBA Finals- no doubt on many a Chicago head's mind. MJ would go for 41-7-7 but the Bulls would come up short, losing Game 5 108-98 to the Suns before going on to win in Game 6 securing their first ever three-peat. Pretty bad Box set two opener, but the Iko quickly makes up for it. Good post-space jams: Watchtower->China Doll->Lovelight then Liberty encore. Bobby is raspier than usual, but he still belts it out. China Doll isn't perfect, but it's always special and they would only play it one more time in 93 (9/18) before retiring it in 94 (last played 10/11). Phil gets funky on Lovelight and the Liberty send-off. While it would become a staple encore, I still always love these Liberty encores.",

Must\u2019ve been something in the water. Hahaha!! Did everyone dose for this show? Really nothing to add. Except for I think someone jumped from the top. I presume during that Smokestack. Shit got pretty intense for a bit. \nThe old folk tunes were just perfect. I remember thinking, \u2018they sound just like my 70\u2019s bootlegs\u2019. \nOur tent nearly floated away that night at in our campground in Wisconsin.\nBest days of my life. Really",
