I would have loved to have paid to see Jerry sit down with an oxygen tank and a PowerBook and go nuts.\n\nJerry conjures up some scary Bela Lugosi-esque organ sounds.

I've reconfirmed that feeling after listening to this download.  It seems that the first set rolls along a bit unevenly-- a weak HC Sunshine followed by a very surprising, very strong Stranger.  (I've never been a big fan of Stranger, but the jam on it in this show is heavy, and quite surprising for song two of the set).  The rest of the first set is all right-- standard El Paso, etc., and what seems to be a rather choppy New Speedway.  (Ironically this New Speedway tends to get high marks, but I think Jerry is pulling one way and the drummers another.  I'll blame that, as I always do, on Mickey being the consistently weak link.  Good for Jerry, though, in slotting this into set one.  A good omen for what's to come).  The second set morphs into one hell of a show, though.  The jam out of Playing probably took even the band by surprise, though they'd demonstrated some of the same edginess in the first set (during Stranger).  Anyway, a very strong and adventurous second set that showed the Dead could still turn it on at times (and for inexplicable reasons).  Anyway, this is a good show later 90's show, and for those who enjoy it, I'd encourage a download of 3-28-94, which seems very underrated, especially when compared to the first set of this show.  (3/28 ends with one hell of a Music Never Stopped-- all the more reason why longtme fans have to accept the 92-95 Vince era of the band as just a different version of the Dead with its own peaks and valleys).",

Lots of blown lyrics to boot. The Dark Star, for being the final version, is underwhelming. \n\nAnd I'm a fan of 94-95 by the way.

      "review_text": "My three day goodbye Little did I know this would be my third to last show.\n\nThis run was better than the '93 shows.  The Band was clearly moving into a new creative phase - recovered from Brent's death - moving on.\n\nThe OMNI shows were often the first show of a new tour that started in the Bay Area - so the Band would be rested from months at home with family - practising new material, recharging their batteries.  The result was the Atlanta Deadheads got the best possible shows during the 90's!\n\nJust want to make two more observations: 1) The Band really liked Atlanta, the lovingly fanatical Atlanta crowd, and the absolutely electric vibe that would be present in the OMNI.  Not saying this is unique, it's not, just really powerful.  The Band, and especially Jerry, would try a lot of \"Southern\" type guitar stuff in Atlanta - slide guitar, acoustic sounds, more bluesish stuff - he could have come out and played a hand saw and folks would have loved it because they loved him and they love the Band.  This is why the Atlanta shows are so prominent - the Band was relieved of worry, and could truly experiment - or just have fun.\n2) The Dead's sound team had the OMNI totally figured out.  Their first show there was in '74 if memory serves.  Lotta practice. The sound would come up through the floor and, while not really \"loud\" (never hurt your ears), it was like being in a thunderstorm.  You could feel the air around you moving.  For those who never saw the Band live, Pink Floyd live would compare.  The music penetrated your bones.  A lot of the guitar stuff does not reproduce in recording - but at the show was \"moving\" around the OMNI, using the wall echoes to set up harmonics and deliberate standing waves.  The drums had this figured out perfectly and the \"house timing\" was calibrated in their equipment mics.  The OMNI had great acoustics, just complicated.  The GD's people had it totally mapped. I'm an engineer, and I just don't know how you could fully capture this on a recording media - 5.1 recording was not really perfected in '94, but the Miller, han, and SirMick recordings come real close to being there.  Don't think this is possible to recreate with the sources available...\n\nThe Atlanta audience was an old audience, with 3/4 of the \"young folks\" there the children, nieces, and nephews of the \"adults\".  We got \"the kids\" seats away from us, better seats, for obvious reasons.  The Band played Atlanta in the very earliest days (1967), and made a big splash.  They always felt real welcome and comfortable in Atlanta.  They knew slop would be ignored, if noticed; and this has left some of the best individual song performances ever from this artistic freedom level.\n\nThere are at least 3 other venues like this I know of, and their shows were consistently above-average, in both quality and slop.  There is a connection.\n\nHope this puts the seemingly divergent comments in perspective.  Folks are not hearing different shows, or different bands, but with different ears.\n\nThe rendition of Jack-A-Roe is definitely one of the best EVER.  It was clear that Jerry was having some trouble with some of the words, but [as always] he did his best - and this show proves that even in 1994, Jerry's dog would still hunt!  The more I listen to this show, the more I realize what a true jewel it is in the late recordings of the Grateful Dead.\n\nIMHO, this is the best show of 1994, and the best stand since the amazing April 1,2,3 1990 OMNI stand.\n\nAll the songs just shine on this recording, despite the bad microphone cable (that was replaced during the break).\n\nLiberty was just amazing and had everyone on their feet clapping by the end of the song.  We clapped for almost 5 minutes, but they were done.\n\nThis SBD is better than the Italian bootleg CD's, even though I believe this to be the source of that recording...",

The show is known for the final Dark Star and a hot 2nd-set sequence. \n\nFirst Set. After a rough and shaky start, <i>Stranger</i> is stretched into a long (for a song-2) warm-up jam. It momentarily gels for the <i>Jack-a-Roe</i>, which may be the best of '94, even with a couple bumps. Hunter probably shouldn't have written gormless, lyrics-based songs like <i>Lazy River</i> for Jer, post-'92. Vince had ideas for <i>El Paso</i> by this tour. The guy tried hard and loved his job; bless 'im. Bobby plays acoustic on a rickety-thin <i>Speedway</i> and a trainwreck of a <i>Promised Land</i> leaves the Heads confused. Aside from Jack-a-Roe, no hint of what was to come...\n\nSecond Set. The boys came back after a dismal-ish 1st set with the machine. Buckle-up for a notable sequence starting with a wild-but-tackled 29-minute pairing: <i>Scarlet</i> is one of those unique spring-'94 versions (check out the super-longs from Seattle or Eugene to see how different they were played a few months later), with the pace of a '80, and <i>Fire</i> is a best-of-'94 candidate. Sometimes in the \"decline era\" the energy of a Scarlet didn't carry into Fire, or vice-versa, but this is a pair; and check the drumming. Seems like in Spring '94 Jer had really figured out out how to play off of Vince in <i>Playing in the Band</i> (check it out right after the 4-minute mark). It uses the palette from swoony to tersely grumpy. <i>Dark Star</i> is one of only two in '94 and, although noted for being the final one, is great regardless. The Dead situation isn't prone to \"lasts\" being particular asservations but this is more than just an historical tick-lister. The quality of the SBD really gives a taste of the visceral experience that was late-era <i>Drums</i> in person (provided you have a stereo or decent soundcard, and not narrow-range, field-destroying earbuds). An epic-scale <i>Space</i> has the weird choir voices from the board and, in the middle, splashes bits of teutonic-industrial onto the Heads. Jer teases <i>Miracle</i> almost 10 minutes before it develops - maybe thinking \"okay you guys, you've tweaked me enough\" (Jer and his love for getting to <i>Stella</i>). This is total headphone shit; must have felt like a harrowing journey to some in the AUD (you know who you are even if you don't remember who you were) by the time the light of Miracle appeared. The rest is average to above average for '94. This <i>Liberty</i> is on the <b>So Many Roads</b> box and the music vid. Assumedly it's the quintessential version (is there one for this song?). A great set for '94-nose-turners.  \n\n1st Set: \u00a0 D\n2nd Set: B+\nOverall: 3 Stars \n\nHighlights:\nWhole sequence Scarlet>>Space -  A top 5 Set of '94 with a Dark Star that's more than just historical and a large-scale Drums>Space.\n\nSOURCES: The miller_14832 sounds best, except Stella has a couple dropouts (try the Larson_31806). Liberty is on <b>So Many Roads</b> and the audio was used for its music video (on <b>View from the Vault II</b>).\n\nGreat venue-tech review from fudoki (below).",

      "review_text": "Very nice space... I joined the cult late although I saw my first Dead show in '67, there were other things grabbing my attention and I knew all these shows were in my back pocket for tomorrow and I'm so grateful they are available as flacs etc. So my ears come from a different space, think Sun Ra. Anyway I probably liked Vince better than your average dead head. This is a jam that worked on several levels, still true to the Dead tradition, none the less state of the art synths, Jerry and Vince for sure maybe Bobby too. By the way Naysayer, those are sampled Gegorian Chants from the time before Bach, when music was Just and modes were the mode.",

      "review_text": "The last great Dead Spring The Grateful Dead are known for their outstanding performances during spring tours. Take, for instance, spring '72 (aka Europe '72), spring'73, spring '74, spring '77 (of course), '78, and in the latter era, spring 1990. \n\nWhile the whole '94 spring tour isn't entirely up to the snuff of these previous years, these Omni shows, 3/18, 3/21, and a few of the surrounding nights demonstrate that the spring spark was briefly reignited in the second to last year of the Dead's career. '95 does have the May Seattle Stadium run, which I can more or less also recommend, but really this was the last great Dead Spring. Jerry is rested and peppy; Bobby, Phil, and the drummers are locked in, and even old Vince is playing his heart out. Just listen to Jerry wail on New Speedway Boogie during the 3/21 show! The band are keeping time, carefully selecting scales, and placing solos and fills with precision accuracy. No, not as fantastic as spring '90, but still good.\n\nHighlights include a bitchin' HCS, Stranger, and a back-to-roots 2nd set. Also, Liberty, one of my favorite latter-era tunes, is expertly played (this version appears on the So Many Roads box).",

      "review_text": "Jerry searches for a sound This was one of the first soundboards to come out of the spring tour that year.  Some of us had been nervous that the well would go dry since Healy was gone but then this circulated soon after in pure digital.  This was the tour of \"turn it up!\"  The new sound guy did things differently and they seemed quieter than usual.  Jerry was also starting to go quiet though the soundboards from this tour don't really show that.  In retrospect, I find the first set uneventful and a little stiff and stilted like they were at the beginning of the tour.  That said, \"Jack-A-Roe is strong and fast and \"Promised Land\" could be from any year, not necessarily the penultimate one.  Second set is where it's at.  One interesting thing is that, at the beginning of the \"Dark Star\", Jerry fishes around for a sound on his midi which produces some interesting, random note zings that shoot out unexpectedly.  In fact, he's trying to find something and ultimately he finds it: that octave-slide sound that he began to use incessantly over the next year (and which would bring a Sugaree to a dead stop in a couple of months at Shoreline!)   Space is incredibly long, (again, starting a trend), and starts off with some Ligeti-inspired madness before resolving into a clean guitar run from Jerry that asks an unanswerable question.",
