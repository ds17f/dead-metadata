OK - maybe some of the Europe '72 shows were longer or more varied overall, and perhaps there were some individual songs that jammed harder (Hard to Handle in 1971, Dark Star in 1970, The Other One in 1971, etc), but for my money, this is the greatest, rockin' Dead show of all time.  What was it about upstate NY the band seemed to like so much?  All-time bests include - Half Step, Jack Straw, Music Never Stopped, Scarlet > Fire > Good Lovin', Wharf Rat, and Truckin'.  I defy you to find better versions of any of these.  Turn this up as loud as your speakers will allow and then send me your review.  In the 3rd solo of Half Step Garcia finds a jam I never could have imagined. His solo on Fire on the Mountain starts so quietly that the dissonant, crazy blast he lets go about 2 minutes later must have blown the audience away. The march/jig thing at the end of Wharf Rat is incredible, and the heavy metal ending of Truckin' is much more Pink Floyd than anything I ever expected from the Grateful Dead.  Yeah, 5/7/77 is great, and there are lots of others, but this is the #1 disc in my collection......",

It's Jerry deciding to channel the greatest eletric heroes of the age in Truckin'... Hell even Donna beats out a beautiful Sunrise in the middle somewhere.\n\nThe downsides:  Jerry has some vocal flubs in fire, and the nfa sounds and feels perfunctory.  Tennessee Jed is a total letdown after the shockingly good half-step+jack straw... The best part of St. Stephen is when the guys go back to it after jammin' out Wharf Rat.\n\nThe upsides:  Why are you still reading this?  Download this show!  Jerry gets a blood transfusion or drops some better drugs after everybody packs it in for drums, and recovers in a spactacular way.  I only wish that I was actually alive at the time of this show.  When was my first show, you ask?  6/18/83, *in utero* ;) \n\nThe crowd energy must've been off the wall.  This is definantly one of my top 5 Dead shows.\n\np.s.  Even in fire jerry's guitar is still good.  Amazing that you can be so dosed up that you start forgetting the words to one of your most common songs, but still be able to play so well...",

We all had to enter on the second floor mezzanine, and there was a large concrete ramp lending up to the enterence doors.  By the late afternoon, the whole place was packed already and it was a lovefest.  Everyone was totally pysched, the air was super charged.  Folks were pasing all sorts of drugs around, I remember someone packing my nose full of blow.  Anyway, sometime around 6 pm, the crowd blew the all the doors open and everyone just ran in. I saw cops in the crowd being spun around and having no clue what to do except save themselves.  no tickets were ever collected.  Ahhhh... general admission concerts of the 70's.  Needless to say, everyone running inside just increased the charged atmosphere.  The music was beyond the beyond.  You have to listen to this betty board.  I also remember two other things.  First, it was loud, specially the truckin jam.  Second, just before the St. Stephan, someone handed the band a street sign (Stephan st) and switched the st. and stephan.  Billy grabbed the sign and mounted it on top of one of his cymbal stands.  enjoy..",

The lows are moments of real sloppy playing and probably the absolute worst Scarlet>Fire of the period...However, the Dead more than make-up for the dogs with a positively huge Truckin'...Samson and Delilah.

      "review_text": "Moments of greatness Like many, had this last show of tour tape soon after and to this day still listen to some of the finer moments of this show. \n\nThe Half-Step is truly a great one IMHO with Boston and Englishtown in the same league (w/ the later two topping this one). 1977 was a kind year for Half-Step and I find that certain vintage years of each song have higher merits than others. I like the early '79 NYC/Philly Jack Straw's, and think '79 was the peak Jack year more than any '77, but this is surely a super strong effort for the year.\n\nThe Music Never Stopped had a bunch of can't-miss rockin' renditions from the '77-'78 era and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. What made this song special was that it was such an easy, free-wheelin', upbeat jam for anyone to follow and The Dead delivered these a dime a dozen. Jerry pops this one at the 5:15 mark, lays out a great solo, switches to rhythm, scrambles it and the band rejoins. Actually, hearing this on headphones, and better quality here, Keith is clearly out of sync near the end (sadly, the same much more obvious in the final bars of Truckin' but he does make it into the fold).\n\nI have to agree w/ others that this Scarlett/Fire has never been at the top of my list either. Maybe it's the slow opening pace or the fact that Jerry barely plays the first section. His first solo and lilting notes around the 4:15 mark are nice but much of the work through Donna's thing he's awol. This Scarlett transition is an acquired taste for those that like a less-is more-approach. The band lets this version breathe and subtle would be an apt description. Hard to say much about Fire except there are a lot of verse flubs in both main Jerry sections. Jerry wah-wahs his way through the first solo nicely, and makes up for the flubs in the second, peaking around the 8:30 mark before they bail back to Scarlett.\n\nBesides the Half-Step, \"side 2\" of the second set tape was what this show was always all about, especially when I was a budding 'Head. Sure, Jerry noodles and drifts for ideas a bit during St Stephen but the NFA gets the syncopation goin' and Jerry plays hard strings low on the fret board for quite a bit. They decide against Truckin' next and climb into a Wharf Rat that yields a jam not to be missed post 7:00 mark. Certainly one of my personal fave versions. \n\nIf you haven't heard the last 5 minutes of this version of Truckin'...you probably need to. Jerry fires off riffs against the bands rhythm all the way to the end until they all come together. If you were in attendence (not I)I think it would be so obvious you were witnessing jaw-dropping greatness.",

      "review_text": "Not perfect, but still pretty good One of the appealing aspects of 1977 (and '74 and '76) is consistent tightness with very little sloppiness. Here it is starting to creep in. But though this is not a great Scarlet>Fire, it doesn't reach the unlistenable levels of some of the stuff from the late '80s or '94-'95. This is still a good show.\n\nThe low point for me is Mexicali Blues->Me & My Uncle, which are ruined by the \"disco\" drumming of Bill and Micky. This drumming style works in Dancing in the Streets, but fails miserably on the Dead's old cowboy songs.\n\nOverall, though, the vocals are good, and, as other reviewers have said, there is plenty of good material here, including some great Jerry jamming in Mississippi, a powerful Friend of the Devil and much of the second set.

While it does rock, I just really didn't feel too great about the second set. The Scarlet>Fire seemed kind of tame. The same with the jam after St. Stephen. I do admit that the jam out of Wharf Rat was really nice though. But the greatest disappointment to me was Truckin'. All these reviews were talking about best ever but I thought it was good but not great. All in all, not a bad show but there are other '77 shows that have better versions of these songs, of course, in my opinion. I just feel that I was let down a bit after all these glowing reviews. I have to admit, '77 was a rocking year. Going into the '78 shows now, we'll see how that goes. Keep on Truckin'!!",

Seriously, though, one of the things you spot pretty quickly on this site is that every single show is someone's favorite for some emotional and/or aesthetic reason.  \"This was my first show/tape,\"  \"best tape I had, I listened to it hundreds of times,\" \"particular song really smokes.\"  There is no absolute \"best\" version of any song (although certainly every song hit its peak at some point along the way), and you especially can't compare 77 to 79 because it is two completely different bands.  One of the other things you notice pretty quickly on this site (at least I didn't completely get it until I'd spent some time here) is just how hard the boys worked to change it up every single time out.  If you listen to just one or two shows from each year, starting at the beginning, you really hear that it's a different band every year.  Kinda what they were all about-- chasing that spontaneous creative moment.  That rant out of the way, this is a great show from a great year, and one of my favorite MSN's & Truckin's too.",

The only one that comes close is 11-5-77, the day before this one. I guess they were on a roll with Half Step in early November. This one is so well jammed and nuanced, it almost sounds like Jerry Band. Jerry is so stoked he just keeps it going and going. Off the charts, GD with both guns blazing. The Jack Straw that follows makes this one of my top one/two openers of all time, along with 7-15-84 Dancin'>Bird Song and 6-11-93 Jack Straw>Foolish Heart. The rest of the first set is very well played with the rare-at-the-time Duprees, which keeps the Binghampton Aoxomoxoa streak going.\nSecond set falls off in quality IMO. With one of the worst Scarlet>Fire's I've had the misfortune of hearing. I remember right when I got this tape the Scarlet>Fire is what I wanted to hear first, I figured you couldnt miss with a 77 Scarlet>Fire...I was wrong. I think Jerry is on the nod or something cuz the Scarlet is sloppy, the transition is underdeveloped(almost nonexistent), and the Fire is a complete mess! Jerry is so spaced he only sings two of the four verses! The Truckin that closes the show more than makes up for it though, this has to be one of the very best versions of Truckin.

While the Half-Step is \"muscular\", as one reviewer noted, it is a little awkward in the beginning, as if Jer had on his winter gloves or something.  If muscular means loud and assertively played, that description fits, at least the latter part of the song.  The show is kinda hit and miss, until a surprise Dupree's shows up, to everyone's delight.  IMHO, that's when the show kicks into gear after wandering aimlessly to that point.  Passenger is good, as is the electric Dire Wolf and MNS. \nThe Samson (almost always well-played in '77) is hot to open the second set.  Sunrise is bearable, but then the Scarlet melts one's face a bit.  After that, it gets trippy and fun until the end.  Good stuff to conclude the show.\nI think four stars is a fair rating for this show due to the abundance of very average playing early on.  Can't fault the recording, as it's quite tasty.",

I would say it\u2019s definitely great! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to compare each song to different versions and get all geeked out with it. And I\u2019d rather not have overly critical people rain on my parade, And plant negative seeds with a show I find pretty amazing! Donna sounds great too! ",

This is a great show as was 11/5/77--my personal favorite to have attended! Don't sleep on the fall '77 tour!!!",
