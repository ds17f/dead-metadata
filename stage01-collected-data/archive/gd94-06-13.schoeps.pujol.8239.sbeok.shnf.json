I definitely like this lineup beter than the 1991 one--more room for Jerry, less cluttered and bloated.\n\nThis was the last show I saw--it had been years since I'd seen one but it was a few blocks from my home at the time, so I couldn't pass it up. I actually saw the next day's show, too, which was god-awful. So I'm going to call this the last one.\n\nEverything about this--setlist, performance--feels very old-school Dead. Lovely.

      "review_text": "Reminiscing  The GD in Seattle, 1994 Usually when when writing a review here, I am only reviewing the band's performance For this one though I made an exception because just getting there was a trip in itself. I remember it as if it were yesterday....   \n\nThe story begins early on a Sunday morning just outside Denver.  My friend and I had just attended the Phish Shows held at Red Rocks that weekend which left us with only one full day of driving & determination to make it the almost 1500 miles to Seattle for a 6PM Monday showtime.  We knew we'd be cutting it close because of our mode of transportation, a 1969 VW bus having a top speed of 50 MPH (on low altitude flats).... We also knew we had taken a gamble by detouring to see Phish since we already had tickets for Seattle and vehicle problems were a distinct possibility.  Luck, however, was certainly on our side that day because the trip was uneventful and the bus would need no mechanical adjustments... \n   When we finally crested Snoqualmie, the time was pushing 5 o'clock and I was starting to get a bit stressed since by that point I knew that one way or another we would be seeing Jerry, but would we get there before the show started?  I hated nothing more than missing any music at all and to me, missing the opener was a sin... \n\n   We rolled up to Seattle Center at 6 sharp and  found, of course, that available parking was not abundant however we had good parking karma and very quickly found a lot which was sporting a young adult female attendant.  As we pulled in to park I jokingly asked her if she would take my personal check and she said \"SURE\" so I said to her \"but it's from West Virginia\" and she simply asked \"is it good\" and I told her it was (it really was)...  Since I had talked myself into paying by check I quickly wrote out and signed what would be my one and only check for concert parking (she didn't even ask for ID or any additional info)....\n\n I was a dedicated taper but I knew there was no time or space to set up my rig so I grabbed my D5 and a couple cables and made a break for the stadium gates... As I waited in line to get into the venue, the crowd inside began to roar telling everyone that the boys had taken the stage.  Now I was really sweating the fact that I was going to have to pester other tapers in asking for a last second patch- something that had always really annoyed me (but those cases were usually due to ignorant people waiting 'til showtime before coming in)...   So once I was finally in, I eyed up the taping section and dashed down the stairs in hopes that in the process of making a nuisance of myself, I could score a line out before they started playing; a quest that ultimately failed since the instant I stepped onto Leon H Brigham field, the band launched into Bucket.   I then made a beeline to the mic forest with the arduous task of pleading my case to a random taper most of whom were so involved in making minor adjustments to their equipment that they didn't even notice me standing there.   To make matters worse, in begging for a patch, I would be forced to talk over the music which is another thing that has always bugged me (and in the tapers section nonetheless... Fortunately after only a couple rejections someone was sympathetic to my plight and hooked me up with a patch for which I was very grateful.   To make matters better for me he then told me that due to the space constraints, once I set my initial levels, I would have to let him \"run the deck\"... sure, I said to him (as I thought- hell yea bro you can babysit my deck for me.\" What more could I have asked for (except for maybe to have been there on time)... \n I then headed straight to the spinning section and enjoyed the rest of the set with the \"getdown crew\"..... \n\nBack in those days there was no Archive.org or anything similar so if you didn't tape the show yourself who knew when you would be able to revisit the show and since the music was the sole reason I went to shows, I liked having a tape of every show I attended- granted some of the later ones weren't all the hottest but still you never knew what to expect and afterall it was The Grateful Dead...   \n  \n\n   When I finally ran into my buddy at the set break he told me he didn't make it in until Minglewood...  Screw that!!! I don't understand how people can do that... Is the lot that more important to them than the music???   I think about all the shut out people I ran past on my way in who would have run in with me had they been handed off a ticket...  \n\nThis tape, from a very cozy stadium situated right in the shadow of the Space Needle got heated up in my deck quite often.... This place was definitely one of my favorite venues of the 90's and I had such a good time here, I went back for the three night stand the following spring...  \n   As for this concert- I thought It was quite solid.... To me, the Scarlet>fire is without question the highlight but save for a few mess ups here and there, this show is well worth a listening.     (for 1994 GD, I give it 4 stars)",

      "review_text": "My 31st show I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. This show flat-out sucked, and the recording is too tinny to tolerate.\n\nGetting close to the end here. I was living in Seattle to acquire residency in WA for college, and I was psyched the Dead were coming. They hadn't played there in a long time (for reasons I was told later had to do with some feud between the GD family and some other purveyors of illicit substances), and I snapped up tickets like a robin after the early morning earthworms. My girlfriend had never been to a Dead show, so I took her...you'd think I'd have learned by then. I wasn't the kind of young man who could deal with a) a Dead show, b) a bossy girlfriend and c) a heavy acid trip all at the same time. She actually went with me to both Seattle and the Eugene shows as well, and least said the better. Anyway, we were on the floor when they started playing Hell, and then we went up into the bleachers. \n\nIt was the first time I had heard the new sort of acousticky guitar sound Garcia was using for that tour, and on the night after this I would start to REALLY like it: very sharp and glittery and clear. However, Row Jimmy sucked, with Garcia's playing so off that I wondered why he even bothered doing a solo. He picked up steam a lot in Minglewood. Tennessee Jed was a mixed bag, with Garcia rapping out some of the most amazingly clever licks--and painfully clumsy mistakes--I had ever heard in the song. By the time the jazz fusion jam in Bird Song was well underway, I realized this was not going to be a first set to blow anybody's mind: they made up for Garcia's extra thumbs by being extra chaotic. Promised Land surely rocked tightly, but Garcia was still not playing very well. \n\nScarlet/Fire finds him faring about the same as in Tennessee Jed: alternately brilliant and abysmal, and by now I was shaking my head in amazement. As early as the previous year, word had been circulating among the more discerning of listeners that Garcia was becoming the weak link in the band (Jerry?! Say it ain't so!), but I wasn't prepared for this. \"Why doesn't he just go home?\" I blurted out at one point. My girlfriend laughed, agreeing with me. I felt bad for her, and embarrassed, this being her first show and all. But then Corrina happened, and she started dancing. She was beautiful, very curvy and had a very flowing wiggle, and she LIKED that song, so I liked it too. The suite from Corrina through Dew showed amply that the band was pretty on apart from the lead guitar, but Garcia's enormous drag factor kept the energy from going very high, apart from a very psychedelic Drums and Space. All this and another Uncle Sam encore. \"I guess it doesn't matter anyway...\" \"It matters to ME,\" I muttered. I hadn't heard a show I hated this much since 6/21/89. Seriously, Tacoma '88 was great show compared to this.\n\nIt was bitterly cold after the show, & we froze our asses off looking for the car. I could only bet that the next night would be better. Fortunately, I didn't know how right I was, as 6/14/94 would turn out to be one of my favorite shows ever. Go figure.",

      "review_text": "Yes JoeShoe is right. Joe there is definitely a SBD somewhere out there. There is one on archive from the next night and back in the day I had the pre drums from second set. This Scarlet> Fire is bigger and better than the MSG from the same year. GRUNGE baby and its all Jerry ! If you recall the highly overrated douchebag Kurt Cobain had said \" the only way I'd wear a tyedye is if its made with the blood of Jerry Garcia \" well he shot himself earlier this year and in fact Seattle Memorial Stadium is where  they had tribute event where the grunge kids rioted and trashed the place. Nice.\nAnyway HUGE versions of Birdsong Promised Land Scarlet>Fire Terrapin and MORNING DEW!!! Both Scarlet> Fire and Dew experienced a renaissance of sorts in 1994 many great versions.including S>F from MSG as well as the Dew from Rosemont on 3/17/94. Quit holdin out on us folks upload this baby!!! A beautiful night I lost my tickets and almost didn't get in but a good Samaritan found my stuff including my wallet and flight ticket home to Oakland!  We went out and feasted on fresh seafood and stayed out on the town till sunrise.",

      "review_text": "My first show This was my first Dead show, unless you count the one I was at when my mother was pregnant with me. \nIt was a life changing experience to say the least. We made the drive from Vancouver. I was 9 years old at the time. I remember parts of this show very well, like Scarlet Begonias-Fire on the Mountain and also Terrapin Station, and Morning Dew. \nWe went the following year as well and caught the amazing 5-26 show in 95 which is even more vivid in my mind.\nThese shows were a special part of my childhood, and memories that I will always treasure. I will always be thankful that my parents included me in moments like this. I have been to lots of shows and outdoor music events since but nothing will ever compare to a Dead show for me. I miss these days. Not Fade Away. Luv&Peace",

Pretty good Minglewood for the era, same goes for Tennessee Jed. This might be the best Bird Song I've heard thus far in '94. It peaks out VERY nicely. Jerry is on point throughout. \n\nSet 2 HIGHlights: Truly fine Scarlet>Fire, Corrina>Terrapin. However, Jerry botches the lyrics to Terrapin. After a string of fairly boring Drums>Space performances, this one is worth checking out. Nice Dew. I love the guy that shouts \"Day Job!\" as the encore request. Fun US Blues closes this one out. \n\nGood example of a show where Jerry was truly 'switched on' in '94. ",
