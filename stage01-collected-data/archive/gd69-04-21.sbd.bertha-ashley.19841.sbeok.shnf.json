The only thing I didn't like about this recording is that the end of feedback is cut short; probably due to the fact that the person taping it came to the end of the reel. But that wouldn't prevent me from giving it a five star rating.",

It was soooo different to the Dead I was seeing live at the time - funky and raw, like John Lee Hooker on speed.\n\nThis is one of my all time favorite VLB's, and I consider myself a connoiseur of them.  It starts driving with a nice funkychicken groove.  Jerry lights off riff after riff between lines and Phil walks his bass through all sorts of scales, blues and not.\n\nThe next 8+ minutes is primal jam heaven, building to a ridiculous fever pitch with Phil dropping Eleven-style runs and Other One hints and Jerry shredding and Bobby driving along with Pete Townshend power crunches.  The drop down jam mountain into the main groove is sick.\n\nDamn!, I love this song.\n\nShow A\nSound B+",

The rest of the first disc is also great stuff...but the Dark Star is one of my favorite versions of all time.  St. Stephen is pretty good too, but i have to disagree with this being the greatest Eleven.  You must check out 10/12/68's The Eleven, and i guarantee you'll change your mind.  Great 3rd disc as well.  Great sound quality although there are some cut outs every once in a while.  Great show in general - like the crowd you are screamin for \"MORE, MORE!\"",

      "review_text": "top 5! \"Some guys from the West coast\" is the way the Dead are introduced, but tonight they play more like some guys from another galaxy.\nSince GDP has decided to sell two of my top 5 picks for 1969 - 2/28 and 3/1 - in the new box set, I thought I'd better get the word out on this one before it disappears as well, especially for newbies who might not know what to download in 1969.\nWell, who can blame them for releasing Fillmore 69? All four shows are just mind blowing, and I'm surprised they didn't sell them sooner. Other than that run, it's the early April run at the Avalon Ballroom - and these 3 shows at the Ark in Boston that you've just gotta have for 1969. You might say that there really isn't another stand of shows consistently this good until the Oct-Nov shows at Winterland and the Fillmore (11/8, DP's #16).\nAll three nights here are strong and worth collecting. But for me and many others, it's this first night that really has the magic touch. Maybe it's the rare Foxy Lady Jam, or the stupendous version of Viola Lee. \nWhatever, the boys were on a mission to steal Boston's face, and they did!\nMorning Dew is pretty and well done. The Other One is full of mellow Jerry weavings, not as wild as others, but still cosmic and well jammed. I'm not a big fan of Drums, but here Bill and Mickey just groove solid in a fantastic duet. Then Jerry joins the drummers in a virtuostic display of expression and control before the whole band jumps into the jam. Even Doin That Rag is executed with flair and style.\nBut the main course is Set Two. And when Jerry starts it off playing a Hendrix tune - you can trust that the backstage cookies were really good, and that you're in for one amazing set. In 1969, great Dark Stars are almost a cliche', but this one earns it's reputation as one of the year's best, with 20 minutes of artfully constructed sound collages and wandering psychedelic motifs that are ever-changing. I think \"musical lava lamp\" might best describe it!! And what a fine SBD mix - you can hear everything, the cymbals, Pig's organ, Phil. The sound of this on a good stereo will leave you speechless! Prepare to slip out of time and space, until Jerry finally brings the 2nd verse at the very end. Then once again, Jerry and the drums just absolutely rip the roof off with The Eleven, sustaining intensity all the way through to firey ending.\nFinally, everything you read below about Viola Lee is true. Capt. Trips first tells the group exactly how he wants them to play it, then they launch into one of the funkiest, most outrageous versions of Viola I've ever heard. They don't play a version this good until1970, at least based on what 1969 we have.  Garcia's sound here, indeed the whole group, suggests comparisons with Live Cream. Listen to Bill's drums!!! The Feedback is unusually Twilight Zone - I'll leave you to discover it for yourself. You might want to write down your name and address first tho, just in case you forget!\nThis one is what 5 stars are about, folks. One of the top 5 for 1969, or any year. Collect all 3!!\nA big thanks to Grendelschoice for reminding me to review this classic show!\nMelted and deep fried,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

The version of Alligator is horrible with some of the worst vocals by the band of all time, seriously it SUCKs. However the second set beginning with sloppy foxy lady jam ( obviously done for fun by the guys) is amazing. Dark Star> St Stephen and especially the Eleven and Turn On Your Lovelight are fantastic, as is Viola Lee Blues. Truly the first set is 3 stars at best but coupled with the dynamite second set this is a 4 star recording. Hot damn! the dead made up for a lack lustre first set with a smoking second one.",

I can't nail it down better than that.\n\nBut I did want to say the Viola Lee Blues just doesn't work for me as much as other reviewers suggest.  I love that song, but believe it's best versions predate much of what was played in 69 and after as the band slowed the song down a few licks, and it's one that works best played full bore.  Check out the versions from 67, many are amazingly well developed for a group that was just starting to figure itself out.",

First set is solid with nice versions of the other one and alligator, especially the gator which has a unique jerry jam.\n\nSet two is just classic tho, starting off with a great dark star. certainly a standout version, but i have to say that the next night's dark star completely and utterly blows this one away. just destroys it. But the fun of this night continues with a great st. stephen that is well played (ringing bells and all) and a HOT version of the eleven segueing into an equally hot Lovelight. And the sweet, gooey icing is a barnburner of Viola Lee. This one runs wild while still somehow staying in control;easily the best version i've heard in '69. \n\nThis show and 4/5 are the best of april, so check 'em out...",

Right away I have to say I was a little disheartened with Hard to Handle. They were pretty much all over the place and by the time they got their shit together the tune was basically over. I could tell however that Pig was having a great night vocally. On the heels of that disappointment came Dew..I liked it although it was not nearly as sparky at the end as many of the Early Dew\u2019s I treasure so much. Good Dew, not great Dew. So Cryptical starts and I am happy from the jump. I thought this particular version was very nice with a great transition into TOO and a healthy reprise to round it out. I added Sittin to this jam because if I remember correctly they went right into it. I love a good sitting like this one. It reminds me of Cumberland and I wish they kept it(perhaps I am the only one). After a false start The Gator>Drums>jam>Rag begins and I am diggin the shit outta it. Pigpen sounds great, nice and relaxed with no detectable hang ups in his voice. Well played and well jammed with a OK transition into Rag. Now Rag is my jam and I am somewhat of a coinsure these days. This one is very good but the jam out left me a lil flat. I dug it, I really did but it just lacked some oomph at the end. The first set has ended and I am left thinking it was good but not great. \n\nWe open the second set with perhaps the stupidest thing they have ever done, the Foxy Lady Jam. Was it me or did this straight up suck balls? They just stopped and kinda screwed around for a few minutes before Dark Star. Anyways, Dark Star comes on and I notice something. It is very reminiscent of many others yet it never seems to really develop into anything. I mean, it does but Jerry just kinda drops right back into the vocals after 20 min and stops it. I think they mighta been frustrated or just having a little problem following each other or something. Stephen came on very strong and Eleven crushed it. Both tunes full of fire and Phil goes into full bezerker mode for most of Eleven\u2026Lovelight comes next and Pig is in charge. Although this would not be a top pick for me, good one none the less. Viola>Feedback for the encore and I enjoyed them both. Viola as a closer\u2026Hmm\u2026Anyhow, that is that and I am left with a altogether different opinion than I had prior to this relisten. \n\nThis is a perfect example of a very good show which could have been a top shelf show. I have no problems with this one yet it just did not have the grab of many others(especially the following night)from right around this time. So close so many times to brilliance, yet, not tonight.... I do recommend this show however, and I give it a B.",
