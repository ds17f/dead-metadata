I like Jerry's sound and his picking is sharp, especially the 2nd solo during UJB.  Bob does break out the slide a little too much but it's not out of tune.  Also not listed is a little Playin Jam out of China Doll into the drums.\n\nMorning Dew lovers need this show.  I have always liked the way they spaced into this Dew and Phil has a couple blowouts during the middle jam that must have driven Healy nuts.  Great dynamics and while the end is not as long as Barton Hall it is very moving.  \"Guess it doesn't matter, anyway!\"",

      "review_text": "In the Shadow of a Giant It's a shame that the good folks at Grateful Dead Productions didn't have the foresight to release this show as a companion to DP21 as they did with the May '77 releases that made up DP29 because this is one great show.  \n\nAs noted in the liner notes to DP21, there was some overall weirdness that started at the Halloween show in South Carolina that carried over and northward to Richmond for the two night run there.  This review is limited to my opinions and impressions of the 2d set.\n\nIko starts off on a very jangly vibe, real loose and bumpy, with some solid Garcia vocals and Mydland shadings.  Weir shifts gears quickly and affirmatively with a well-delivered Estimated Prophet that melts into an outro jam for several minutes before landing at Uncle John's doorstep.  To me, Garcia was a double threat.  Emotionally, his voice leant poignancy, vibrancy, creativity, and many other adjectives to the proceedings, and naturally, the notes he pulled from Wolf, Tiger, and his other axes speak for themself.  Here its the vocal lead that really gets me going, and this is particularly so during a great China Doll that Garcia lends a real contemplative perspective to, hitting the words hard, really letting them sink in, and then flavoring his vocal stew with the memorable leads we all know and love.\n\nDrums>Space continues the rub of buzzing, clicking, and other unusual sounds that is the signature sound of this segment from '85.  Space melts into a very strong Morning Dew that again, Jerry just imbues with a force, power and energy that only he could provide.  As might be expected, the Stones>Lovelight seems a wee bit anti-climactic, but are both solid.  Baby Blue is a great encore, and were it not for the prior night, I think this show would get far greater attention.  \n\nOne note on your various downloading choices.  This is a crystal clear SBD, with an outstanding mix.  I had an AUD version for many years that sounded like the boys were in a canyon, so for those that like that audience mix, give in and grab a top notch SBD.  \n\nI'd give it 4.5 if it were an option, but since it's not, I'm going 4 stars, and a high recommendation.\n\nENJOY\n\nPS .. It goes without saying that the people at the Archive have literally fulfilled the dreams of many DeadHeads by giving us what is essentially the \"skeleton key\" into the Vault.  I cannot thank you all enough for putting all of this wonderful music up on the Internet and making it available to the masses.",

      "review_text": "Cherry poppin' This was also my first show and I went with no clue what the Dead were or what type of music they played. I walked around and checked people out for most of the first set but by the time the second set started I was glued to the stage. At the time I was into 80's punk music and reggae (went to a lot of Bad Brains shows growing up) and I didn't even know a live band could sound like that. By the time Bobby ripped into Estimated I had found my new idol. I was hooked. The Dew out of Space is the highlight in my opinion. This was a perfect spot for the song and it always added an extra touch to an already dramatic song. The second set of this show is a great example of solid Dead. They have gone at it with a lot more ferocity at other times but this second set is clean and prime like a studio release. Good SB should be easy to find of this night. The previous night is available on Dick's Picks, which brings up my only bone to pick with this show. Being that this was my first show and had the choice of going to Fri or Sat night I picked Sat. How could I have known that my first show could have been the all time schorcher that is 11/1/85. If you've never heard it, get it. The Band goes off and pulls out one of the craziest second sets they ever played.",

      "review_text": "Space to Dew is Spiritual First tape I ever had (~86).  It was crusty, hissy, and choppy, but never failed to please.  Hearing the Space into Dew is what I consider quintessential, natural Dead.  IMHO, it was never about THE SHOW, it was about what makes you keep coming back for more;  that instance when the boys brought it all together when the game plan busted and their natural ability to create art would take over.  And for me, it is the transition into Dew here.  Nice to hear a clean SBD version.  However, the audience hissy'ness is still preferable.  I guess it is nostalgic for me.",

You know this is the beauty of this site.  you can go to a show that has been downloaded 50,000 times then go to the show before or after, and it be just as good if not better. I LOVE THIS SITE! Any way this first set is grate. I would have like to have seen an \"all over now\" in place of \"CC rider\". but that is just an opinion.\n  The secon set was amazing as well.  very nice song selection here. Like the \"Aiko\",Estimated,U.J.B.,China doll! Magnificent.  then you have the DEW out of drums.  and the placement of morning dew says to me that it was all emotion and feeling right then.  Jerry wanted to play it right then! I love it!  a great addition to your 85' collection for sure.           \n\n                  peace.",

I would say it is easily the best 1980's Dew I have ever heard, I would sure love to hear other great Morning Dews if peeps have suggestions! But it is an absolutely stellar version, sound quality is great, phil sounds AWESOME, bobby's wacky sounds are perfect, brent is brent (fucking amazing) and jerry plays great, and ik his voice is not very good, but i love it anyways. I love all his different voices. The Throwing Stones is also really really good, and thats coming from someone who ALWAYS skips that tune, really great version.\n\nHavent given the show enough listening, but this show deserves a 5 star rating on just the last two set closing tunes and sound quality.\n\nAhh phil has such great bombs in this one, such a AWESOME DEW!",

Casting a 'rating' based on someone else personal opinion is a great disservice to all of us. Like him or not Bobby was a founding member and HUGE contributor to the over all success and longevity of the GD. Fortunately in this case my review of you as a class A loser is consistent with the review of the great show. Five Stars!!!",

Good rendition. Greatest Story, though it ain't one of my favorite songs, is excellent. Dupree's is inexplicably great. CC Rider is really good and would be better if Bob's slide solo were louder. I think it's Weir. It is great slide playing. Speaking of the sound, other than what I just mentioned, the sound on this show is outstanding: 5 stars. Althea is great musically, but what's a Dead show w/o Jerry forgetting a few lyrics? Esau-- another one that's not a fav-- is well played. Candy Man is excellent. Let it Grow is good. Iko is fun as usual. Estimated is particularly tight! Uncle-- don't mind more forgotten lyrics-- this Uncle John's Band flows like a winding stream, beautifully!!! China Doll is gorgeous, even better than usual methinks. Oh, it includes a brief Playin' tease. Dew? Well, it's Morning Dew-- what more do you want? Throwing Stones w/ a brief NFA tease and Love Light are just fine. The Baby Blue encore is a nice way to end this one.",

Standing outside with a ticket hearing Bertha and you couldn't get in the door. People chanting the Who...The Who......that rececenly had a show where a number of people had been trampled to death. Very ugly scene outside that night. The show was good...organization was not. They were banned from Richmond after that by the powers that be which is damn shame cause it wasn't the the fans that caused the problem. JGB did play there in 93...didn't see it but heard it was the best show of the tour. Again...shame cause they were going to play at the racetrack in summer of 87 but they were banned. They played Roanoke Virginia instead. Both good shows.",

I used to have Bob Messina's audience recording which captures a beautiful keyboard flourish. It really sets the tone. One thing that the board recording does not capture is the way Phil shredded the PA during the Dew. Later, I heard that he'd discovered how to crack the stack during summer tour and they were going to replace the whole PA after Worcester so he just went at it with no mercy.",
