Much respect to Ornette, but he never really meshes with the band, Lovelight has a little funk to it, but doesn't scratch the surface until the end. Overall, great idea, not great results. But hey, I listened for the novelty factor and so should you, just keep the expectations low my friends.",

      "review_text": "Mardi Gras! This version seems to have a cassette generation, and is not as clean as the other.  The other version captures the overall power of the evening much more.  Still, I yearn to hear a great DAT>Aud master of this.  The feeling in the room really translated nicely on my old cassettes.\n\nI got speeding tickets in King City coming up for this one, and returning home.  All three nights were great, but this one was cathartic.  A total brain fuck.\n\nSat with my ex-girlfriend and her family this night.  Stoned to death.  Ornette and his band played a set early on, but the lights were only slightly dimmed, and the sound was generally inaudible.  Jerry stepped out and played on the final song.  \n\nWhen the Dead hit the stage, Jerry had Wolf in his hands.  This guitar can be viewd in the Grateful Dead movie.  Felt like '74 in there.  Crisp, mellow, soulful playing.  The whole vibe was, I don't know, very different.  Cold Rain had a great bounccy bass from Phil, and Jerry just played so crisp.  Wang Dang Doodle.  Loser with a powerrful solo.  Broken Arrow was a great break out, and at one point, Phil's voice permeated the entire room witth such resonance.  Memphis Blues was crisp as well.  Not that over-the-top exaggerated energy of usual.  Excellent, and something was definitely afoot.\n\nWay to Go Home in the first set; at last, one version in the place where the song belongs.  Never enjoyed it more.  The song always flet out of place in the second set, but that's old news to most.\n\nJohnny B. Goode roared the set to a close.  It was so powerful... I didn't know Jerry could play with that kind of ferocity.  Never heard a great one till 2/23.  It was clear; something was definitely afoot.  \n\nSecond set began with the Mardi Gras drums into Iko.  Very psychedelic, with Phil in the lead.  Corrina followed, like some evil joke, and the new Lazy River Road followed; two repeats in a row from the first night.  Strange.\n\nPlayin' in the Band followed, and the  band did a firstt rate melt down, Vince integrating himself with unusual precision.  The jam didn't get particularly intense, but this went further out than any recent Dark Star.\n\nDrums... digeridoo, sourround sound swirling around the coliseum, the whole place going bonkers.  Jerry returns, and from the bowels of space, a saxaphone in the fog.  And Ornette steps out for some freestyling.  The band returns, and the wrestling match begins.  The Dead enter the Other One, and Ornette leads them back into space.  Again and again, screaming with greater and greater intensity.  Phil, Jerry and the drums stomp out the Other One riff like never before.  Walls of sound, screams, meltdowns, explosions, ... those who say that this one never gets off the ground just don't comprehend what went down.  This was singularly the most intense thing I ever witnessed.  \n\nThe first verse, and then the jam between the verses.  If I recall correctly, there  were two compelling climaxes here.  So over the top, so frightening, so stoned.  Later one of my favorite recordings of the Vince era.  Later stolen from my collection.  After later... The Other One chills, and Stella Blue follows.  Ornette has his own way off integrating himself; navigates the  cracks of time and space, harmonizing so beautifully.  The jam at the end is long and involved.\n\nLovelight was outstanding as well.  A performance that holds its own, Ornette and Jerry just goin for it, all the way to the final moment.\n\nThe encore left me stunned.  I never felt so mortal in my life.  \n\nThis show is no ligh weight.  The heaviest concert I've ever attended.  And here is a record of what went down.  You can't comprehend it by basing yourself on what each song should be.  Likely, you will find some permutation that sets it apart here.\n\nOrnette's appearance in Dec. in L.A., by contrast, did nothing for me.  Sounds like Ornette sitting in with the Dead.  Here, Ornette makes a statement that changes the Dead in some significant way.  There is nothing else like it, nothing I am aware of.  \n\nProceed with caution, and rejoice.\n\nAfter note; big problem with this mix.  Phil is deceptively quiet.  He was in lead-bass mode, loud, crisp, bouncey and wonderfully modulated this night.  I am sure an audience recording is the only way to capture the essence of this show.  Without Phil correctly represented in the mix, it is hard to appreciate what went down.  call your firends.  get that audience DAT and make it available (please!)",

I also attended the night before in which Jerry had all kinds of problems with his guitar. On this night, just before the show started, a great fuss sprang up backstage with people saying \"Jerry's guitar just BROKE\". I asked what they meant someone said it had snapped in two. Roadies were rushing around and I was told it was not a good time to visit the stage to check arrangements for my didgeridoo appearance. So he was definitely playing a substitute guitar that night, but I can't tell you what it was. One way or another it sounded much sweeter than the night before.",
