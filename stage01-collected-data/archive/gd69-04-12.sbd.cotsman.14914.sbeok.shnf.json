I always wondered who Spirit of Creation was though...The warm-up act on the bill. The artist is Richard Taylor, of Rainbow Jam (early computerized light shows) fame back then. I got to meet him this past year and have him sign my poster in San Anselmo. He was a real nice guy. \n\nCool show considering the venue and the times. I didn't know that Utah could actually be a cool (well, sort of cool anyway) place until 1985, when I finally went there to hike and do some desert and mountain camping.\n\n-Pulver",

      "review_text": "A-U-C <br />This was part of a short campus ballroom tour at universities of AZ>UT>CO. After a club gig in Omaha they then resumed campuses, including the incredible show @Wash U in Saint Lou, then Purdue & Clark. This is the first of 9 Utah shows and 7 bookings ['95 was a run]. Note that the poster says these sets were ticketed as two shows, at 8pm & 10pm (this is why Bobby says they're done after the first set and the announcer ends the show). This means they were going to turn the house, which was common in '68>'70, but it sounds like the turnout was small enough that they may have let the early ticket holders stay while the second holders arrived. The second show is shorter than the usual on nights they turned the house. Either there is another song missing, or this was contractual obligation [not that that ever stopped the Dead from playing another half hour], or there was a curfew. The latter is most likely, since in Utah in '69 the majority of the population had never witnessed a midnight. Not only did Utah campuses have strict curfews, this was back when the proposal of live rock-n-roll caused angry letters, protests, spiritual crises and gnashing of teeth. The show was sponsored by Students for a Democratic Society, rescheduled from an initial March date. <b>AoxoMoxoA</b> hadn't been released on time, so they weren't touring the LP. <b>Anthem</b> was likely the only LP in Utah stores at the time, if any.\n\nEarly Show. <i>Dew</i> is a good opener choice for any students that had bought the first LP. Bobby then starts his Yellow Dog joke, but they cut him off to launch Pig. <i>Schoolgirl</i> is yr avg '69, but Jer and Pig playing off each other is always good. Bobby tries to finish Yellow Dog but Pigpen steals the punchline and Billy [sounds like] recommends \"You don't have to laugh - nobody does\". The 26th has the big one, but this <i>Doin' That Rag</i> is nice. <i>Just a Hand to Hold</i> maintains many maudlin monotonous minutes. The first <i>Cryptical</i> is cut after 1min. Most of The Other One is missing, coming back at the second <i>Cryptical</i> (the previous night's has a cut too). Probably 10-15mins is missing. Too bad - what we have is really good.\n\nLate Show. <i>Dark Star</i> is missing probably 1>5min from the beginning. It's the standard '69 format [a Sputnik @10:25 and so forth]. The 17th & 27th are the tour's big ones (even if they don't have the discovery-majesty of the Feb versions). Imagine never having heard <i>St. Stephen</i> before going to this show. This is before prog broke, and it sounds like a medley, and then they pause to light a freaking cannon, then it sounds like TC plays a madrigal... Surely some students became fans. It's not unique so much as sterling, and leads to a <i>The Eleven</i> that absolutely smokes. Sink beneath the water to the coral sands below. You will notice a splice in <i>Lovelight</i> @16secs where it speeds up, switching to a different source (presumedly the same show...). Nothing above the average here, but they may have been at the curfew because the announcer tries to announce them offstage as they enter <i>Feedback</i>; the tape of which cuts off, probably missing 3-7mins. There was most likely a Bid You Goodnight.\n\n<u>Early Show</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>Late Show</u>: \u00a0\u00a0B\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nCryptical Envelopment - we have the tail of a TifTOO that tantalizes\nSt. Stephen - not unique as much as sterling\nThe Eleven - sink beneath the water to the coral sands below\n\nSOURCES: The SBD needs a little pitch correction for authentic playback. It starts to get a tad slow at Doin That Rag and then <u>needs +1% starting at</u> Just a Hand to Hold, and through the first set. From 16secs in Lovelight <u>to the end it needs -1%</u>.",
