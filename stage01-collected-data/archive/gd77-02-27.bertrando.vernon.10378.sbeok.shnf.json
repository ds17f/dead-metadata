      "review_text": "worth a careful listen... I was lucky enough the see the Dead intermittently over a 20 year period, starting in the golden summer of 1974 with the Wall of Sound (as a high school student), through the endless summer afternoons in Hartford, Ventura, and elsewhere, finally ending up at Highgate, Vermont in 1994 (as a professor with my graduate students). Over that period (and before) I have been fortunate to be surrounded by tapeheads at every turn, and followed the band\\'s every musical twist and turn. \n\n To this day, the Robertson Gym show (2/27/77) stands out in my mind as the best of all shows I was lucky enough to hear in person. The discerning listener will notice that the previous night in San Berdoo is the #3 favorite download of all time, while #2 is the Barton Hall show at Cornell later that spring. So there was some serious mojo going on in 1977, as many have noted. While the Terrapin that opened the previous night was quite an extraordinary thing to behold, the rest of what followed hewed pretty closely to what we heard that night in Rob Gym. So why do I feel this show is so special?\n\nThe first point is that, in contrast to nearly all other concerts I ever attended, this show was possessed of a remarkable combination of controlled fury and brevity, not a single extraneous note all night. Often, the music in a dead show is like a car trying to leave the parking lot in a mall, backing in and out of spaces in hopes of finding egress. None of that here. Instead, Rob Gym featured an exquisite balance between the fixed structure of the song and improvisational tension contributed by the band. The individual performances were remarkable. Weir in particular was a man posessed, a veritable growling tiger: check out Minglewood, Sampson & Delilah, and Estimated. Donna is always a controversial element of the band's sound, here she hits all the notes spot on for a change. Jerry unwraps a new paint box of guitar tones for these 1977 shows- check out the Roy Buchanan-esque solo in Loser. Finally, the drumming in this show is incredible; Bill and Mickey are locked beautifully throughout, providing an incredible sense of propulsion that drives the band without a single let up. Finally, follow how the band beautifully manipulates the tempos and dynamics throughout.\n\nAs for individual songs, I will let the listener explore these: save one. The band closed the first set with one of the prettiest readings of Scarlet Begonias you will hear, including the version at Barton Hall played months later that others have raved about. It's instructive to compare the two versions. At Rob Gym, the song was a perfectly self contained little symphonic tone poem, with a beatiful jazzy cadenza that springs out from Donna's melisma, hitting several nice little peaks before closing strongly on the final chorus. In later shows, this song would develop the link into Fire on the Mountain. As nice as many of those renditions were, FOTM is anchored by a simple 2 chord progression that can be as much a trap as an element of musical liberation. In comparison to the Barton Hall performance of Scarlet, the tempo of the Rob Gym version of Scarlet is much crisper throughout, and stands on its own merits.\n\nYou will also notice that much of the structure and song selection of Rob Gym would show up in the Barton Hall set list and sequences. Thus, if you want to understand why the spring tour of 1977 represents one of the high points of the band's 30 year career, you must go back and sample pivotal 2/26 and 2/27 shows, where the experimental work to develop the musical program was done. Having never talked to anyone in the band personally, I can only guess that they studied those tapes carefully, and figured out how to capture lightning in a jar.",

It's full and well-balanced, if a tad cymbal-heavy, and even with all the kind SBDs from the era, I just keep coming back to this AUD. The first set is interesting, with a mid-set early Weir rendition of \"Good Lovin'\" (sans \"rap\") and a set-closing, light-on-the-Donna \"Scarlet Begonias\" that features a big hot jam. Unfortunately the first few seconds of \"St. Stephen\" are missing, and \"Drums\" has a cut, but this is a superlative concert. I have no words for the \"Terrapin Station\" > \"Morning Dew\" sequence. I guess this show will always stand in the shadow of Swing Auditorium's shaft of light, but this performance is angelic in its own right. These men gonna light my way.",

This is because those with nothing relevant to add about a particular show will give a one-star rating for no apparent reason.  In one or more cases here it appeared that our reviewer was influenced by resentment.  Anyhow, I get to listen to a major show with the given qualities I prefer -- good AUD tape, rockin' audience, my favorite band.\n     I give at least one star for each member of the band who showed up to play and/or sing.  So five would have to be about the minimum.  Mine goes up to eleven.  2/27/77 was right up there.",

I think the  first set is better than 75% of 1977 material.\n\nThat being said how can people rate this one of the top, if not top show of 1977?  First, it's an AUD. So it can't be top.  The problem with AUD's are you don't all frequencies with the same intensity.  Billy and Mickey seem like they are 30 yards away from the music.  In addition it's quite hard to hear Keith and this was his best year as evidence to everything he played in May 1977.\n\nThe show may be a 4-5 star, but we will never know unless we get a SBD.  This is a decent AUD, I have better ones in my iTunes and iPod.  I've downloaded about 200 SBD and AUD's over the past year and this is above average, but not excellent.\n\nBy the way, for an example of a great AUD download the recent Fundraiser for Obama on this website, courtesy of Phil, Bobby, and Mickey.  Now that is a brilliant AUD.",

Now wvery one loves a soundboard, me included. But if you listen to this show what jumps out at ya is the energy is amazing, due in part to the crowd. Also Jerry's playing on this eve is over the top. Just listen to scarlet, music, dew--these are incredible versions of these songs in a year that has many incredible versions. If you want to be biased because this is an audience tape ( and for a tape from 31 years ago this is a great aud) so be it. If you want to hear 2 other amazing auds from '77 check out 11/5/77 from Rochester and 11/4/77 from Colgate-both of which I listen to over the boards! Enjoy the tunes!",

There are interesting bits, but it sounds pretty average to me, in general. I wouldn't rank it even in the top 10 of the year.  How anyone could compare it favorably to 2/26 is baffling; IMHO, 2/26 is one of the greats of '77 or any year for that matter.  After reading (mostly) glowing reviews, I was disappointed in this show.  It's got decent sound for an AUD, but just for the show alone, I truly don't think it deserves more than 3 stars.

Unfortunately I'm laid up with a broken leg so I'll have to wait for a review. But if this is what they choose to play, it's an outstanding setlist with Ramble, Mississippi, Music Never Stopped, St. Stephen, Terrapin, Dew-don't think I could've picked a better one. As I listened to this show (a fine show with them doing what only they can) and read some reviews, I noticed some oddball - SIZHLA - call all the band members but Jerry dirtbags. It's really apparent this guy has never had this music work it's way into his soul, assuming that's intact.  He just doesn't get it because to say that, to me, is sacriligeous. I mean, how far up his ass IS his head?  We all have our different opinions on shows, that's natural. But the community can handle that cause we're all unique, different head spaces, venues, drugs taken or not, band's hot or not. But name calling-not cool little brother. I've alwaysbeen a laid back guy, but this pissed me off-could be the good medication. My Dead history runs about 50 shows from '70 - '94 and I've always taken the good with the bad and enjoyed every minute.

There are obviously huge differneces between the various decades the band performed in, huge differences that tend to alienate one fanbase from another, which is really too bad. I still have trouble giving any one of the shows from '77 a true 5 star, but prefer to lump them together as an awesome 5 star year.

Plus it doesn't really stack up to those, overall, but '77 fans will delight in this GOGD. It's only complete as an AUD, of which there is only one. The show, in the campus gym, was low-key and had only a couple thousand in attendance (it's just a 3500-seater). It's a short second set & show but sounds like a '77 for sure.\n\nFirst Set. The first set isn't as consistent as you find on the Spring tour, and not at all like the previous night. <i>Ramble</i> is the peak, <i>Scarlet</i> is the fireworks (and like the set's own encore). <i>Good Lovin'</i> is a little off and <i>Peggy-O</i> is understated. <i>Estimated</i> is the second-ever and still in the early arrangement (and has the \"I'll ascend on wings of flame\" stanza). The end jam is just starting to gel. \n\"When the band finished <i>Music Never Stopped</i>, Jerry and Bob started to take off their guitars, and Phil came running over to Jerry holding up his finger, clearly indicating 'one more'. Jerry shrugged, re-strapped his guitar and fired up  Scarlet Begonias.\" \u2013 Corry (via dead.net).\n\nSecond Set. Keith is hot this show, and though you might not hear him in the mix everywhere, when you do he shines. The set's quite short, at just over an hour (the first was 1: 25) \u2013 short and sweet. <i>Samson</i> has a careening second solo, with edge-of-seat appeal and excitement beyond technical perfection. A unique <i>St. Stephen</i> has power-chorded downbeats and almost goes somewhere else; another not-so-perfect one with odd, energy appeal. <i>Not Fade</i> is cohesive in spots, in others brilliant, but they're not interested in playing together here or during <i>Drums</i>. They were still breaking out <i>Terrapin</i> (it's the 2nd-ever), so it comes off identical to the previous night (i. e. as practiced). <i>Morning Dew</i> is likewise a straight read. Bobby and Donna are great on <i>Sugar Mag</i> but the rest are flagging and turn in a short show. But not before they muster for a solid <i>JBG</i>.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B-\nOverall = 3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nScarlet Begonias \u2013 different tasting jam & the last before being attached to Fire\nSamson & Delilah \u2013 feeding from the Heads and pouring it back on top\nSt. Stephen \u2013 in it's '77 version, but a bit heavier\n\nSOURCES: It's a great Bertrando AUD and I would argue that it's all you need. One dude stepped up to the plate \u2013 and taped a work of art. This is (apparently) one of the missing Betty Boards. The last three songs are all that's available from the SBD (144912_sbd_pc_miller), and have also been OFFicially released on <b>Dave's 29</b>. The bertrando_vernon_10378 has blips in Mississippi Half-Step and a posted but unlisted Minglewood. The current upgrade is the 145195_sony. This source does not have dropouts in Mississippi Half-Step, Drums is complete, it restores the Minglewood that went missing from the player and fixes Morning Dew. It has been EQd for highs and the channels are switched, but it has the best image and is the first complete source.",
