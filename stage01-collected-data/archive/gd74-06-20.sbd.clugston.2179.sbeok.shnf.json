Just after they start truckin' billy does a little stutter beat and they accelerate the song's pace. There are some technical pops and snaps during the 1rst few minutes of truckin' but the band is so tight. Jerry and keith in particular are getting things done(check out jerry's breakaway from the ending jam in truckin', clear as blue sky). Eyes is one of the finest, starts off with a \"click\" of an effects pedal a split second before the opening chords. Slipknot is very primative, not fully developed, sounds like they just stumbled into it as they were noodling along. Good stuff.....",

As for this board i think the quality is great, nice and crispy with clear vocals and instruments. My highlights are china doll, ship of fools, truckin and eyes. there are a few small dropouts in China Cat and a tiny tiny one at the very end of China Doll but there not really drop outs, more like volume plunges because its just quieter for a second or two but its hard a big deal. also if you like this, then you should check out the nice Miller SBD of 6/30/74 - Springfield Civic Center thats floating around here.",

      "review_text": "June 20, 1974 First, this show was played at the Omni, not the Municipal Auditorium - so I don't know why, after several years, you guys at the archive have yet to corrected this mis-labelling.  After listening to the streaming audio, a bit more is coming back to me:  As I recall, Maria Muldaur played for quite awhile as the opener, including a fabulous Midnight at the Oasis, and the Dead got a rather late start.  The Dead\u2019s first set was fairly short due to some techincal difficulties the Wall of Sound.  But these were resolved after a long break and the second set actually opened with Jack Straw - the first A chord following \u201c..wine!\u201d rolled like a peaceful tidal wave across the Omni.  And with the power of the Wall behind them, that's something that you just can't capture on tape, no matter how hard you try.  You just had to be there.  Really spectacular.  There is also a Sugar Magnolia missing from the tapes and this was played after China Doll \u2013 the guys never would have left us hanging after a song like that.  That probably also explains why there is a tape break during Truckin'. The second set was long!  They lit the disco ball for Sugar Magnolia and the place was flying.  On the final One More Saturday Night, Bobby ran back to his amp to make some adjustments, then ran back to hit the mike right on queue for the final chorus.  The place literally went nuts and I\u2019m sure that they were telling us, in their own special way, that we were all riding the same rainbow that night!  This was truly a magical show as evidenced by Phil\u2019s emphatic \u201cThank you and goodnight!\u201d at the end.  No encore necessary and not a soul complained!  This one needs to be on a CD for everyone to hear.  I've been waiting for it for 35 years!",

      "review_text": "The Night I Met Jerry.... This memorable concert was a GIFT to find!  Yes, there were problems with the \"Wall of Sound\", but I'll never forget the shock when I saw the stage; that year I had seen The Who, Moody Blues, Johnny Winter, and The Kinks (among others), and NOTHING compared to the amazing sound that The Wall produced.  No distortion whatever, and mindbending volume.  During the LOOONNNGGG break, after a couple of the amps literally blew up (not loud, just smoke and sparks on stage left, our seats were Left Loge) I got bored and antsy and grabbed my buddy's 16 y.o. girlfriend, about the most beautiful girl I had met back then, and said \"go where I point you\".  We slipped right past \"Security\" (bikers, or looked like bikers) with a \"Jerry's expecting her\", and walked behind the backstage curtain.  Jerry was sitting alone on a wooden sawhorse, smoking a cigarette.  I was dumbstruck - he was right there.  I was speechless, literally, and he smiled and asked if we were enjoying the show, We were saying \"Yessir!\" when two bikers appeared, ready to grab us.  Jerry stood up and said, \"It's cool man, they're with me...\".  He reached into his back pocket and handed me two passes to the after-party, and invited ME to leave.  I did so.  About 15 minutes later, my buddy's girlfriend came back - boy was my friend pissed!  She said \"everything was going great until he asked me how old I was...\"  Then she was jettisoned like a bad penny.  We dumped the dates after the show and went back to the after-party, which was real fun...  Everyone was so nice, and we knew some folks in common.  Over the years, the Band started coming to Atlanta over my birthday weekend (April 2nd), not for me, the Band loves the dogwoods and azaleas in Atlanta that bloom then.  Over the years we were invited to a couple more after-parties, etc.  These guys are the best, as people, unspoiled by success, and it has always showed in their truly American music.\n\nUPDATE:  Not to be a contrarian, but the show was one of the last major rock shows at the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium.  Still have the ticket stubs.  The \"Wall of Sound\" covered the entire stage and was stacked up what appeared to be about 50 feet high, but we were looking down on it from the left lower (mezzanine) balcony, front row - called the \"Loge\" in Atlanta (at the Muni and Fox).  This was the last concert I ever attended at the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium - a truly great - if concretey echoy - venue.  Yes, Maria Muldaur opened, and it seemed like FOREVER until she was done - not that she wouldn't have been great on her own...\nAnd, yes, the second set was beyond what words can describe!  Once they got the WoS tuned... well, I have never heard such a pure sound in concert.  The \"Brown Owlsey\" didn't hurt either that night!  1/2 before, 1 1/2 at the break.  Tuned the scene to the infinity channel...",

The sequence starting with Truckin' > Jam > Eyes > Slipknot! > China Doll is full of jazzy jams.  This is the best eyes I've heard - Bob is really jazzy throughout and the jam is so musical.  To me this feels like the birth of slipknot, Jerry keeps pushing until it emerges from its shell!  Lovely stuff, with a pensive China Doll to round out the series.  \n\nThis source sounds great, imo.  The mix is right, little/no hiss, strong levels.

Truckin' i think just might be my favorite performance of this song of the year - the soloing is just out of control, so much energy here! then, space beautifully lands into an epic, uber jazzy Eyes. although 6/18 could be considered the most \"perfect\" performance of '74, this one actually might just be the best. it has to be heard to be believed. Jerry and Phil do not quit! the first fully realized version of Slipknot is the icing on top...then throw on a really unique China Doll for a cherry, and you've got yourself one awesome show...\n\nif you've heard 6/16, 6/18, 6/23, and 6/28, be sure to hear this gem next!",

Listened once without headphones, once with.  \n\nYes, everybody needs to listen to what folks are calling Slipknot, which doesn't quite get to it until about 2:40.  Around the four minute mark, Garcia applies the brakes, and they somehow go from 100 MPH to near zero in twenty seconds.\n\nThe Eyes is very interesting, Jerry tossing off some jazz chords at :26 and keeping it up for a good thirty seconds.  And that sound!  Lesh's solo starts nicely, beginning around 7:30.  This whole thing is so well played.  Garcia is really stunning (best Eyes ever, hmmm, I'm still thinking about the 5-15-77 Eyes and Garcia's \"search for ecstasy\" there starting at 11:44).  Quality sound and performance on par with the '75 Great American Music Hall. \n\nThere are many fun moments.  Listen to Lesh chiming in on the \"my back door\" verse during China Cat.  Near the end of I Know You Rider, about 3:52, Garcia catches his breath for two or three notes, then zooms off on a stunning ascending run. \n\nThe slower tunes are gorgeous.  Ship of Fools has Keith's churchy, electric piano sound, and lots of loud, loping lines from Lesh.  China Doll, again, what an incredible sound.  Garcia solos with a fuzzy feedback that reminds me of his breaks on If I Had The World To Give.\n\nTruckin', Garcia starts phrasing at 5:13 and just never stops, a really incredible run of articulate thoughts and excitement.\n\nThanks for making this recording available.

Better, imho, than 6-16 or 6-18 of same week.  (But I don't think you'll ever find 3 Eyes in a 7 day stretch as good as these three mentioned - lol!)

I was so high both in locale and otherwise that I freaked out over the tiny size of the steps and how steep they were.  I thought I was going to fly out of there though after they closed with One More Saturday Night!! What a great memory this is...",

The auditorium now houses the administrative offices for Georgia State University, and the GD did play there in 71. Omni show listings indicate that this show occurred there in 1974. One reviewer below  makes a reference to the Omni, which was not the municipal auditorium.",

      "review_text": "discovering gold...   AGAIN! I've listened to this show probably 3-4 times over the years, but something about this time made me realize just how good this show actually is.   On many songs, the band just doesn't sound like they're in that much of a hurry --- very relaxed, yet still giving the right amount of UMPHF where it counts.   \n\nThe meat of the 2nd set is where the real gold is.   Truckin' into EOTW --- again, there's a mellowness to the performance, but Jerry & Phil both seem to be putting just the right notes in just the right place.   It is a short show for '74, but still has enough X-Factor to make you realize --AGAIN-- why you listen to the GD.",

      "review_text": "Good Show.  Great Sound. This is a good, but rather short show.  Relaxed with good energy as stated below. The thing that helps boost it to above average is the great board.  Billy, Keith, and Phil are prominent.  The most notable quality is that the high end is saturated and it\u2019s a bit tinny.  But it\u2019s not a problem if you have editing software and can add allot of bass, which mellows out the sound considerably.  With the usual reverb addition to also soften the sterility, you get a great sound.  Bobby, Jerry, and Donna sound good tonight with well balanced mics which is a big, big plus!  Phil is funny on IKYR.  His singing is very high in some spots, and he actually sounds good.  Per Dr. Unclear, the first set is fairly unremarkable.  But it\u2019s still a well played set nonetheless.  Only one of three U.S. Blues openings of the pre-coma era. \n\nFun Big River opening the second set which is another very rare treat.  I agree with everybody that the Truckin\u2019 > Jam > Eyes > is nice with the unusual, energetic first Slipknot! to follow.  DBX has Slipknot! listed.  DBV does not.  I also agree with Will Shine on the \u201changing.\u201d There probably was a Sugar Magnolia after China Doll.  Maybe the reel ran out? I can appreciate the comment that this Omni show has been overlooked being sandwiched between a few other notables.  But it\u2019s still very collectible with the aforementioned edits.",

I was in the 5th grade at that time. A year later I saw ACDC play at the Omni. AND then a load of other shows at the Omni & the Fox Theatre. I never heard of \"The Atlanta Municipal Auditorium\". \nWhether this is just mislabeled or what I'm not sure. My first Dead Show was at the Omni in 1987. \nBut anyway, I'm supposed to be reviewing what I've heard here and well everything I listened to I thoroughly enjoyed!! Scarlet Begonias is really good, especially being played as a stand alone \nsong here. This show idk, it's different from a lot of others but in a really good way.  China/Rider is normal. But Truckin gets really weird. A really good kinda weird as though it's \"Space\" with the drums still playing. \nAND \"Eyes of the World\"> \"Slipknot\"> \"China Doll\" is just wonderful. It goes from this beautiful free flowing \"Eyes\" into the 'Slpknot\" where it gets weird. And then starts picking up some steam again and then this really gorgeous \"China Doll\" starts.\nI really LOVE THE WAY Jerry sings the LALALALALALALA....AND \nTHEN plays the same notes with the guitar. AND then repeats with the whole band doing the lalalalalalala & then the instruments play the same. It's an excellent effect and very beautiful!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 1974, the old Municipal Auditorium at Gilmer and Courtland Streets was a common venue for music. The Omni came online only two years before, and both venues were used during that period. MA was smaller. I'd guess capacity including floor seating was maybe 10,000. With the WOS in that building, the acoustics were exceptional. Jerry was clean shaven\u2013 just a stubble. Since 1979, Municipal Auditorium has been Georgia State University's Alumni Hall.",

Flourishing, roaring, rattling, howling, thundering. Kicking, melting, raining, storming, screaming. This thing is smoking out of every skin pore. Peaking notes all over the place. Fresh earieness. Hot cooking music soup. The cherry on top is Slipknot! It's a mix out of Eyes and Slipknot. HOLY Macaroni is that hot!! People are screaming in joy and me too hahaha ",
