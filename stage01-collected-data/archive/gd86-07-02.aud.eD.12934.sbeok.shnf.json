Different vibe...easy in hind site to see why...Alpine Valley vs. the Akron Rubberbowl...although it had a little charm, it was still the Akron Rubberbowl...a good portion of the crowd was obviously there for Tom Petty and Dylan, and not the GD.  Not that they were assholes or anything, it's just that I enjoy shows more with Deadheads than your ordinary concert goers...\n\nThis show is notable for what I believe to be the first onstage collaboration between the Dead and Dylan.  He came out for LRR, and then sang Don't Think Twice...and then he and Jerry proceeded to butcher Baby Blue...oh well.  It was another off night for Jerry if I recall...which I just barely do.  I haven't downloaded this yet...but I will...someday...",

This is when his body was getting ready to go into serious trouble so I really don't blame the guy but they should have taken a break to let him get better.  I remember seeing him going up the steps to the stage, looked like he was climbing Mt. Everest.\n\nAnyway sub par 1st set only to get worse in the 2nd set.  I know this was the 1st collaboration but as many Dead spot light moments go (Monteray, Woodstock) they can be huge disappointments.  This was when Dylan was still in cruise control living off of TP and the Heart Breakers so he did not help.  It was so bad that Jerry just up and left the stage during Desolation Row because he was so spent.",

It's the only show I was at that I won't be burning.It was way too hot and Jerry was in trouble as already mentioned above. I also concur that Dylan didn't help. I've played my tapes maybe 10 times in the last 18 years. I always cringe during Baby Blue. Oh well, they can't all be perfect can they?",

Yea Jerry leaves so you dont get his pattened guitar riffs but the rest of the band really pulls it off remarkably.  Lesh is dancing around while bobby belts lyrics left and right.  Plus in replace of the trademark Jerry solo Brent shines on the B-3....great improv and nice to see the rest of the guys pull this off. The PLayin>Desolation>Drums...could be a potential filler! JF",

It was hot, and I'm sure it was on stage  for the musicians, so I remember not stellar performances in the heat of the afternoon sun, but the Dead performed the best out of all there that day. It was Dylan, Petty, and the Dead.  By the time the Dead went on stage, the sun was going down, and people's spirits were high.  This was a giant stadium show, and that's what it sounds like.  I remember getting up close to see Dylan, and he looked sweaty and drunk, but he was pulling off the riffs on the guitar rather well.  I think the Dead were riding high on a wave of stardom here as their first studio recording in years was actually getting airplay on radio, and Dylan had come back from years of seclusion.  I had just graduated from highschool, and about a dozen friends of mine drove the 45 minutes over to the rubber bowl. Lots of A taken. I also remember lots of traffic, and buying a Chillum in the parking lot.  Never had such a good time!  Well, the show may not be the best, but a happy and interesting time for the band.",

There are a couple of high points in the show but the first set was ruined when they TRIED to play baby blue with dylan and it never got better after that.  The second set opener of china rider was nice but could not make up for a very lame show.",

Taping was not allowed at the Dylan shows & I nervously set up directly in front of the board which was perched on top of 6'or 8' of scaffolding. Halfway thru Drums a huge Af.American security guard tapped me on the shoulder and said \"Give me those mics\" I handed them to him and to my amazement he duct-taped them to the railing on top of the platform. I thanked him for being cool after the show and asked him how he liked it. \"Not too much, but the drums were OK-I don't really understand any of this.\"  The next night I got thrown out of Rich Stadium along with a dozen or so other tapers FOB sometime during Space. They confiscated the tapes (I gave them blanks) and led us outside.",

The sound of this recording ain't bad for an aud though. I am a live music nut but I prefer Bob Dylan's studio stuff way more. He is terrible live and just keeps getting worse(IMO). I've got some his live shows from 1965 through 1976. They are good.",

So even though looking back we knew Jerry must have been hurting, I don't blame him for leaving during this tune.He probably figured it would go on for 15 minutes and nothing worthwhile would happen so he went to get high!\n\nDylan is horrible as usual!!",

      "review_text": "exausted from the tour After Alpine we were so stretched out.  I mean we were going gonzo there.  Then the drive that night to Cinci was scary as all get go.  We were falling asleep despite the wicked buzz.  I don't remember much at all of cinci except post drums.  Then we went to Akron.  A big wide open place with airplanes flying in and out the airport behind the stage.  I have very little memory of the TP/BD set.  The Dead were uninspiring.  It was not just my state of mind, others were like that was no show to write home about.  I don't remember Jerry leaving the stage during Desolation Bob.  I've had other shows where I was 50% or less and could tell if the show was good.  The sound was hard to hear from the stands.  The planes flying about were distracting me.  And yes, We thought there was something wrong with Jerry.  He was not looking like he was interested in his work that day.  Maybe it was our seats being further away that I am used to.  I like to have my elbows on the rail, not dancing on the lawn.  Normally, I would have fight my way to the stage.  No security ever stopped me ever.  I was tired.  Anyway, This was the most unmemorable show I ever saw.  Except I got to see Bob Dylan.  Who was not very entertaining.  He had a way of not being interesting at all back then.  It was tough for me.  I LOVE Bob Dylan.  He got a good band later in the 80's that could be consistent.  \nSorry if my review is less than stellar, but it is what I experienced at the Akron Rubber Bowl.  I never got the tape.  Never gave it a second thought.  This was the only show of my triple digits seeing the Dead that left me apathetic.  The music always lifted me.  Not at Akron.  I think the Chinacat/Rider was the only thing I remember being good.  But, even that was kind of diluted.  We gave up on the tour here.  It was getting too difficult for us.  Tours were monumental undertakings.  Never did a whole one in 17 years of seeing them.  \nUptown Theater '78 thru Soldier's Field '95, what a ride, and still on the chase for more, because... It is so much fun!  ",
