One of the better versions of \"Roses\". Jerry sounds like he means it.\nSecond set starts with the best \"Sampson\" ever. I don't even like Sampson. But Jerry wails like his guitar is a sax, and just won't stop soloing   and Phil is all over the bass.\nShip of Fools is not a throwaway, Jerry commands and demands your attention. You will listen.\nEstimated has another long wailing solo that won't quit. Makes it feel 75 and sunny when you're frozen to your igloo. I could say great things about all of the other tunes in this show starting with \"The Other One\" (except fot \"Terrapin\", THE ONLY low point, if you could call it that). This show has Jerry in commanding top form, and the whole band is listening to eachother nonstop. Get it!!",

      "review_text": "Red Rocks 7-08-78 Numero Uno This is, far and away, my favorite Grateful Dead tape/CD.  I first listened to this tape in the Fall of 1979 while a third year at UVa.  I'm pretty sure we were on the way to a Molly Hatchet/Outlaws concert at the Cap Centre in Landover, Md.  Anyway, I had sworn my allegiance to hard rock and disavowed any partiality at all for the Dead, even though the guys I hung around seemed to consist of quite a number of Dead Heads.\n\nI think we listened to the 2nd set of this concert continuously on the way home from that concert.  What struck me then and still strikes me today is the enormous energy level present in the 2nd set.  But let's start at the beginning.\n\nSet 1 begins innocently enough with a Bertha-> Good Lovin' romp, which is spot on.  Two \"cowboy songs\" follow -- first Jerry enjoys a fairly rare electric Direwolf, followed by one of my favorites in this genre -- El Paso.  One thing I'll say about the Direwolf is that if you listen to Donna you can kind of understand why they cut the Godchaux's (keyboard player Keith and wife, background vocalist Donna) loose from the ensemble around this time as she is pretty much off key throughout.  One thing I'll say about El Paso is if you listen to Jerry's lead guitar on this one, you get a sense that he is \"on\" this particular evening.\n\nTwo rare \"roses\" songs (It Must Have Been the Roses and Ramble on Rose) sandwich a New Minglewood Blues in the middle of Set 1.  They end with a pretty common pair: Promised Land and Deal, but the two don't really connect, as Deal pretty much starts from scratch at the conclusion of Promised Land.\n\nSet 2 opens with Samson & Delilah and another favorite that you don't hear that much -- Ship of Fools.  So far this concert hasn't really distinguished itself -- I won't say pedestrian, as the playing and singing has certainly been fine so far.  And the song selection has included a few treats.  But starting with Estimated Prophet, the 2nd set of this show basically takes on a life of it's own.  A high energy, rock & roll romp that really defies the senses.  Never again after listening to this set would I think of the Dead as anything other than a great, great, great American rock & roll band.  \n\nEstimated segues into The Other One, which is not long, but rolls along with Lesh and Jerry leading the way.  The transition into Eyes of the World is amazing.  Jerry is on a roll. This version of Eyes is a favorite of mine.  It rivals the 9/3/77 Englishtown, NJ version featured on Dick's Picks #15 in intensity as Jerry alternately transitions from chopping to floating in butterfly-like fashion during the lead jams.  The folks in attendance must have certainly felt as if they were getting their money's worth at this point!!\n\nDrums and space (I have been known to omit drums/space to the horror of some taper friends of mine) is nice and compact this evening, lasting about 14 minutes.  At the end of the space, Donna adds some nice background vocals to the proceedings. The space transitions into an absolutely breathtaking version of Wharf Rat.  Wharf Rat is my favorite Dead song, and this is my favorite version -- hands down.   It is unlike any other version of Wharf Rat that exists -- very unique.  It's a rather hard rock version of this Robert Hunter-penned ballad.  Jerry's \"Ssshhh\"  in the middle of the \"back on my feet someday\" refrain is priceless!  The transition from Wharf Rat to Frankin's Tower (the only time I know of that these two standards have been paired up?) is exciting, and the Franklin's Tower is a raging jam throughout.  It was not often that the Dead pulled out Franklin's Tower AFTER drums/space.  Beautiful guitar work by Jerry.  It should be noted that Bob Weir lays down exquisite rhythm throughout this set as well.  Sugar Magnolia is another delight.  Again, very high energy.  The energy peaks as they finish off with the Sunshine Daydream portion of the tune and the loud finish is appropriate for the best, hard-rocking Dead that exists -- at least in the post \"retirement\" (1974-75) era.  \n\nPerhaps realizing that they somewhat shortened the post-drums/space portion of the show, or perhaps nor knowing what else to play after that incredible Rat -> F Tower -> Sugar Mag sequence, the group decides to do a rare Terrapin encore.  Even the volume seems lower for this epic tune.  The energy soon returns as the encore turns into a double encore (usually reserved for special occasions) segueing into One More Saturday Night where the entire band just basically goes off for five minutes straight.  Not quite done yet, they answer a second curtain call with the then-popular Warren Zevon tune Werewolves of London.  You can tell they are having a good time doing this tune.   Disc 3 of this set needs to be listened with rapt attention and at maximum possible volume!  Enjoy!!",

I wandered around for this show and ended up at one point arm-in-arm with a group of strangers, singing along with them on Ship of Fools.  There was a considerable break before the Terrapin encore, with the promoter (Barry Fey?) coming out to tell us to relax while the band literally caught its breath, unaccustomed as they were to the altitude.  There was a shorter break before Werewolves of London, and I still swear that at least Weir came back out wearing a mask.\n\nIf only such nights would come again...",

Set One was a time for the band to warm up, and for the audience to spread their blankets, distribute the goodies, go to the WC, etc.   Songs were there simply as a starting point, \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" could have the most amazing improvisational jamming, while \"Dark Star\" could be a perfunctory bridge to some other song.\n\nIt sounds like some people were looking for the Rolling Stones or something - hearing those studio songs in a live setting ??\n\nNow, on to this show.   Back 30 years ago, Deadheads looked at the tour announcements and stayed away from any show on Saturday night.  It was well known that automatically meant a \"date night concert\", and the Dead would play all the standards in a boring way that would please Average Joe who had heard Truckin on the radio and wanted a concert to go to with his date.\n\nAfter I listened through the hours of uninspired perfunctory performances of this show, I made a mental note to do a web search for \"1978 Calendar\" and sure enough, this show was Saturday Night.\n\nThe one description of this show I can give that describes it best is that it sounds like a Dead Cover Band.   This is clearest when they start singing \"St Stephen\" and it comes out like \"St Stephen - hey remember that classic from our younger days - I bet you do - hey wow it's St Stephen, okay ?\" It seems unbelievably self conscious and self-referential.\n\nWhat is a little frightening is the guy who uses this as a \"conversion tape\"!   Before reading that, I was thinking this show would be the sort of show that confirms people's impressions that the GD were a \"laid back cowboy western band for stoners\".\n\nI've attended as many shows as possible between 1974 and 1989 and so attended many more shows after 1975.\n\nHowever, listening to this show confirms my decision to only download shows before 1976.\n\nPlease NOTE:  This is music, it is very subjective, and this is my opinion only - if you enjoy this show, that's a positive thing - please continue to do so.\n\n... but please give people \"One From The Vault\" as a \"conversion tape\", not this one!  :) :)",

Recording quality is terrific, the set list is phenomenal, and Jerry is ON in a big way for both vocals and lead.  EVERY TUNE shines with extra effort on his part.  And the band is having as much fun as the audience.  I can't imagine that you won't find yourself smiling and laughing along as you listen...  ENJOY!!!\n\nBtw, an extra note regarding the night before (7/7/78): just finished giving it a thorough listening, and IT IS JUST AS KILLER a show for the same aforementioned reasons!!  IMHO, the two shows combine for one of the best runs I've ever heard (and the other reviews seem to be in full agreement).  Quite a few people may have been put off by the \"splitter technique\" note in the recording notes or by a relatively simplistic set list; DO NOT MISS OUT ON DOWNLOADING BOTH OF THESE SHOWS!  Just wait until you hear the first night if you haven't already...  TURN UP THE VOLUME FOR FULL EFFECT! \n\n**(Responding to the very negative review from \"A Dude\": yes, every fan has their favorite years and their own subjective standards for what comprises a 5-star Dead show and is more than welcome to voice their opinion.  But anyone considering AGAINST downloading this show would be well advised to make an informed decision and peruse ALL of the previous reviews for this show!)**",

It's all about the delivery, and boy do the Dead deliver. Jerry's vocals are especially impassioned. Check out Ship Of Fools, he goes for the jugular. Jerry isn't the only one singing with abandon, Donna forgets to use her \"indoor\" voice on several occasions (youch) and emotionally Bobby's right with her and Jerry. It's not just about the vocals though,  Jerry's guitar lines dance in the Estimated> Other One> Eyes and soar during Wharf Rat. Phil, Bobby et al are dancing and soaring right along too with the Grateful Dead group mind very much in evidence. The more I listen the better it gets. Though I can't say this show is my favorite of '78, that may be either be 4/12 or 1/22 and the Dick's Picks Vol. 18 pastiche of 2/03 and 2/05.

After they revived it in 76' with Bob on lead vocals, the 76-77 versions generally have the original instrumental lead in jam from the old days. As 78' came in, the band phased out the intro jam sans a new arrangement, to make the song poppy like Bob's version turned into. \n\nDespite this show being well after they generally abandoned the intro jam, Phil seems inspired (hey, what musician wouldn't be playing at Red Rocks?) and nostalgic and brings back the intro jam on a heavy bass-wrought lead. Bob is not having it, he tries to segue into the vocals at least twice before Phil allows the song to continue. Lots of little surprises and extra effort would become commonplace of the boy's Red Rocks performances, but this two day run, their first at the Rocks, is so damn well played.  We already know this however, so i just thought i'd share that funny observation.",

I listened to these 2 Red Rocks shows after reading in numerous places that these were among the best, if not THE best, shows of 1978. I must say in this case the hype is actually deserved. I haven't really been too impressed with most of the 1978 I've heard (anyone got any good suggestions?) but Jerry is just redonkuluous this evening. His guitar just sings all night and even though his voice has sounded better on many a night, damn if he doesn't give it 110% on the vocals this night. It's almost like he's singing extra hard on some tracks because he knows his voice is a little off, or something. Can someone tell me when Keith's supposed \"de-evolution\" starts taking place? Because he is sick on this show, really on fire. I've read that towards the end of his time with The Dead that Keith began going totally downhill. If that's true I haven't heard that show yet, because Keith & Jerry still sound good together here. The 1st set is all good songs and each one extremely well-played. This 2nd set has to be one of the top-5 of this year. Just incredible. The jamming from Estimated all the way through Sugar Magnolia is too good for words, honestly I can't even describe it. I have both this and 7/7 if someone wants to do a B&P or trade hit a brotha up.",

We have a son and life is good. We move to Yellow Springs, Ohio after living up in Asheville, N.C. \nAs soon as we get to Ohio find out she has a malignant brain tumor. (We didn't get it at the time but basically a death sentence.)\nSo who comes along but a man of God who proclaims the Gospel to me. He preaches Christ and Him crucified. Still groking with the total implications of that news when planes start crashing into the Twin Towers.\nStrange thing about all this was the Preacher took me into his home and his life. We went around Ohio as he preached in small churches around the State.\nI don't know how many of you have read the Bible but book of the Law (Torah) is near impossible to keep and Jesus comes and raises the bar even higher.\nWell, with everything going on in the world both personal and international. and me reading a Book that was like a mirror showing me all of my shortcomings and flaws.\nAlso raising a 3 year old without his mother and my wife.\nI laid it on the line. Jesus, I am at the end of my rope here. Please, help me.\nI can't say life got any better for a long time. \nAnd i have learned that circumstances change. \nLife is what happens while we were busy making plans.\nI use to think I chose Jesus and really that is what many of the church crowd believes they made a decision for Jesus.\nBut when I look back I can see how The Almighty loved me even when i was at the bottom.\nYou know if nobody ever died .\nI guess we could just go on living our lives\n like this for eternity \nbut the Bible says \"It is appointed for a man once to die, and then comes the judgment\"\n So i would hope everyone will consider that each of us has to give an account. ie-Reckoning\nScripture says if we go to the grave without Jesus then we are lost. There is no payment for the debt owed to a Holy GOD. It is a terrible prospect and it is the fate of so many.\nYet, if we believe Christ and His claim to have paid the debt for our sin then we will spend eternity in heaven.\nWe will still give an account of our lives \nbut our trespasses are forgiven. (Nothing but the blood)\nAnyway, lots of missionaries out there going to and fro all over the earth. bringing this message.\nSo I want to share this with whoever might hear.\nCause GOD does look down on the boys in the barroom\nThanks-Chris Freedom\nI finished that right at \"I know that the life I am living is no good.\"\nVery powerful Wharf Rat the band is hanging on Garcia's lyrics during the quiet part of the song.\nWow, what a place for Franklin's! \nAlways liked this tune especially after drums.\nI remember they did that on Dead Set/ Radio City\nOh what a great transition into Sugar Magnolia.\nDancin fools a mile high!\n3 encores.
