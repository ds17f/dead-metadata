Overall, it's an excellent recording of a handsomely-played first half. \n\nThe boys could do no wrong: if they attempted a run up the middle it would get major yardage, if they passed they got even larger chunks, but, even when they punted the ball over to Bruce and Vince the ball ended up in Jerry's hands and recovered for a touchdown, err...goal.\n\nSome lady offhandedly asked out loud what they played at Wembley (meaning; what setlist did the Grateful Dead perform) and another person overheard and said, \"They play football here, madam.\"\n\nAnyway, she was talking American football and he was talking what we Yanks call \"Soccer.\"\n\nSubsequently, a misunderstanding brewed, a brawl sparked and mayhem ensued. A mayhem dubbed \"the Second Half\".\n\nYou got yer Scarlet Fire, yer Truckin, and yer Gone. Jerry is just all over it. The band is in-synch ~ even Phil sings.\n\nAll of the rest of this show is well-scripted and choreographed and played to the hilt with the obligatory Werewolves thrown in. Ho hum on that, but bravo to the in-between.\n\nThere are so many great shows in this Bruce and Vince age that it becomes an arduous task to even to begin to discriminate as to which show is kingpin and which isn't.\n\nForget analyzing. After all, this effort surely must forego the anal exam and stand on its own two feat. Just sit back and enjoy ~ It's just another football game. Yeah, right!",

Attended all three shows, one of the Hilites of my 15 year GD Long Strange Trip experience (Jerry in the Redshirt Oakland 2-85; 20th anniversary; 6 NYE's just to name a few others) Scene outside was a disappointment tho - Ugly Americans - caused me and my bud to get inside late; missed the Help>Slip>Franklin's. Still managed to locate my spot, five rows back in front of the Big Guy.\nThird show was equally good. Really wanted that SOTM, but Jerry changed his mind - he was entitled to do so. \nAfter the 3rd show I spoke with kid behind me, he'd seen the whole tour. HE was a disappointment. His words,\"It kind of sux when they play Dark Star like five times on the tour.\" Huh? Unappreciative, or just spoiled rotten? I couldn't figure that one out.\nThere were no bad shows except one - Donner Summit - and that was only because Bobby's amp malfunctioned. And further more I just want to say no matter how many shows you seen - be it 1 or 2100 - we ALL saw the same amount - not enough. So appreciate what we got.\nThe Fat Man Rocks\nThank You Jerry\nKnow Our Love Will Not Fade Away.",

Not to discount this show, in the massive Wembley Stadium. They played to the corners. After selling out Wembley two nights, an extra show was added for the next night. That's a long way from playing a West End theater in '72 (or the Ally Pally in '74). The 1st Paris show from a few days earlier has greater renown, but it does seem like the boys were into playing the great Wembley, and there are great versions sprinkled through the three nights. This is a Hornsby, 7-man show (the slick two-keys era), and the first of two Halloweens with Bruce (also the final two played).  \n\nFirst Set. You can't hear Phil well on <i>Help on the Way</i> and the percussion is not well-balanced for a '90, but the playing is stadium-sized out the gate. They are here to give notice beyond NW London. The <i>Franklin's</i> is fully explored. <i>Little Red Rooster</i> is pwned by Bruce and tight (though not particularly adventurous).  The rest of the set is above average. <i>Must Have Been Roses</i> ain't half bad in its dual-keys version. Bruce switches to accordion for <i>Masterpiece</i>. Jer starts losing his voice on the bottom of the set, but <i>Bird Song</i> has the brio to satisfy. Vince is good on <i>Promised Land</i>. Like much of '90, played like pros, but with little fireworks...and with 80,000 people.\n\nSecond Set. A 1hr45min set gives the punters their money's worth. <i>Scarlet</i> has a cut of a several seconds at the beginning (try the matrix). Like Help on the Way, it got even better on a second listen. And don't forget: Grosvenor Square is actually nearby (maybe somebody had a chance to go walking around). The jam into and including <i>Fire</i> is even better. Jer pushes them abruptly into Fire, just leaving it all onstage (from 1:05>2:53 of Fire is on <b>Backstage Pass</b>, during the end credits).  Bobby can't, for the life of him, recall the lyric order on <i>Truckin'. Drums>Space</i> isn't a particularly stadium-sized version, but the hot <i>Watchtower</i> definitely is. Jer leaves is all onstage again for <i>Stella</i>, but nobody takes the ball and heads down pitch for <i>Around & Around</i>. By <i>Good Lovin'</i> Bobby is drama-squelching (weird balance issues on the SBD). The beginning of obvious pick <i>Werewolves of London</i> was clipped in the concert itself, but the SBD also has a couple dropouts at the start. The AUDs have the beginning as heard. It's not as good as the next year, but not bad as far as these game attempts go.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3 stars\n\nHighlights:\nHelp on the Way>Slipknot!>Franklin's Tower - what a start, and Jer squeezes as much as he can\nScarlet Begonias>Fire on the Mountain - the latter is an especially good version\n\nSOURCES: The ladner_8070 is the best SBD. The best AUD is the houck-wright_gmb_90844, though it runs fast, <u>needing -1.5% pitch correction</u>. The others are muffled on the highs or thumpy. D. Usborne made a great matrix (125745 mtx_dusborne), which is the best choice for both the beginning of Scarlet and the correct Drums>Space [without repeated section]. The show is usually up on YouTube - or more accurately, footage of Jer from this show. Part of Scarlet>Fire was officially released on the <b>Backstage Pass</b> vid.",

Not a bad venue, sound is a bit cavernous unless you're on the floor area. Pretty good show - Help>Slip>Franklin's and Scarlet>Fire together was kinda special. I saw this one and the next night...which was the final show of the tour and one of the best. ",
