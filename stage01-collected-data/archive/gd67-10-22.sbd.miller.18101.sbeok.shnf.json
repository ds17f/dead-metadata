The Lovelights is an amazingly energetic performance by Pigpen with a basic early jam. \n\nThis is one of the first performances of Other One with the story included of being busted by the heat for smiling on a sunny day. This refers to Bobby dropping a water balloon on a cops head from the third floor, after being busted earlier in the month for pot being in 710 - the Dead's home. Sound is good for this year.",

If you don't believe me then why do you think this show was as awesome as it sounds. I'm talking about a future event that will happen where I do that and send the dead all of this incredible energy.

There's a lot of great jamming, especially in the Lovelight (despite the cut), New Potato, and the That's it suite.\n\nSpeaking of that, the first-known performance of the That's It suite is a monster and is worth the download alone. It's a bit tentative in spots, especially Bobby's early lyrics about being taught things and heads not in sight, but it's 14:49 of pure energy that no Deadhead can be without.",

Not only high energy, but like the 1977 shows, tight \u2013 the band is playing together and without sloppiness, and all the vocals and harmonies are on target. Bob is good on Beat It, which wasn\u2019t always the case during this period. Mickey Hart had only been playing with the Dead for a few weeks, but he and Bill are working smoothly together. (September 29 was Mickey\u2019s first show.)\n\nThey start with a solid Morning Dew, followed by a great new Potato Caboose, which features not only a firey Jerry, but a Jerry and Phil counterpoint, with, Phil following Jerry\u2019s lead. Listen to Phil here. Beat It and Cold Rain and Snow were \u201coldies\u201d for them, having played it most of 1966, and they sound polished here. \n\nAnother oldie is It Hurts Me Too back, and Pigpen shows his master of the blues.  Lovelight is gives us more  high-energy Jerry, the usual great vocal and rap from Pigpen--the best vocalist the Dead ever had. Unfortunately, it\u2019s cut off as things are getting going after a calm period.\n\nThe electric Jerry we hear on New Potato is also featured in Cryptical/Other One, which they had only recently started playing, when they hadn\u2019t settled on the lyrics. There were also rehearsing it in the studio for the Anthem of the Sun, and it\u2019s a crisp, freeform performance. It\u2019s also an ensemble effort, lead by Jerry. Phil is great here as well. It simply smokes and is the highly of the show. \n\nBy this time the Dead had completed the reinvention of themselves from the Beatles pop/blues of 1966 to the unique psychedelia that proved the creative chops. It was one of several transformations they made over the years. The New Potato and Cryptical/Other One exemplify the psychedelic Dead, and are worth multiple listens. The psychedelic Dead isn\u2019t just space\u2014in fact, it\u2019s mostly not space. It has underlying form and structure (with defined movements) and is melodic. I like the repetitive licks Jerry uses towards the end \u2013 the have a trance-inducing quality of the raves of the 1990\u2019s \u2013the Dead were all about Dance music, and they said so at the time and later.\n\nThe audio is great, with all of the instruments audible.",

      "review_text": "date???? I was just trying to cross reference some info, and dead.net has no indication of a show occuring on 10.22.67.  Dead.net lists a Winterland on Halloween 10.31.67, but with no setlist to compare. Also, the previous show noted is 10.14.67 at The Continental Ballroom in Santa Clara.  If someone knows the particular facts you should update dead.net or make an adjustment here.  \nI specifically love the years '67-'68,'73-74,'76-'77, '80-'81, '90-'91 and can't get enough of GD's propensity to evolve and this show classic represents that in stellar form*! \n\n*I make this notation because The Grateful \"Goddamn\" Dead was better than any band at creating a new canvas and evolving from small mistakes or outright poor shows, as well. 4 stars because of the \"Lovelight\" cut.  Sorry to sound perfectionistic, but with so many flawless recordings out there I save the 5 stars for those particular shows.  (ie. another '67, Winterland from March 18th).",

      "review_text": "back to business & pleasure. this recording, to me, represents a milestone achieved within the Grateful Dead contingency. I try to imagine the excitement of this era in their new found \"wings\"; Jerry's solo almost outpacing the band (lsd induced) and setting the tone for some of the turning points within the frame-work of the jam. However wonderful these moments are I can still hear a splitting of priorities of the jam from Pig, Bob, Jerry & Phil. How, you may ask? Because the song selection has lent the idea that Pig can only work his magic when the song comes back together- he fits in for the moment and then settles back into his organ (which, by the way, sounds hauntingly funeralistic at times) & he seems awkward in the delivery of his respective part to gel the formula Jerry & Phil are laying down; Bob sounds as though his confidence is building;(it may be me,but) he has always had a knack for keeping the vocal together even in the biggest screw-ups, like he anticipates(instinctively)& accepts the nature of his role within the jam too. I do believe the forces or the glue holding the whole furious thing together lies in Bill's pliability; he may be one of the craziest drummers to sit on the hot seat. This performance is mediocre at best, but brilliant because some new tools are being implemented & the hat has tricks in it that show them to be better than the average rock band-mediocrity aside. To bring a new member into the band at this point, is brave & maybe even a bit rash; but, no real progress was ever made without taking risks, so, Mickey will be the enforcer to Bill's domain(which still seems odd). \nI'm not nitt-picking-I only want to give my take(opinion) on a band I've mostly experienced by recording. I've experienced the Dead only within the last 15 years & saw them in '93 & '94 & then after that it was all the incarnations of a scene mostly of fans trying to keep the fire lit, boy, what a scene.",

New Potato is one of my favorites. They were miles ahead of everyone else. My only disappointment with this show is the cut off of Lovelight, sounds like they were going into Alligator? Damn wish I had been there. Born 22 years too late. Nonetheless love listening to it now. Everyone at work thinks i'm weird, they don't understand. I've loved the Dead ever since my sister turned me on to them when I was 12 but only recently have I started listening to these shows. Now, studio music has no hold for me. What the Dead did is beyond compare.",
