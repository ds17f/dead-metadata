That's one song the band still could sink their teeth into right after the layoff.    \n\nSound quality 5 stars.  Although this is one of the best June '76 shows (imo), the best shows in '76 are from Sept.-Oct., so I rate the performance at 4 stars.",

Great sound overall, no noticable problems, and it's so Crispy!!!!\nyou can really pick out keith during this show especially in the intro of samson &delilah, which is a great jazzy version...the wheel played before this is a nice solid mellow version with a hot little jam before the close..playin is nice and long and charges hard into the final verse with a bang! (i'm reviewing the songs backwards sorry). an inspired high time continues a solid set II that includes only the second cosmic charlie since 71 (the other on 6/4/76).\n\nthe help>slip>franklins is mesmerizing!!! you forget where you are during this sequence!!!! In my opinion one of the best improvisational jams of the entire year!!!!!!\n\nyou need this 76' in your collection!!!!! 5 for quality! 4 for the show itself...i don't like giving 5's out....\n\nIn my top 3 for the year!!!",

And I'm never disappointed. The first few shows of the year sound a little rusty in spots, and understandably so with the the year off from touring. But by mid June, they had re-discovered the magic groove, and this show is a testament to that fact.\nNot only were they experimenting with some new sounds and styles in 1976, they also started to offer some interesting set lists - mixing newer songs with old favorites from the earlier days like Cosmic Charlie, High Time and Cold Rain. Here we get a fine mix of those songs, plus new additions like Lazy Lightning and Cassidy.\nThe Playin is full of tasty jamming by all, plus some fine inter-drumming between Bill and Mickey.\n\nSet Two starts with The Wheel, rare and a good omen! Then we get a stellar version of Crazy Fingers that approaches Dark Star territory at times. And what hot versions of Music and Dancin! You'll be hard pressed to find better ones in 76.\n\nEveryone seems to like the 6/3 version of Help>Slipknot, and I'll admit I haven't yet heard the 6/10 offering (next show on my list). But this version is tops in my book. Slower than 1977 versions, but at over 17 minutes, very inspired and unique, with great counterpoint jamming between Phil and Jerry.\nThis show often ranks 2nd for the year in Deadbase, listen and you'll see why! A sparkling SBD that will make you feel you're on stage with the band. Heartily recommended!\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

What other band do you know of has so many different sound philosophies throughout their career? Not many even come close and that is one of the reasons why we of the DeadHead fold love this band with such devotion and seemingly never tire of listening to them!\nThis Beacon Theater show is a prime example of what the Grateful Dead were all about in 1976, a year that sometimes gets overlooked or at least under-valued due to its linear proximity to the banner year of 1977. But without this year of musical exploration and material development, none of that would have happened...right?\nFor some time I kept this June 14th show in the back of my mind, having some of it and most of the other Beacon shows already but still knowing some day I would need to download the entire show to hear what it had to offer. Well, how could I not download this show first? How could I have waited for over a year to get it all? Perhaps it was my blind preference to 1977 and other great years such as 1968 through 1974. Whatever the reason, all I can say is that I'm glad to finally have this great show and I want to talk about just one song...\nIs this the best version of Crazy Fingers? Maybe, maybe not. All I know is Garcia still can sing it here in '76. It was subsequently dropped for an incredibly long time until its re-visitation in '82. Yet, Crazy Fingers was never the same. It never achieved the fluidity and grace that it had here, unfortunately. The instrumental jam at the end is so hypnotic, isn't it? Anyway, that's just one song here and all the songs could be analysed for their given merit but let yourself be the judge. Get this show and find out.\nOn top of the fact that this is a wonderful show, the sound here is primo too!",

The set really begins at CRAZY FINGERS which is beautiful with a stunning outro that has a different seque into DANCIN.  This version is very large and upbeat.  COSMIC CHARLIE wants to steal the show and almost does, it is an upbeat version with everyone present and beautiful leads.  They tune up for the next set of songs and we are glad they do.  Phil takes the lead into HELP ON THE WAY and everyone lets him as they all join in.  SLIPKNOT! is always a favorite for me and this one does not dissapoint.  Starting off very exploratory, devolving into its drums/space-ness that it has want to do - they go to some real primordial places here for sure.  It gets down to just Jerry and the drummers then Phil joins in with some sublime Leshy Phil-o-drama.  The experimentation goes on until Bobby brings the rythm back and they all come back to the surface to run and dance on top for awhile.  This starts to sound a little like the Dark Stars of '69.  Really.  They all finally find a common vector in the universe to meet at so they can bubble into FRANKLIN'S TOWER.  This is a really fine transition too.  Too bad it goes into a very so-so FRANKLIN'S.  The playing is good but they've lost the mojo they had and can't seem to concentrate.  AROUND is not sounding stellar but still nice.  Jerry is confused and tries to get fast too early and you're not really sure what they're going to do but they get slow again only to get fast in the next line.  Then they just end it.  \n\nUS BLUES kicks butt not.  \n\nVery nice show overall, well worth the listen.  I'm thinking 6/11 and 6/12 were better shows though.",

Understated, jazzy, intellectual. Pleasurably subtle vocals by Donna, and a beautifully serene piano by Keith. Any rust of the hiatus is gone and they are expanding the Sound in unison. Once they get to the middle of '77, it's more like: \"We're here, listen to this!\" The famous '77 run is steroidal in contrast with this run in '76. This show keeps you in that warm, fuzzy, sleepy state of mind.  May '77 screams \"Wake-up!\" June '76 whispers, \"sleep tight........\"",

      "review_text": "Back on the elephant <br />The first tour back from the '75 hiatus is full of great shows, half of which are relatively unrecognized. If you've heard the great 6/9 and/or 6/29, this is on par. It's hard to believe they played a pair of shows at the tiny (especially for the nation's largest metro area) Beacon Theater (upper west side, 2800 seats) - the only time they played here. This first show is the more extraordinary, overall, but they play as a pair. You'd sometimes see this show on all-time-best lists during B&P trading; but that's been awhile and, even though it was touted in DeadBase, seems it's now something of a hidden gem (it used to circ in low-gen, off-pitch AUDs). It has two very entertaining sequences.\n\nFirst Set. Unusually solid from the start, flagging a bit to average by the end. <i>Mama Tried</i> has shades of a '71. You'll note some different textures than the usual in <i>Row Jimmy</i> and a slightly funkier, jazzier <i>Cassidy</i> (though not the tighest of the tour). If you like a Keith-heavy, perfect version, you'll love this <i>Brown-Eyed</i>; and check Bobby. <i>Big River</i> is a bubbler in '76. Jer is incredible and so is Keith. Their fills behind Bobby's verses sent me left at the lights. <i>Might as Well</i> is just the 5th airing and now ready to amaze. This is a helluva sequence. The last two of the set get sluggish and out of tune, but the open-ended jam in <i>Playin'</i> is worth hearing.\n\nSecond Set. The third-ever <i>Wheel</i> is a set opener, as in Boston. It gets better at the end of the tour, but this is still nice - especially the ending. I dig the era of stand-alone Wheels. <i>Samson</i> is also the winning, early arrangement. Donna is great on <i>High Time</i>, though it's not the best example from the tour. <i>Music Never Stopped</i> was also new and, as of now, delicious. Likewise <i>Crazy Fingers</i>, the 3rd one (not counting the Jerry & Friends '75 or the private show). It's OOT but unique enough, and goes into a Spanish-Jam-ish before a drum segue into <i>Dancin'</i>. This is the 2nd of the 6 return <i>Cosmic Charlie</i>s, and the neatliest. <i>Help on the Way</i> is the 4th one toured and played fast. At this point, <i>Slipknot!</i> is actually more of a free jam more than a true Slipknot - and a helluva jam at that. Jeez, when we got a set full of new songs in '92, it sure as hell wasn't the likes of Might as Well and Crazy Fingers. The rest is average '76; <i>Around & Around</i> doesn't really go anywhere, then gets stumbly, though they were then a tight enough unit to handle such.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: A\nOverall = 4\u00bd stars HG\n\nHighlights:\nBrown Eyed Women - listen to Keith and Bobby\nBig River - incredible\nMight as Well - first ace version\nMusic Never Stopped - new and delicious\nCrazy Fingers  - unique, with a Spanish-like jam and Drums segue\nCosmic Charlie - neatliest of the returns\nHelp on the Way - brisk and astonishing\nSlipknot! - played as a free jam \n\nSOURCES: The SBD sources are identical until partway into the second set. The gems_82308 works, but only the hollister_22804 is complete, and is the best source from High Time onward. Sir Mick did a few corrections for set-2_sbd_sirmick_78433, but High Time and Franklin's are cut off, plus the last seconds of MNS, and a few seconds are missing from Crazy Fingers @9:26. The Dusborne matrix is lively. The vernon_10917 AUD is pitched too slow.",
