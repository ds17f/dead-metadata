      "review_text": "Dupree's return & new debut's... Hey buddy, good observation ! Your right about \"Country\" not county. I was there, and I agree about Black Peter. The same is true for much of the generic tunes !\n     But, the new debut's of West L.A. Fadeaway, and Day Job were certainly, at least for me, very cool. I know many folks got bored with Day Job by '85, since they drove it into the ground, thus probably causing them to elect not to studio record it.\n     However, I always thought it was a typically great example of how great Garcia was at writing tunes with a blues/jazz/folk \"turnaround\" in it. That takes some explaining for those of you who don't konw what a turnaround is, but perhaps later, (I personally have always called Jerry the \"King of turnarounds\"; not only in his original compositions, but in a very wide range of pieces, and improvisations of almost any variety. ie. he would ingeneiously throw in a turnaround where one wouldn't typically characterize the tune, or section as blues or folk etc).\n     Also the lyrics to West L.A. Fadeaway are different. I have some more comments regarding this but maybe later, since those are mostly experiencial personally.\n      But, most notably, and obviously totally unexpected, was the extremely welcome return of Duppree's Diamond Blues, and even better than the early rendtions of course given the modern equipment, ie. \"envelope filter\" etc. for an encore.",

What a day! Two stages and so much dust from dancing and i was impressed trying to be cool in a sea of vuarnets trying to really figure out the adulation. Then all alone inside the colors and happysunshine and chaos Jerry did reach under the ground and pulled that searing Black Peter from where cold real sacred things live and delivered it whole into my mind where it sits like a hard gem still. And right then, that very then, I fell off the curb climbed aboard and rode, more or less, the only thing going in our culture 'till portland '95 when he waved goodbye.

Peace\nPS Addendum: Ran in to an old friend who was with me at the show & he reminded me that the show was acyually cut a little short due to excessive dust being kicked up by all the dancers, Despited repeated pleas to cease, the dust continued to blow into the face of the Boys and thet had to shut down a little early.\nPeace, Jeff",

      "review_text": "2nd Decadal Field Trip Was indeed held in the fields (parking lots) of the Oregon Country Fairgrounds (www.oregoncountryfair.com). My first show, and quiet the introduction! Arriving the day before to camp at the fairgrounds,  driving in from the Oregon Coast it rained, cooling the area for a following hot and beautiful Oregon summer day! My greatest impression was the hippie parents and their children running with rose garlands and streamers in their hair. And the sense of family (and history) with Kesey and the pranksters about. A perfect location for the opening Bertha, hot and sweltering, dancing, marveling at the wooded hill lines surrounding the site. Loved China Cat! A lot of the show resonated with that west americana (BRiver->Uncle, Chinacat->Rider). That day was a field trip, myself on 1400 mics before a girl dancing beside me gave me one more tab! The Other One and the bus came by.... That night I had the privilege of camping within the rambling figure-eight of the fairgrounds itself and spent most of the night in a huge sauna (75 people) at \"the Ritz\". The following morning I walked around a quiet and near vacant wooded fairground, marveling in desire to experience the fair itself. The following year I did indeed attend the fair, and have since. And in 1992 the Grateful Dead indeed was set to return. I actually was chosen as a craft vendor for the concert. There was nothing in OR that prevented the concert. Jerry's personal Doctor told Jerry to get off the road and take care of himself. The good Doctor pulled the plug for health reasons. I was told this by the Doctor himself years later at a Eugene show. There was a followup make up show out at \"Conde's Redwood\" and I clearly remember the T-Shirts showing a slovenly Jerry in bathrobe eating a hamburger and milkshake for breakfast. Jerry did come clean quiet a bit and gave us many more wonderful years! OR and Wash shows were not as common as elsewhere, I saw most OR shows from the Field Trip '82 to the Portland '95 shows. I give a five just based upon the sheer hippie significance, I would also suggest getting the '72 show too!",

Rolling Thunder (The man, not the band) came out and did some crazy-ass injun dance and the rain went away. Peter Rowan came out and played a few bars.  The boys took the stage for a while.  After the last encore, the clouds gathered quickly and it pissed rain for two days.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT F**k with the Shoshonee.  They will mess you up something fierce.",

Bobby is coming out of his pants singing the \"Bob songs\" of the 2nd set, also some interesting lyric changes made in Truckin that make for an interesting time.\n\nGreat show, check out the first \"Field Trip\" if you have not heard it yet.",

I've only been to 35ish, shows, but having lived in SFO and Oregon, this one was special.\n\nJust listen to Jerry's spot-on guitar leads, and Bobby's intense vocals.  While watching this show, you could just tell from the first song, this was going to be 'great'.  And it was. A warm day, perfectly tuned instruments, Mickey was on fire, Bobby and Jerry were in another fine-tuned dimension. \n\nI remember it like it was yesterday, almost a 'mini-woodstock' but perfect weather, perfect songs, everything was 'in tune' on this day in '82 in Oregon.",

After driving all day to get to Veneta, and listening to the rain drumming on the roof of Dark Star that night, we were sure we would awaken to a quagmire, AND a morass, but the weather was beautiful. We washed down $2(3/$5.....we were thrifty shoppers) hits with water from an Army surplus water trailer, and waited as the temperature climbed, the sun rose in the sky, and our energy kicked into overdrive. The dust and the heat was totally worth it. Peter Rowan came out solo, Wavy Gravy was up from the Hog Farm, and the jug band Strangers With Candy(an offshoot of the Dynamic Logs) changed their name to Sometimes A Great Jugband for the occasion. Robert Cray was great, and the Flying Karamozovs were wonderful(as usual). \nTo Rhubarb, who blamed the cancellation of the 1992 Field Test on the church ladies, did you forget that Jerry went into kidney failure about 10 days before the show? That was the reason the band cancelled touring for about 6 weeks, and to Bilbo Baggins, who said he stole the show, I don't remember you at all, but I sure remember the St Pauli Girl lookalike that kept feeding me grapes all through the show to ward off sunburn, and who went from fully dressed to nothing but sky blue panties as the show went on. Now SHE was a show-stopper, and is she now, that beautiful girl who just felt I needed taking care of? Bless you!",

Sunny day in Kesey's back yard, middle of the woods with the Prankster's and the Flying Karamazov Bros. The music was fantastic, the volume was cranked, and I am not sure I will ever recover. Thank God! :)",

Sundance ) was 21 and life was BEAUTIFUL!! ceremonial button's for breakfast, walking around with my guitar from camp to camp exploring, singing and meeting so many wonderful folks along with seeing long time friends again. The camping was great even though it rained the night before, I will always cherish these memories, This show changed my world forever! It was here on that fateful day of August,28 1982 when I first met The Great Intergalactic Cosmic Gypsy Rainbow Visionary Peace Circus and Trading Council. I had no choice but to join up with them and abscond the giant geodesic dome set up at the concert on loan from Oregon State University, so, with Condor at the wheel we landed at Peoples Park in Eugene where we set up the dome then we headed for cougar hot springs and many many more adventures......but that is another story. Great show!!! fare thee well my friends Aloha",
