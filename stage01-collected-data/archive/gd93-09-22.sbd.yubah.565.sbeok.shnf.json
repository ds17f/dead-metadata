After a year with a couple stinkers for shows, and some real gems, these MSG shows were mint.  I was just going to go to one show but when I heard how \"on\" they were, I went to all.

I've seen Murray shred it with the Dead in Oakland, CA.\n\n2) Apples & Oranges to compare Branford & Murray. Branford certainly knew the songs at least a little.\n\n3) Not hearing Weir was a blessing near the end. He had a very caustic tone and used the whammy bar way too much. He was a better player in the early 70's (70-74).",

Been something of a life's calling ever since 1972, I was a Miles and Trane fiend prior to the Grateful Dead, who I was brought to the first time in Madison Wi, in 83, kicking and screaming, and heading for the most humbling evening of my life, though having reheard that show many times, I suspect the doses helped.\nHowever someone down the line I believe over stated David Murray's importance in the lineage of jazz music, though he may indeed be one of the better quality tenors still standing. I am someone who can bore u senseless with my knowledge of jazz be it mainstream or avant garde, the latter of which is the realm Murray is normally operating out of. And as the decades pass the realm of jazz that I have least tolerance for, though I did not say none. A signifigant slice of Sun Ra's career, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and some, though definitely not all, of the latter day Trane, say 65 thru 7. In large part because the first two of those knew how to keep that shit swingin and not just being discordant for its own sake. In any case giving this show a listen, I am hearing Murray adding little to the already fairly lame proceedings. Branford is a more lyrical, or melodical player to begin with and likely more importantly found a more happening Grateful Dead on his visits. Though even Ornette Coleman definitely added something to his offering on Space during his visit I think in the same year on the other coast. Basically saying Murray ain't all that, I could name 50 tenors through jazz history who are his superior officer, and I could name them within 10 seconds of hearing their sound.",
