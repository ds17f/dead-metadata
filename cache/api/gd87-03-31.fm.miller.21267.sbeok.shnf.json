Jer simply shreds the brief solo, drums pounding, Phil bombing, even Bobby gets into it with a roaring 'keep us on the run... RRUUUNNN!!'.  The whole 1st set sparkles - great Desolation with more Bobby roaring \"was that some kind of JOKE?!!?\".  2nd set a bit snoozier - Jed must've come out scratchin the crook of his elbow after break.  Rating is based mainly on the killer opener.",

      "review_text": "Another very fine night, 3 1/2...to end this Spring '87 run @ the Spectrum Give it up for the radio listeners. :o)\n\n1st Set: I can smell a 'strange' smell from here... Nope, all a tease. Instead a little \"Jack,\" if you please. Not the smoothest build ever, but certainly train-powered. Easy segue to \"Franklin's\" Feels breezily right (where's the intro solo Jerry?!) A too short version tho quite potent. \"CC\" continues the sway, butt bumpin'. I dig these radio promos. It feels all appropriate. \"Ramble\" is enthusiastically sung and his leadership makes it a worthwhile version. \"Tons\" is endearingly nostalgic. \"Mama\"'s brisk, sung with contours by Bobby & Jerry...Gosh, \"River\"'s intro always makes me cut loose. Standard otherwise. \"Candyman\" is quite powerful tonight as Jerry really throws his emotional weight behind singing those reluctant verses. It just amazes me how I've never heard Bobby flub any line from \"Desolation Row.\" This version isn't 10-16-89, (what is?) but it fits the bill nicely. \"Ease\" is just that, a triumphant end to the best 1st set of the 3 night stand. \n\n2nd Set: Hey, we get the radio announcers telling us it's \"Touch\" time. Standard. \"Estimated\" slinks its way in, it's a patient pleasant version but does not reach the heights of a lovely \"Terrapin\" which both cleanses and reinvigorates my soul.  \"Drums\" are lively and active but \"Space\" is too passive to quench my thrist. \"UJB\" emerges gently and is quite decent, especially the bridge leading to the final clap-along, (til they slow up to sing...awkward transition) \"Miracle\" is decent and despite the garbage raucousness of that ditty, they convincingly move to a very pretty solitary \"Stella.\" \"Around\" serves it purpose, which is to arrive at a juke-joint \"Lovelight.\"  Hands holding hands, arms attached to arms...we all sing \"Brokedown\" together.",

Had a great time in the parking lot (took train/subway down) as informal 'concessionaires' were very kind and reasonably priced (where can you get imported bottled beer for $1 - nowhere but a Dead show!!!)  Anyway was totally taken with this guy, was worred about dancing when I got in as I was, like a lot of girls (I was 17) are about their appearance, especially when relaxing and dancing.  Luckily, the show seemed fast-paced, lively, and upbeat.  The music wasn't too loud as with some bands and and things kept moving along and there was just a general happy air (hmmm) about the place, as with Dead shows in general.  Forgive me for being sentimental about the review;  I married the 'guy' and we have 2 beautiful sons (had tape of Dead tunes to play in labor for the 1st, was in too much pain to remember anything but Brokedown Palace) and have a wonderfully happy marriage.

      "review_text": "The 3-3187 of 3-31-87 While not the best show of the Grateful dead, maybe not even in my top 10, this is an important show I believe. This is the kind of show that opens up your ears to the pure magic of the Grateful Dead.  This was my first bootleg.  My first show was 3/28/90, the first \"Weight\", one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  But it was 3-31-87 that truly opened up my ears to the complexity and brilliance of Jerry and the whole band.  It still does.\n\nListening to the Jack Straw/Franklin's tower open about 2,000 times helps too.  But the whole show is as hot as the open.  They are just on fire out the gate and they never let up.  The mix is incredibly good, although there is a low hiss, maybe that was god listening in, sometimes he thinks he is Jerry Garcia.\n\nYou can't just jump into 1968 Dead and hear it fully.  It takes time I believe.  This show is a great bridge.  Everything you are about to hear is what occurs at ten times speed with ten times  more frequency in 1968.  This show is the vehicle with which you can open up your receptors to 68 Dead, Jerry on the Les Paul, Billy and Micky chasing...ok back to 3-31-87\n\nHere is my review:\n\nIntro:\n\nThe MMR guy saying, \"here we go\" on the first few notes of Jack Straw with the respect, seriousness and levity that the masterpiece which is about to unfold commands.    \n\nFirst Set:\n\nA just perfect Jack Straw, it just builds and builds to such a tight but incredibly powerful finish.  \"Wow, that was hot, wait a second, is that....\" - love the crowd reaction, they stay blistering hot into Franklin's, the crowd is a little stunned at how hot they are, maybe the band too, but on Jerry's third solo you just know this night is going to be special.  Jerry is just on Fire, persistently.  The boys is in complete control.  Buckle up.  This is gonna be fun...\n\nSlow it down with the CC, stretch out some blues, we need a little break, into a sweet Ramble on Rose.  Tons of steel, Phil Chimes in towards the end, nice save.  Then it's time to play with an incredibly tight Mama Tried->Big River.  \n\nCan they hit a wrong note?  Have they stalled once yet?  No, they have not.  Perfect game through 7.  This is getting serious...    \n\nThen just a great song choice with Candy Man, oh boy, this was sweet.  The Candy man definitely is in town, at the Spectrum on 3/31/87.  Then a chance for a let down when Bobby has his turn, but the Desolation Row is just unbelievable.  Dylan wrote the song, the Grateful Dead perfected it with this version.  Brent and Jerry's subtle background color is so poignant, it connects the lyrics to the emotion through sound on such an impossibly linear path.  This is what emotion sounds like.  Then after Jerry's second long solo (another gem) there is a few second pause around 6:30 as they kind of miss the downbeat, but everyone just relaxes, and trusts, and there is just 10 seconds of magic, as they create a bridge 1,000 times more beautiful that what they might have intended in the first place.  This is the magic of Grateful Dead, these moments of pure levitation, when the music plays the band, this is what other bands can't even approach, these 10 seconds.  Then Jerry chiming in, \"where lovely mermaids flow\".  Then a text book Don't ease, routine, quick tight finish.  We'll be back in a little bit...\n\nSecond Set:\n\nMaybe a little disappointment with the Touch of Grey, but even in a perfect game you throw a few balls.  The band is just so tight, anything is OK, and for what it's worth, this is the best live version ever in my opinion.  Great Estimated, brilliant tight jam, then the Terrapin D/S UJB, top notch, top notch. Hot Miracle, and then the most beautiful Stella Blue, Jerry's solos, especially the last one, are spiritual experiences for me.  Things I can come back to now and again, to remind me of what is possible in this world. What I used to dream about.  Humans can do incredible hings, make incredible sounds, when you witness miracles like this jam, it brings you just a little closer to your dreams...  Hot round and round and then a crisp playful Lovelight, Jerry's color is just epic,  best since 1970 in my opinion.  He is just dancing around the universe, he covers it all with the primary Lovelight jam, some great interplay from Bobby too.  The whole suite after drums is epic in my opinion, every transition is brilliant...   \n\nFare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell, gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul...",

I have come to the conclusion the the Spring of 87 is one of the best tours of the 80s. While there might not be many long jams or mind-melting psychedelic moments or dazzling song sequences, just listen to how really beautifully played everything is on this night and the others surrounding it. The energy and tightness are high. Jerry sings with spirit and plays great. No cheesy effects --save those for the much praised 89 and 90.   \n\nYou must listen to this tour -- so much of that Dead joy in the playing and audience responses. This is the Dead -- crisp, clear, and on fire (try just about any song here -- but boy Jack Straw, Candyman in set one, the whole of set 2).  There is something right on target about the Dead in this show (try Hartford, Worcester and others on this tour too).",

First of all let me start of by saying if you don't have this show , don't pass go....stop what you are doing and get it RIGHT NOW. \nThis version of jack straw is the most INTENSE version I have ever heard. The boys were just on this night. You can actually feel the energy just from listening to the show. It's almost like before they went on stage all the pieces were in order and they just fit how they were supposed to. Up until hearing this show jack straw was never one of my favorite songs, but that all changed after hearing this....then going into franklins....oh my god the journey is just beginning. If you are a long time deadhead you will love this show....if you are new to the dead you will love this show....it is that intense. \nMy first show was in worcester ma on 4/3/87 which I'm sure you can tell is just a few days after this one. I listen to this show and just think to myself, my god what I would have done to have been there (although I was lucky enough to be at the \"darkstar\" show when they brought it back in 89). \nWhy are you still reading this?? ....you should be getting your own copy of this show by now....:)",

Jack>Franklin's and others have been given deservedly high praise.\n\nSecond set - while Touch is not my favorite, this was just prior to the release of In the Dark, and still only 4 months after the bands return.

Jerry is tentative as he approaches his vocals in Stella. I don't know if it was finding the right emotion - but by the bridge he is pouring his heart out.\nBob picks up the rock n' roll with Around>Lovelight.\n\nAnd in a year saturated with BMR (and that song is a beautiful) we get one of the most heart-felt renditions of Brokedown.\n\nI wonder if they did a Dick's/Dave's Pick-Vault release/Road Trip if they would put this one in the running? \n\nGod Bless and Enjoy!",

This has to be the fastest tempo Straw I have ever hear and the solo leading up to the critical \"Jack Straw from Wichita\" section is a perfectly crafted masterpiece of incrementally building momentum. Perfectly timed feedback pause at 3:45 in the switch to overdrive has the crowd achieving lift-off. This version absolutely crushes.
