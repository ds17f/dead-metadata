      "review_text": "Definitely a zone of it's own ! I was at this show, and mostly I'd concure with the others but the Scarlet Begonias into Fire on the Mountain, has stiff competition, so that is questionable, about if it's best of the tour ? Likewise it was a good U.S. Blues but that is so common, I'd be even more hard pressed to say vs. others. On the other hand, simply by virtue of it's being pointed out below forces the rest of us even if just momentarily to consider it.\n     I'd say it's similiarly tough to pick the better, between this and Stanford's She Belong's to Me ! Moreover, it's been a while since I've listened to my Greek tapes that are in storage, but this Satisfaction  was as Satisfying as one of the performances they did of that at the Greek; was it one, a few years, I think a couple of years before ? (I was at all those as well, but I'd have to look it up). Regardless, of the Greek version; what really grabs me is the opening splitting/spitting crackles of the woofers from Phil's first couple of notes starting Satisfaction. Even though it's not the greatest, I take that baxk a very nice Comes a Time apart from a tiny lyric flub and Garcia cutting himself off abruptly prematurely, in favor of an equally under developed Around & Around. Nevertheless it's impossible for me to frown when any time comes for Jerry to to play Comes a Time, hence quite Satifactory indeed ! But still necessary to get the complete audience recording of Twilight Zone !\n     That was so appropriate because it was so bizarre to me before the show and after; the relatively mellow way the cops were handling, things which to many a seasoned Dead Head wouldn't seem to be a big deal but to the average cop in many towns could seem alarming. Like for example, I remember after the show, how tolerent they were to some fellow, (instead of arresting him, he was just given a towel), who had apparently lost his clothing ie, he wasn't carrying them either; besides them not being on his body. But more so, what started this impression to me was how it cracked me up as they were driving around with all sorts of Rock'n Roll bumper stickers of various types plasters every which way on there cars, while blasting stuff like Creedance Clearwater Revival and other so-called \"Classic Rock\" etc. over their bull horns, in order to clear a particular path through a given swell of congestion !\n     Although. given it being September the Sun was still fairly high as it wained toward twilight this bizarre other-zone feeling lingered on for quite while posted on my brain. Therefore, I post this review of a reasonably good quality board recording !",

Anyway, a bit of an editorial comment.\n\n9/15/85 Set II has been in my rotation for several years and shows the band in good form.  The Scarlet>Fire set opener is solid, with some funky pre Scarlet \"tuning\" that dissolves instantly into the mellow vibe, stretching nicely into the Fire, which is particularly well jammed.  The front end of the set shows how much the set lists were being experimented with in 1985, while samson might have been somewhat predictable, the spot on she belongs to me (not quite 11/1 but still pretty good) is followed by the \"big top\" truckin tuning, into truckin, that drops delicately at comes a time, which ends abruptly into (?) around and around .. didn't see that one coming.  Some mickey high jinks leads into an out of space U.S. Blues (another rarity) and then just a balls out Satisfaction to close the set.  \n\nThe playing can be a bit sloppy at times, and Jerry meanders at times, but this is primo 85 sh*t.",

Suggesting not bright colors but sandy browns,dirty gold and dull Mars red. When I listen to the Scarlet/Fire from this show and Red Rocks..it sounds 150,000,000 million years old. And im sure thats what it looked and seemed like if one was walking about outside the venue among the rocks in a state of Nirvana.

This is so warm and soft in content and form, from Jerry's froggy smooth voice to the ever so subtle fuzzed out tube tones, this is a burnt sienna gem.  \n\nThe twilight zone tuning, I would say, however, has a little of that cocaine paranoia that could be the GD's greatest liability and assest, often simultaneously.    \n\nDL this before it becomes a Dick's Pick.  Then go out and buy it when its released comercially.  \n\nIts the positive archetype of Fall '85.  Now go listen to it -  bounce along Jerry and Brent's sepia bubbles while Phil lays down a down comforter and Bobby twangs your left channel silly.  The creme of 85.",

I was delighted to learn that the Dead were to play Southwestern U. only a short drive from Pacific Beach. The friend I attended this show with still refers to it as \"Dead on the Border\". The vibe was clearly mellow and security in front of the stage was nonexistent. Both Phil and Bill Graham didn't mind making small talk with fans up front. I felt like I was treated to a private concert. Thanks for a great recording!",
