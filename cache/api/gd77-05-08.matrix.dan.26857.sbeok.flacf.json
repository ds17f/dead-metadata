To have all three sources mixed between 5 channels (+ bass) adds a completely new dimension to this long-loved show.  This is basically a mix-down of that version, but since dts 5.1 is 'lossy', you won't find it here.  Dan reportedly put in something like 175 hours synching up all three sources.  The result - either this matrix version or the dts version - is amazing.",

This matrix recording is great, IMHO. Crank up Dancin' and tell me it isn't near perfect sounding. Good stereo separation with Kieth left and Bobby on the right, Jerry in the middle. Donna vocals too low :-p\n\nOverall, however, the recording is not 100% perfect in that it has a couple of very short, marginally noticable spots of inconsistency. The bass is a little over-rich for me and I couldn't hear the keyboards very well.\n\nIt is all minor though, and easy to ignore any of this for the greater reward of hearing this excellent show.\n\nBalls out Jerry solo work in a robust Jack Straw gives way to ever better soloing in The Deal. Great Fire version. Interesting 16 minute version of Not Fade Away. Energetic Saturday Night encore.",

There is vertually no disruption in mood with the patch in the minglewood open in the Matrix, seemless,  \n\nSometimes I don't even mind a patch if it's quick and the audiance source has integrity, it's like flicking a switch and being at center court, only for a moment, then getting back in the sound truck in the parking lot.  \n   A little crowd noise is alright with me, especially if you find 77 recording's sterile at times, but how much is too much?, and there is clearly some echo within the vocals, therfore I will not claim this copy is superior to the SBD in terms of pure Music.  Enjoyable non the less, why not get both : )\n\nIt's this type of work that I would love to see done to the New Haven Show 3 days earlyer on the Fifth, if there was an Audiance Source, shouldn't there be, check your houseboats everybody!",

Keith's drug abuse and other less-easily ascertained factors reduced his contributions from the brilliant psychedelicized jazz, honky tonk and funk of 71-74 to an apersonal, antiseptic and forgettable nothingness.  1977 was better than 1978 but hints of the bland bloatedness to come were highly evident.  This infamous performance is one such example.\n\nCornell 5-8-77 show was always over-rated and I'm resigned to the fact that it always will be over-rated.  With a handful of exceptions (Sugaree?) the arrangements of the Dead's songs are uninspired and the performances swing back and from from the leaden to the trite.  \n\nThe beauty of a song like Brown-eyed Women was that it was short and sweet.  Here it ends up being another excuse for Jerry to plinkity plink a shiny but vapid series of twangy, subpar twaddle.  Hold this version up to a random version picked from the European tour in 1972 and watch it cry like a cub scout's campfire exposed to the blazing sun.",

This recording is mastered in 2-channel (stereo) so no matter how many speakers you have, you're hearing the same thing as the rest of us, only from more speakers. Your computer is just duplicating the left and right channels on the rears and combining them for the center. It's possible that it also EQ's each channel independently to attenuate certain frequencies (i.e. higher, ambient frequencies in the rear), but if anything that would degrade the stereo mix, cutting and boosting in ways that the mastering engineer didn't intend. In order to truly experience 5.1 sound, a recording needs to mixed and mastered in 6 channels, and this one isn't. Sorry.  :)\n\nAs far as the show goes, this high energy masterpiece goes places most shows don't achieve (which is saying a lot). The guitar solos in Jack Straw and Brown Eyed Women are not to be believed. I'm not into the Dancing in the Streets the way others are, but the Stephen/Fade/Stephen is stellar. Numerous other standouts and next to no filler.\n\nJerry playing more fervently than at any time in his life, Bob nailing funky rhythm parts, Phil on a thumping, walking bass, Keith smoking on keys, Bill/Mikey in driving time, even Donna hitting the right notes in an unobtrusive way.

      "review_text": "it doesn't matter anyway hitched a single ride from the mass pike all the way to cornell.  spent the day resting up, since it was feeling pretty likely that they were going to uncork one tonight.  the return of loser, not heard since first night at the palladium, had the place just flipping out, and jack straw #3 found its legs tonight and jerry just blew it out.  the row jimmy was fantastic, but the highlight of the set for me and the thousands of other freaks is the dancin' - yikes!\n\nafter we all take a step back, they launch the second set. off all the scarlet>fires so far on tour, of which there have been many, this one has the most interesting guitar work i've heard in between and is in the top three so far.  the drummers, too, are doing as-yet-unheard work supporting jerry. vocal flubs in fire are nothing new, but they drop one entire verse and its jam section, so it's a shorter version compared to other nights.\n\nthe highlights of the show witout a doubt are the NFA, which is far and away one of the raunchiest, down-in-the-dirt playings of this song ever by garcia and friends, and the morning dew, which also makes a return after a (relatively speaking) long layoff since night 2 of the capitol theater.  this one is simply phenomenal and can stand with any dew ever played, period.  we are just spent, physically, emotionally, cosmically when they finish.\n\na really raucous saturday night, sounding and feeling like the one in the dead movie sends me \nout into a snowstorm (!?!?) to start truckin' up to buffalo for tomorrow night's show.\n\n******\nthis show was probably the second tape i ever got.  it was a crappy version and it was a long time before i got a board-quality replacement. this matrix, however, is the best recording of this show ever, save the few seconds in LL where something fails.  i heard things i'd never heard before, even after countless listenings over the decades. they are truly a band beyond description.",

      "review_text": "Best Dead Show Ever This show can be considered the quintessential Dead show for many reasons, the music being just one of them.  \n\nFirst of all, the Beatty Board recordings of this show are of phenomenal quality and were widely circulated during the pre-cd years.  We are very fortunate, through technology, to have forums such as Archive.org where we can access excellent non-mainstream music with such ease.  Back in 'the day' such efficient medians simply did not exist.  That being said, this show became a gem to so many and inevitable lead to a tonal conditioning of there brain waves.  Add to this that the show was also released as a Dix Pics. Therefore, this show was probably the most successfully circulated show out there.  The spectacular sound quality and precise mixing levels allow folks to come as close to possible to hearing what it actually sounded like to be at a Dead show.\n\nAnother pro to this show is the set list selection which, though typical for 1977, has many of the favorite songs that most Deadheads love the best.\n\nOn top of this, the boys staged a legendary performance.  The band played like a well oiled machine seeming to hit every progression, peak, low, transition, and climax perfectly.  They each seem to channel clean an crisp sound through their instruments with authoritative ease.  This undoubtedly speaks of their commitment to each other, the music, and the fans at this point in there career.  I would further argue this is one of the most professionally perfect musical performances ever.  Many people will argue otherwise stating that Fire was to mellow or that Keith overplayed in this song or underplayed in that song.  However, bands like the Dead use a musical technique called tension and release to rock the energy of the crowd back and forth.  (The same technique used in classical music.) The idea being that, without lower (more mellow points) in the show, there is no base for them to build to a climax.  Phish is a band that learned to master this technique and it is one of the main reasons that loyal fans flocked to their shows in droves.\n\nThe next reason for this shows greatness is that is represents the PEAK of the Grateful Dead as a band.  There is no point to argue the fact that every band, every musician, and more, every artist, reaches a peak in their career where their creative soul, skill, and craft are at their greatest.  Once they reach this summit they can never attain such acumen again.  It happened to Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Leanardo DaVinci, and any other great artist that lived long enough to reach that point.  Phish reached this point in 1997 and acknowledges such as a major reason for their breakup (following the example of Led Zepplin).  In trey\u2019s own words, they didn\u2019t want to become a \u201ccaricature of themselves\u2019 up on the stage going through the motions. Can you name any great classic rock band that as good as they were in the 60s and 70s.  Of course not, they are all just collecting royalties and replaying all their old classics.  One argument is that when an artist stops struggling, they lost their creativity. It is the struggle that gives their art its soul.  That being said, 1977 was the Dead's high point and, although they had great moments after that, the consistency was never the same.\n\nTo listen to Cornell 77 is to listen to a superb quality recording of a legendary rock band at its peak playing each song to near perfection in front of a venue full of adoring fans.  Therefore, for those variety of reasons and in my humble opinion, Cornell 77 is the quintessential Dead show.\n\nThat being said, nowadays I find myself listening to more to the older pre 1973 dead as well as acoustic sets.  \"New Speedway Boogie\"!, \"Dire Wolf\"!, Friend of the Devil\"!\n\nPlease note, these thought are my own personal opinion and I welcome comments and rebuffs.  Maybe, years from now, as I grow older and wiser, these opinions will change.",
