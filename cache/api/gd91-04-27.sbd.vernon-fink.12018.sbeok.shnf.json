The Scarlet>Fire is interesting. Unusual jam between Playing and Uncle John's. Sound is SBD with a few AUD patches, no biggie.",

The second set bolted out of the starting blocks with \"Sugar Magnolia\" > \"Scarlet Begonia's\". \"Sunshine Daydream\" would have to wait until the end of the 2nd set the following day.\n\nLooking back now, it's pretty clear to me that these 1991 shows with Bruce Hornsby on piano were some of the most inspirational in the bands lasts years with Jerry.\n\nI will never forget that weekend in Las Vegas, NV. It's permanently embedded on my mind as one of the best times I've ever had with people and music in my life.\n\nThank you, for a real-good time.",

Between the wide open desert with the hills in the background and all the colors in the crowd and the great tunes, this setting seemed to capture  both  the country/western and the psychedelic  atmospherics that were totally appropriate for the Dead in a way that the arenas and sports stadiums out east never could. Throw in Santana, kind bud, a great setlist full of classics and more than a few hot babes in minimalist summer attire and it was a perfect day (as was the next).  Seeing all the heads on the Strip and in the Casinos  was also quite a trip.  God, I miss the Dead!",

      "review_text": "I've been searching for this show..... ....on and on for years now!  Finally, I found it and I really appreciate it.  For me this show was the greatest concert I've ever been to.  For any band period!!!  The start of the show was a little off, but, man, when the sound system kicked in........WOW\n\nI can still hear the show in my head; I can't seem to put in words exactly how good this show was.  For me it was everything magical.  One of the most perfect days I've ever had in my life.  It was the music - My friends & I were hoping for certain songs before the show and they played every one that we wanted to hear. The atmosphere was awesome.  Fire on the Mountain was awesome.  This is just my personal opinion, but I think they picked that number because the mountain range in back of the stage was fire red....They looked like 'fires on the mountains' :  Don't get me wrong...I wasn't trippin on anything at all.  Clean and beyond sober that day, my friends!\n\nJUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC PLAY!~\n\nThank you very much Jonathan Aizen for uploading this show and to archive.org for hosting it.",

      "review_text": "My first show I had listened to the GD for years but had never had the opportunity to go to a show before. I will never forget how I felt when they played Black Peter and I found myself in a state of mild euphoria.  I was smiling and I could not stop smiling.  I was amazed at the interaction between the band and the crowd and how they seemed to draw energy from each other.  Everything seemed so perfect, the sun setting over the mountains, the red sky(it was really red not drug induced red)the crowd reaction to the band and last but not least the band was really on that day. As that other reviewer said there really seemed to be a fire on the mountain during \"Fire on the Mountain.\" \n\nIt was at that moment that I decided that I needed to go to as many shows as possible because I wanted to get that feeling again.  Alhough many moments came close, I'm not sure that I ever achieved my goal.  It certainly wasn't for lack of trying. I ended up going to approximately thirty shows over the next four years including four LA shows in 1994 while I was on crutches.",

Lots happened too; a couple got hitched and shared their wedding cake w/ some of the fans (I had a small piece and it was good), a gorgeous sunset and some FINE halucinagics (sp).\nWe all left the show to head back to the casinos and THE LIGHTS; they were NEVER MORE COLORFUL!\nIt was an EXCELLENT weekend all the way around (and around); and really nice to see Las Vegas 'awash in tye dyes'!",

I\u2019ll never forget coming out of the outdoor showers that were set up on the stadium floor to keep us cool and literally running right into Bill Graham.  He was carrying a bunch of papers which I managed to get pretty soaked, but he simply laughed it off and on our merry ways we went.",

It was a stunner to all involved.   Great, solid first set...but the second set is a monster!!  Absolute classic first half of that second set...a juicy, jamming, Dionysian affair!The whole stadium spinners during that Playin were just insane.... the Black Peter was BIG GUNS!! The whole weekend felt like a carnival--F.U.N.!!",

      "review_text": "Top 5 1991 Show For Sure Flew in from Chicago with my main touring buddy and believe it or not stayed with my grandparents who lived in Henderson.  What a weekend to say the least.......\"Don't you let that Deal go down\".\n\nWeather was perfect(Sunny & 70) as we made our way down to about the 10th row.  Santana ROCKED for his 75 min set and he only played 2 songs I recognized.  It was all new shit and it was unbelievable.  Dead open with Touch and set I is a blur.  Highlights are FOTD and a killer Cassidy>Might as Well set closer.  Good to see the boys have ressurrected some of their older stuff(BT Wind,Rueben,Speedway,Might as Well) Jerry seems interested and this is Vegas so anything is possible.\nSet II was absolutely mind blowing.  Of the 100 or so shows I've seen, this one ranks near the top.  Jerry had COMPLETE control of all midi effects and he didn't forget ONE lyric.  Sugar Mag>Scarlet>Fire>Playing>Uncle is a dream pre-Drums jam.......almost an hour of magic before Drums.  Space is good and after a mediocre Miracle we get the Black Peter for the ages.  Deadbase ranks this #1 (along with Winterland 10/19/74)  Jerry is singing his heart out and the solo is ridiculous.  Huntington '78 is my fav Black Peter, but this is my #2.  The rest of the show is standard as was the next day.",

      "review_text": "Great show Both sets were hot!\n\nThe best available copy of this show on archives.org at this time is the three source copy edited by, of course, Charlie Miller. However, I don't hear any sound quality flaws in the second set except for the encore--The Weight (For the songs that have sound quality imperfections--Touch, Loose Lucy, The Weight, perhaps others--you will want to listen to the three source copy...)",

      "review_text": "- Why patch in crowd noise (and crowd noise only) from an AUD tape at the beginning? Anyway, like many SBDs, this needs some EQing to offset the jangly, overpowered mix. Touch sounds like a soundcheck in which Garcia's guitar is almost completely buried & there is much clipping. Walkin' is decent, but the war of the keyboardists, as always, is slightly annoying. Mexicali is a floppy, noisy mess, but Maggie's Farm is quite a sweet little jam. Loose Lucy...agh! Too many keyboards! Too many musicians forgetting where the changes happen! Wellnick can't sing on key & his keyboard tones are cheesy, & Cassidy is a lesson on how a jam should not sound: no space at all between the players. But lo and behold, the normally shoddily-played Might As Well approaches true greatness, even though you can't tell what Garcia's solo is like over the now predictably co-intrusive keyboards.\n\nSugar Mag is another pile of noise, and it looks like the second set will be as grueling as the first, but then Scarlet appears, noticeably trimmer and more beautiful, and the Fire--even with the crowded bandwidths--is a masterpiece. An excellent Playin/UJB follows, and the jam into Drums hints at Corrina. Miracle is awesome apart from a terrible full-band miss at the end of the last chorus.",

      "review_text": "Vegas '91 Coming up on 24th anniversary of a most killer weekend of music in the dessert. My buddy Tony, who passed away 2 yrs ago, and I flew out from the east coast to sin city to catch the Dead with Carlos Santana. It was hot and the women were barely dressed. The music was hotter and the dead heads on the strip after hours were fascinating to all the people of the town who thought they had seen everything the strip had to offer, that was until the deadheads took over the town. What a time to be in Vegas. I always think of those times this time of year. I went back the next 4 years but the first show in 1991 were by far the best.",
