Definitely a cool reminder that yes even though the Dead played the \"greatest show on earth\" their performance was certainly not as peak as preceeding shows i.e. Harpur, its still fun to visualize the Dead playing in front of 400,000.  A number that would be transcended four years later at nearby Watkins Glen.  **** for historical value",

Everyone plays well. The \"Dark Star\" is upbeat, tasteful, and has a nice loping groove to it. \n2) I was at Woodstock and, because I was not yet into the Dead, I opted to catch some sleep during their set. The on-and-off rain disrupted all the shows' schedules, so bands were playing round the clock and you had to pick and choose what band's set you would sleep through. This recording fills in some blanks for me. The chatter at the microphone about the bad acid is priceless, as is some of the band members' jabbering.

Naturally, the 38-minute Lovelight is the centerpiece, but I could do without Babbs' nonesensical rant at the beginning.  Jerry's guitar rings like a bell during this number especially. Dark Star is definitely worth the download too, although certainly not the best or most exploratory for '69. And I'm not buying the St. Stephen > Mama tried segue. St. Stephen sounds spliced up to me, and I don't think this is a real segue. Also, do yourself a favor and don't bother downloading the 10 minutes of ranting and tuning between the High Time tease and Dark Star.  Without this it fits on 1 CD. This is a 3.5-star show for '69 rounded up to 4. Of course there is much better '69 material out there, but this is a great historical document.",

Tape slicing (perhapes from power failer) and the vocal drop around 6:30 - 7:30 in Turn on Your Love Light are the only thing holding back these gems.\n\nOverall the sound quality is really good. It is as if the PA system miked the crawed as well as the band and someone made a board mix of that system.\n\nIn the end this is a grate show for true Hippys and Dead Heads alike.

I've gone to some cover band type concerts out in fields which tried to re-enact some of the scene, many years ago, but, even though I wasn't at Woodstock (1 or 2 or whatever number they're up to), I could tell that it just wasn't the same.\n\nBeing born in the early 70's, I would talk to my parents about seeing Janice, Jimmy, Zeppelin, and Canned Heat (though they missed Woodstock, too) and always wished I could have been a part of that era.\n\nI was able to catch they boys at a few shows throughout the 90's but even that scene didn't seem to have the same feeling of the late 60's.\n\nAnd now, I don't even know of any bands that are even close to that scene in the 90's (which was a departure from the real vibe).\n\nSo, all I have to go on, for my meager Dead experience is approximately 25 concerts in big city East Cost venues MSG, Boston, Philly, Albany, Nassau, RFK, East Rutherford, etc.\n\nI wish I could have been in the Bay Area in the 60's or at Yasgur's Farm.  The vibe is so different.  I have no quarrels w/ this show.  I think the Babbling Ken Babbs doesn't take away from the show but rather, makes it!\n\nToo much of today's music is over-rehearsed, well-scripted, sampled, and un-reproducible in a live environment.

Yeah, the open weak with an abridged \"St. Stephen\", and an o.k. \"Mama Tried\".\n\n\"Dark Star\"/\"High Time\" is an exciting jam and as a previous reviewer said deserved to be on the Woodstock collection. It certainly makes a nice antithesis to what is to come. That signature opening lick comes in and takes you through all the possible dimensions and then comes back to earth to proclaim that they've enjoyed their time in space and then sets up for big finale!\n\nAhh, \"Lovelight\". What else can I say? This IS the definitive performance!!!! No \"Lovelight\" before and after has been as electrifying and mind-blowing as this. It drags on and on, and the tension just builds and builds and builds for what seems like forever (and to some music listeners, a half-hour is forever), but once it ends and that familiar Woodstock announcer says \"Ladies and Gentleman, The Grateful Dead\", it was definitely worth it! And that \"Woooooooooaahhhhhh!!!!!!\" of Ken Babbs sneaks up on me every time I listen to it. The whacked out poetry of seeing sunrises, the great the great the great the great the great, the third coast (which I believe is called the Gulf Coast, but that's just my opinion), and not talkin' 'bout Chicago Blues, it certainly adds to the feeling that we just went through space, had a high time, and am now back on earth ready to kick back and turn on that ever-present love light.\n\nDo yourself a favor and listen to this. You won't be disappointed!\n\nFor a band that considered this to be one of their worst performances, they still had plenty of energy and did their absolute best to hide the technical problems that plagued this performance.",

They tried a few times, Watkins Glen, Atlanta, Altamont...but they were nothing like Woodstock.\n\nThis ain't the worst show the DEAD ever did. \n\nI think the fact that Pigpen did a 45 minute version of \"Turn On Your Lovelight\" is proof he was the only one on stage NOT on LSD that day....lol.\n\nThey were there as part of the scene, they were not interested in the exploitation of the Hippies, or the exploitation of the music...they enjoyed themselves, and didn't care about being \"shocked\" by the ungrounded mics, and all the other cool \"crap\" that went on at Woodstock.\n\nMy favorite performers from Woodstock are Joe Cocker & the Grease Band, The Jefferson Airplane, Santana, The Who, Sly & the Family Stone, Janis Joplin, Canned Heat, Ten years After, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIf you're a fan of the GRATEFUL DEAD you're gonna want this show...too.\n\nI was 14 when Woodstock took place, I was too young to go...but I remember all the freaks, weirdo's and hippies carrying on like they were the center of the universe...yeah, of their own world. \n\nMy older brother went, he was 18-19, he came back with Mono...missed the start of college that September, wasn't healthy enough to go to school until January.

Oh, well glad that didn't happen every night.\nOn tape it sure was a trip hearing that dude in one tiny part of my brain while trying to listen and focus on the band playing with the rest of my grey matter.\nI went to one of the Woodstock reunion's on the original site which was in the middle of nowhere before (I heard) someone built a Concert Hall on it. And the thing that stuck with me the most was all the 'private property' signs every where you went.\nAnd really the revolution of the 1960's failed because Socialism and / or Communism just doesn't work in real life.\nMy Grandfather tried to tell me that back when I had my head in the clouds but I had to experience it for myself.\nI love the dead's music and the boys had nothing to be ashamed of musically at Woodstock.\nJust imagine if the Dead had been in prime time @ Woodstock and the 'Touch of Grey' era had started in 1969.(Scarier than the domino theory)\nMost of the soundboard stuff you can get on this site is equal to what the band heard on stage.\nAnd I can tell you from being a head in the era of Cassettes that many times the audience recorded shows were horrible sound wise because of limited technology.

I've long heard the bad reviews by band and fans alike, and after listening, they seem pretty accurate. \nFor one thing it sounds really chaotic onstage. People that aren't in the band going on about bad acid etc for ten minutes between sloppy song versions. Rude sounding crowd alternately shouting \"Sit Down!\" \"Stand up!\" Very scattered vibes. The Dark Star is decent, but there are MUCH better versions from '69. The Lovelight is the best part of the show, but is only an average version for the era. Plus it suffers the indignity of some incredibly clueless and obnoxious person stepping all over Pigpens vocal to deliver some nonsense spoken word bullshit that pretty much ruins any hope this show had. It's most definitely NOT legendary Merry Prankster Ken Babbs. I watched the video and read a description of the event by Ken himself.  The guy must've been out of his mind on the bad acid and clearly had no place being anywhere near a microphone. Babbs actually does the service of coaxing the guy offstage with a joint, but the damage has already been done. Pig and Bobby do their best to salvage the song., but it never really catches on, and ends with a piece of sound equipment literally blowing up onstage. It's right next to Mickeys drums and he straight bails lol. A fitting end to this disjointed performance. \nI'm only giving it two stars cuz of the much better competition from this stellar year in GD history. ",
