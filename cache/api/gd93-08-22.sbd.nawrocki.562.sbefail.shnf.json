As already mentioned, the show is kick-started by Jerry and Phil playing their butts off in Jack Straw to cover for Weir's technical/guitar problems. As of this point there is no looking back, and they just go from stength to amazing strength (from sea to shining sea?). Even the harmonies in Broken Arrow are flawless! Sound quality is superb also. Really clean and nicely mixed - sounds as good as an official release. I wouldn't be surprised if it makes it (and I hope it does) to a Dick's Picks someday!",

We had seen Jerry Band at Shoreline the weekend before, and we were primed for more.  The first day was pretty good, huey lewis, the killer SOTM, pretty good.  the best post-show $1 grilled cheese i've ever had-  partially because I had to wait 20 minutes while the on-tour vacationing executive chef \"prepared\" it.  I kept saying \"hey, that's perfect\"  and he would respond, \"NOT YET!\"  \n\nAnyway,  we were at the back of the Duck stadium, looking directly into the sun.  couldn't see the band to save our lives.  No matter.  Jack Straw for days, beautiful broken arrow, and then a 2nd set from heaven.  It was truly the last pinnacle Dead experience for me.\n\nTragically, on the way home, one of our vans had an accident.  We watched as the the driver of the 1st van fell asleep, and 4 dear friends lost their lives.  The yin and yang of the whole day is almost  too much to bear, and it haunts me to this day.  2 of the 6 survived.  GDP sent a bolt shaped bouquet to each family.  It was almost too much to deal with.  Long time ago, but fresh as yesterday in my mind.\n\nGod bless you all.",

I dont think that ANY show in which Garcia used that awful, ridiculous, pathetic sounding guitar he used in parts of '93 and'94 can possibly merit anything more than 4 stars.  That instrument sounded just terrible and, I think, ruined most of the good performances the band had during that period.  My guess is that he was going for a more acoustic sounding electric guitar.  But the tone is absolutley flat and there is no sustain, and none of the cool effects Garcia used that we all love sounded good.  Compared to the beautiful, round, full tone of his other guitars, this one sounds like a choking animal.  Athough, I love this Jack Straw",

Poor Parish was trying to help him, but Weir just kept slammin' his guitar into the side of a garbage can.  Meanwhile, Phil and Jerry moved center; the drummers were smiling and Vince looked lost but kept playing chords.  It's almost as though they were waiting for Weir to come back and they didn't know what to do (or else they were afforded the little-known luxury of playing the jam in Jack Straw for 8 minutes minus the rhythm section)\n      After Bob comes back and sings the chorus, there's a minute or so before Bertha when you can see everyone talking into their mikes but you can't hear them 'cause of their setup onstage.  Oh to be a fly on the wall for that conversation.  Otherwise, there's a heartfelt Broken Arrow (although Phil strains on it); some nice Jerry leads on Althea, and a pretty sweet H>S>F to close the set.  Second set, the Corrina is worth listening to because the entire band is really trying to figure out how to play this song.

It has nothing to do with lighter string gauges and everything to do with a totally different guitar with a piezo pickup that gave it that \"acoustic\" tone. \n\nNot saying I agree or disagree with patkelley in terms of his feelings about the sound of the instrument, just saying he's right that this was not The Tiger or Rosebud or the Wolf being played. \n\nNote to Maxwell3 for the record, the H>S>F that everyone is lauding was actually the set II opener, not the set I closer. \n\nI love the story about Mr. Weir losing his cool during Jack Straw.

Yes, in 1993 we felt the spirit of community and were so moved to pick up trash in the lot after the weekend.  I miss those simple sweet days.",

As a late bloomer to the Dead (first show was Vegas 1991 - but saw 69 shows from 1991-1995), I know all too well the progression of Jerry's playing over those years.  The 1991-1992 part of my career contained most of the truly mind-blowing experiences, but there were many in 1993 (1994 even) that I put on the very top of my overall list.  \n\nThis show in particular was WAY up there on my list.  No question about it that Jerry \"brung it\" to Eugene.  I was Phil side about 50 feet from the stage, and I was riveted from the first note.  Jerry was in total control both musically and vocally, even lyrically!  \n\nSomeone mentioned his new guitar, and I think that his enthusiasm for his new toy came through that day.  I have to admit however that I really didn't like the sound of the \"Lightning Bolt\" as many have said, it just didn't have the pure emotional tone that Rosebud had (I really missed his 1991 sound).  Oh well, if it made him happy then I'm happy... I am just glad to have had him be here long enough for me to have 4 life-defining years of adventure and bliss.\n\nWith the exception of Jack Straw > Bertha, I think it all started to really kick in about Music Never Stopped., so tight!  Unbelievable rendition!  What an indicator of great things to come... The second set opener was one of the best H>S>F in the later Dead years... He doesn't miss a note and weaves Franklin's in such a sweet way, those first chords after Slipknot... man, the waves of energy pulsating back and forth from the stage across our heads bouncing off the back of the stadium was literally tangible!  One of those peak moments where everyone just comes together (crowd included) and takes it over the top.\n\nOne clear recollection I have is right after Days Between, a girl turned to me and said \"What was that?\"  My mind and heart had just been blown completely open and my face melted, and I just coudn't formulate any human words... Finally I was able to tell her the name of the song, and I felt the words tumble out like stones in my mouth.  It was a very strange experience, to have been taken so far from myself that I couldn't immediately re-exist in normal time and space.  What a testament to the power that was flowing that day!  An enthusiastic 5 stars!",

Jerry was on the cover of Rolling Stone at that time, and he talked about The Days Between in the interview, which I read on the plane.  It was absolutely sunny in Eugene by the time the show started on Saturday, and it stayed that way until near the end of the Sunday show.  The crowd at Autzen was spectacular.  The spinner girls next to the stage were entrancing;  I swear that I could see Jerry's notes coming out of their fingertips.  Near the end of the Sunday show when they played Days, the sun finally got behind a few puffy clouds near the horizon behind the stage and just above those low lying hills outside of Eugene.  I will never forget the image of Jerry singing that song at that moment.  Spine-tingling stuff.  It was the best time I ever had at a show next to Soldier Field 91, which was the best time that I ever had with my clothes on.",

I however was not a late bloomer to dosin and this was definitely the highest show I had ever been at.  I was 22 and had a lust for tryin anything psychedelic.  I licked a puddle of acid that some kind broken leg gentleman gave me (thank you).  I actually had to leave the during Jack Straw cause I was so high.  I trampled my way towards the creek, took my clothes off and lay on top of a thorn bush. I lay there until the last song of the first set, shook myself out of it and walked over to some people for help.  I was cut up, naked and laughing/crying at the same time.  They got some volunteers from inside the show to assist me back in-and I mean back in.  I snuck away once inside and went to the top of bleachers and proceeded to ball me eyes out for joy.  I made it back from the scariest and strangest trip I ever had and was listening to the best music on the planet with the setting sun.   I was never quite the same after that-Thank God and the Grateful Dead.",

So if you're going to go Siskel and Ebert on these shows, then do what the fat guy does, give some thumbs up based on what else was playing in the theater that week. \n\nImagine if roger started every review saying, \"This movie's OK but it's nothing like the kind of movies they were making in the 1970s, those were my favorite.\" when that happens it's time for the home. \n\nSo, I'm giving this show four stars because it's better than four of five of the top 5 billboard albums for 1993. (#1 \"the bodyguard soundtrack\", #2 Kenny G \"Breathless\" #4 Janet Jackson \"Janet\" and #5 Billy Ray Cyrus \"Some Gave All\").\n\nslowhand was #3 with unplugged, sorry deadheads.\n\nAnd I like robbie robertson's take on \"broken arrow\" better.\n\n\nand the music never stops",

There are reasons why not a single official GD release is from a year later than '92....\n\nY'all grabbed my attention with the meta-analysis of 61 reviews topping at 4.4 stars.  However....5 stars = a perfect show and this one is not that. Blown lyrics in Music Never Stopped and-of all things-Bertha, amongst others. Why are there so few few perfect Help > Slip > Franklin's triads throughout the entire archive?  Jerry so often flubs a line or several in what is lyrically one of the most meaningful passages of music I have ever heard.  That said, this one is worthy of rebroadcast to large audiences in that regard as Jerry just barely finds his Way On The Help while totally nailing Franklin's and the musicianship just cooks.  For that matter, the whole show based on instrumentalism is close to 5 stars but the flubbages of songs that should be old hat constitute a 3.\n\nOther Highlights....Althea is syrupy sweet.  Days Between is powerful, brooding, like China Doll but more introspective and seemingly autobiographical...and sad.  I actually rather like Liberty though many of the songs the Dead introduced in the 90s fell very flat.  Samson and Wheel > Miracle are rollicking bundles of joy.  You'll find some of that here.  \n\nI will recommend this show for listening because:\n\nMusicianship: 4.5\nVocals: 3\nSound Quality: 5\n\nThe only better '93 show I know of is 3/27 Albany where somehow everybody gets every word absolutely perfect and the LMA product is indeed a perfect 5 star.",
