      "review_text": "fate music at its best They were billed as Mickey and the Hartbeats. Not only one of the first shows without pigpen, and bobby, but exists historically as a catalyst for developement of the more jazz-based sound that we experience in the early 1970's. I make this statement largely because of the steps that they began to take with improvisation, namely this show's dark star. They not only played one of the greatest dark star's in Grateful Dead History, but delved into deeper psychedelic melodic arrangements that essentially stemmed out of the definitive piece Dark Star. This, of course included the other one, the eleven, and even a rarity \"the seven.\" As this Mickey and the Hartbeats show unfolds, we can begin to see the true genius of Jerry Garcia, and Phil Lesh as musicians, and what they could do without Pigpen and Bobby, who add a more poppy sounding edge to the band, which certainly gave them more appeal to the general public. This show, though outshadowed by 10/8, and 10/31 Hartbeats shows, shows us a different side of the grateful dead, a side more influenced by jazz, and lesh's many improvisational inspirations. We can also see Jerry's raw skill in the blues with The Rub, Death dont have no mercy, as well as Next time you see me, Its a sin, and of course Lovelight.",

Of the 8 shows I've heard so far between 10/8 and 10/30; 10/10 and 10/30 are the best out there so far. Five stars for both shows. If you listen to the last half of the 10/8 shows you can tell the difference between Jack Cassidy and Phil Lesh for anyone concerned. Phil's got the offbeat bass which is his signature, where Cassidy is just a little more solid. Worth getting both these shows whether it be CD or analog. Make's you wonder what migt have been without Bobbie or Pig. Would have lost alot of good music but then again maybe we could still download this stuff.",

While the jams are good, they're also strangely unsatisfying. Nothing remotely approaches the level of transendence that the Dead could and did achieve on a regular basis in 1968. Why? Because there's a great Bobby shaped hole right in the middle of the music and another Pigpen shaped one on the side. I guess you never know what you got till it's gone, eh? I've played this show 3 times and I just can't get into it.",

This pales in comparison to much of 1968, particular January, February, March, and August.\n\nThis is not a Dead show -- the Dead were on a break. They had just finished an awesome tour and were now in town recording Aoxomoxoa and regrouping. There were Dead shows the following week, but in town.\nAt the end of track 1 (miller) Garcia says apologetically \u201cWe just playing here. We\u2019re just goofing\u2026 Nobody\u2019s up to anything serious.\u201d And it\u2019s true. They\u2019re just jamming for fun, and a lot of the jams aren\u2019t all that interesting or inspired.\n\nThis changes Death Don\u2019t Have No Mercy. Jerry starts to get serious, and delivers a good perfornamce. The next track, track 11 (Miller) is a Dark-Star-ish jam, and is much better than the blues jams of earlier in the evening. So is the Eleven Jam, track 12, which is quite good. Jerry and Phil get into a groove that they just weren\u2019t in earlier. It\u2019s interesting to hear the transformation.\n\nBut, with track 13 (the Seven) deteriorates into repetitive chords \u2013 they\u2019re back to rehearsing again, trying to get into a 7/4 beat. It gets better after three minutes or so. \n\nIt\u2019s a Sin is an oldie \u2013 they hadn\u2019t played it since May 1966, according to Deadbase. (There are some great 1966 shows, BTW.) \n\nFYI, there\u2019s another version with some more tracks:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-10-10.sbd.hollister-konstantin-hoelter.5186.shnf",

This period is also, I think, one of the more shameful in the Dead's history, when Pigpen and Weir were on forced leave due to, as afar as I can understand, snooty pretensions to musical sophistication on the part of the rest of the band. I'm sorry, there's just no way you can call Weir any less skilled a player than Garcia, and Pigpen was simply irreplaceable.",

This is Jerry's free-jazz band at his most Impulse recording yet.  i hear Pharoah Snaders and Coltrane and Ornette, etc.  I hear Sonny Sharock too!  I always thought if the band was Bill, Jerry and Phil I'd be happy.  But whatevs.  We all like what we like and that's cool.  Top ten show for me!!!!",
