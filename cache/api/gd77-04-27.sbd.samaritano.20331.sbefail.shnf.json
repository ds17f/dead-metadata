But the show is much better than 4/23 and others.\n\nThis show comes out of the starting gate strong, rockin', and tight, both in playing and vocals. The jams are interesting. Jerry smokes in Sugaree. The set list isn't bad. And it ends with a nice Dew that is on par with the '74 Dews.",

Jerry's just tearing it up, bouncing all over the stage, smiling his ass off. Very cool.\n\nNot too sure about that Sugaree though, contrary to some other reviewers. Jerry's playing was nice, but the drummers seemed to really lose it a few times there. I actually thought the whole thing was just going to collapse under it's own weight at one point -- right before Jerry starts with the double-time leads that usually blast it into the stratosphere. Actually, I was thinking there might not be enough steam going for him to really pull it off, but he managed somehow, and it did start to lift off some after that. Definitely not the best performance of that song to my ears, though.\n\nA solid effort though, and well worth the listen.",

I haven't been moved by Sugaree or Half-Step two doozies that can make me excited.\n\nI'm giving this a 3/5 even though there are one or two songs that are great.  But does that make a show good?  I don't think so.",

Shit, even a blind man knows when the sun is shinin'....I come back to this show often.  As for what that audience and the  REST of us seem to be hearing from this night....this is nothing but damn fine Spring 77' Dead.  Second set is fabulous!!!  The Estimated opener and Scarlet>Fire are played w/ very well and with intention. The Estimated is particularly sick---Keith gets OUT THERE!!  The cheer from the audience when Scarlet gets uncorked is so damn heart-warming!! The transition into Fire is SOOO great. The funky placement of the other cuts in the second set makes for an interesting, one of-a-kind performance during arguably one of the greatest couple of weeks the Band ever played.I noticed around Loser, in the first set,  that Jerry's voice is really in GREAT shape tonight. He sound so good on this day, powerful yet lilting and so sweet.  I was just listening to that summer 1985 growl before this show---what a contrast!!",

As a whole, it's one of my very favorites from the incredible year of 1977.\n\nHeed the reviews; if you don't have this show, you're missing out on a SUPER evening with the band.....\n\nOf particular note is the FABULOUS \"Mississippi Half-Step\"; it's a true contender for the \"Best-Ever\" trophy....!!  ESSENTIAL Grateful Dead!!!",

I always felt like I'd have saved this tape from a burning house before that one, though. That may just have been me being contrary, but listening to this again after many, many years reminded me why. Thanks!",

Either give us a good Aud or Matrix, but not this turn-up-the-crowd-noise between songs crap.\n\nAlso, and this is nitting one little pick, the announcer should know better...he was introducing Grateful Dead, not The Grateful Dead. No such band with the latter name ever existed.\n\n3 stars for the annoying crowd noise. I cannot give the show itself a fair rating because of it...the fades of crowd noise into and out of the songs eliminate any hope of hearing the nuances at those parts of the recording. \n\nSome of us actually like to hear what they are ding between songs.",

The sound is OK, a bit compressed and muffled, about what you'd expect of a tape off the radio from 1977.",

Lots of greatness here - Half Step, Sugaree, MSN, Scar>Fire, Estimated, Samson and Dew all really stand out to me. In particular, the Sugaree has one of the most blissful jams I've ever heard, the Scarlet>Fire is short but has a cool little transition, and the Dew is one of the best of year, with the intensity of a 1973-4 version.",

This was done by their spontaneity and ability to possibly make every show you were at the  best you had ever heard. The 4/27 show ,although  world class for most bands, was a \u201csafe\u201d show for them. Perhaps they were influenced by the presence of the broadcast but by now they were unfazed by this. Anyway they were never an \u201c off the album\u201d live act.",
