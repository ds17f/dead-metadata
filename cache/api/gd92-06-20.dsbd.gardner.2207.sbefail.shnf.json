      "review_text": "\"Same As It Ever Was\" I finally got to my seat just as Promised Land roared to a finish. Bummer - everyone around was raving about the set. Bruce on accordian, too! The second set started with a song I generally wasn't a huge fan of, but it was my birthday, the weather was perfect, and so was the second set. \n\nCorrina was a great spacey intro, for sure. the trance-like repetitive keyboards were a certain harbinger for the rest of the show. The Crazy Fingers jam leading to Playin' shouldn't be missed as it is as pleasant as can be. Bobby's got a great growl during Playin' and the jam is just plain ON - super chill and effortless on everyone's part. The transition into Uncle John's and the beginning of the song are both handled delicately. The UJB jam starts off slowly and builds to an interesting bit of spacey avant-garde jazz that drives the band headlong into Drums/Space. As usual, Billy, Mickey, and the sound guys have fun with this bit, which includes the massive TRAIN WHISTLE that had been occasionally teased since earlier in the year. They really lay on the horn, too. About 3 minutes before the end of Space, Jerry starts to play Shenandoah Lullaby, a song I'm sure many of us heard growing up, especially if there were folkies in your family. This part really must be heard as Jerry switches from guitar to trumpet while Bruce uses his accordian for tone during this quiet, quiet part of Space which slowly leads us into the FIRST CASEY JONES IN 8 YEARS, complete with another blow from the train whistle! [insert crowd craziness here] No time for a post-Space ballad, though, as Bobby drives straight into Throwing Stones, letting us know we are definitely ON OUR OWN! If I remember correctly, the energetic jam cause a more-than-happy freakout in the stands around my seat. Being Saturday night, we got a super-charged rocker of a Saturday Night to close the set.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of the Baba O'Riley > Tomorrow Never Knows encore, but I think that it worked perfectly within the context of this show. Vince definitely gives the vocals all of his energy, and the segue into TMK is flawless. Not a perfect vocal delivery of the song, but it's still excellent, nonetheless. Great background vocal noises during the song and at the end, too (Talking Heads lyrics quietly spoken at end of the song: \"Same as it ever was... same as it ever was\"). Fitting final words, especially if \"same as it ever was\" means EXCELLENT!\n\nIn case I didn't mention it earlier, DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW.",

      "review_text": "And you know that notion ... just crossed my mind In the event others have not been convinced by the prior reviews, let me had my full (black?) throated endorsement of this show.  When you can say the following:  Even the Picasso Moon AND Corinna ROCK, you know you've found a keeper (and indeed they do).  \n\nThe first set is well played, a nice mix of high energy stuff like Maggie's Farm and Promised land and Jerry's tunes, which are mellow at first (FOTD is played at a nice leisurely pace) and he adds a very spacey Row Jimmy that I absolutely love.  The aforementioned Picasso just rips, with great JG leads into what had become a traditional T Jed and then the Promised Land set closer where Vince *does* absolutely take over.  \n\nThe 2d set, in addition to having an interesting set list is spot on start to finish.  This is essentially the *only* listen-able (not a word I know) Corinna I have ever found (and I was there that night too).  It just worked.  I can't give a better explanation than that.  The vocals were right, the harmonies added texture, the \"sampling\" done in the background was perfect, Jerry played some great leads, it just worked.  Corinna moved right into one of my absolute favorite crazy fingers of all time.  VW *got* this song on this night, and his keys shine (maybe he was trying to impress Bruce).  jerry lays a very mellow groove down for the song and his vocals will give you chills.  The playin>UJB coupling is equally strong, again, Vince adding great riffs to Playin and the looooong jam out of UJB into drums is creative, interesting and enjoyable.\n\nNo SBD can re-create the truly goose bump inducing sensation that the air horn > Casey Jones triggered among the faithful.  I was there, the full RFK freak went down and everyone went absolutely apeshi*.  Some buddies and I actually heard them sound checking Casey Jones and thought it had to be a tape or something but there it was (they also sound checked Baba).  Jerry's leads are great, they were *SO psyched, I remember the fat man smiling ear to ear through the whole song, just a great memory of being with the band.  Strong T Stones (Steve Miller slides in mid tune) followed by a great OMSN (again, Miller adding some nice leads) to close the set.\n\nThe encore just blew me away when I saw it live.  Vince's pipes blowing through the RFK PA System were jaw droppingly strong and the T Heads sampling at the end of TNK was something I wasn't even sure at first I was hearing or tripping.  Anyway, this is a 5 star dead show and the #1 show of 1992.  Download it now and start enjoying.",

      "review_text": "Good one Okay, I'll admit that I'm generally turned off to anything after 91.  Even the good stuff (and this is one of them) from 92-95 doesn't really match up to prior years.  The first set was remarkable to me for its similarity to the prior year's first set at RFK (isn't it interesting how they used to fall into certain grooves in certain places, like the Sugar Mags sandwich specials at Hampton in the late 80s?).  Anyway, imho, it couldn't quite match up to the intensity of 91's first set (as memorialized so well in VFTV II).  Similarly, I just could never get into Corrina (sp?--I never learned to spell it correctly, having always written Purina on my ticket stub).  Crazy>PITB is always welcome and these are nice 90's version.\n\nNo, the real reason to listen to this show was, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Shenandoah Space>Casey Jones.  This was the last time the disparate remnants of the tour family I'd seen so many shows with in the 80s would have one last hurrah together.  My buds and I had our heads together mumbling incoherently wondering what they were going to do out of space.  Jerry played the Shenandoah lead quite distinctly in the background, the warm DC summer night sticking to us.  Jerry's instrumental of the melody, which he feels his way through on the fly, is so heartbreaking, and speaks to you the way Dylan's epitaph for Jerry said he could do.  It was an unforgettable few minutes.  \n\nI remember blurting out uncontrollably, \"I don't know, but this is pretty good right now.\"  Then, Mickey comes running out with the train whistle strapped to his torso like some typically-mad contraption.  He sends a couple of bellows into the air, and the entire moment stood still in expectation.  Jerry starts this oddly-familiar riff, hmmm...that's odd...it sounds like...CCCAASSSEEEYYY JJJJOOONNNEESSS!!! OMG! OMG! OMFG!!!!!!  We were literally flattened along with the 90,000 other heads in RFK.  Screams of joy and eyes open wide in bewilderment ruled the day as Casey became this massive sing-along, this joyful re-affirmation celebrating the band and audience (several different audiences, really) that had been through so much together.\n\nWell, the rest of second set was kind of a wash for me.  Although I would see several more shows in the coming years, none of them would come close to matching the intensity of that one last moment, with one exception, and the despair would grow with each coming year.  To a certain extent, that was the last of the boys as I knew them.\n\nNope, when all was said and done, I was reminded of why we had all arrived there on that June night as we were herded like cows onto the Metro, and just as we were boarding at the Stadium-Armory station, a few folks sang \"drivin that train\" to themselves the way a kid does when he's just received that Red Ranger air rifle for Christmas.",

I saw Al Gore on the side-stage, groovin' with one of his daughters too.  Bobby was on Capitol Hill the day before in a congressional meeting (but can't recall why he was there). The 'Casey Jones' and the rest of the set was a major statement to what was happening at the time to others in the world much more unfortunate that us, and the entire video sequence during that set really made a statement too.  My best memory was during/after the Drumz->Space->Jam (before 'Casey Jones') when the band completely left the stage and the beat/music kept on going (and going, and going) just before the band returned and blew all of our minds!

I remember I asked what's he offering and he just said, \"I'll hook you up\" and he paid me face value for the lot... I dunno if he miscounted or meant to do that...\nBut then I parked in Lot 7 down by the water close to the bridge and it was still early but they were hard at it building the city... Almost immediately I was approached by a righteous pedaler of tiny pictures and that vibe was right on... I remember hearing Steve Miller go on and I remember thinking it sounded like shit through the first 3 or 4 songs... \nAnyway, I hooked up with my favorite chef, a short old dreadlocked black guy that I can't remember is name, but he was at all the NE shows I went to and he was funny as hell... I'm not sure if that was as good as I thought or he was just so funny I didn't care... Tacos were gone till I got to the tunnel, I went in sober and a mess and came out clean and waiting to feel the claws come out, 3 beers still left and wtf do I see?? To freaking hippie kids like 15 stories up going like bats out of hell scaling the side of the freaking stadium!! Two other people asked me if they were real... It was kind of surreal given how high up they had to go... I investigated and somehow they got up on top of some portapotties and made it up to the chainlink fence to took off... They damn near had to climb to the top of high side wall, but they both made it, took a bow and disappeared...\nAnyway, I had Mezzanine seats dead center, there weren't many rows or seats per section and there wasn't much air there either and man was it colorful... I had an aisle seat and slide over onto the concrete stairs because there was a breeze coming through the tunnel, the security kid said I don't blame you for that and sat beside me... Which was it was taking everything I had not to freak out,but he was just being lazy... Then about Corinna the cutest little spinner comes up and starts giving me a massage like she knew what was going on down my spine and then she'd float around and disappear, I remember thinking she was like a butterfly... she was in white and when she'd go in front of me, especially at the beginning of Space, it was like she only had one shear layer on and everything was perfect and beautiful, meanwhile the two guys beside me were all about making the obscene gestures to egg me on and missing this incredible freaking show within a show... Then she's gone again and down in the field I'm seeing this freaking green snake like thing growing out of the middle of the crowd... we were all confused as to what was going on... if just kept growing as if it were coming out of a hole in the middle of the people who were all dancing... It must of been 50ft or more longer and it was crawling all over top of the people for what seemed like several minutes, but I'm sure it was only seconds and then it broke in half and there were two and as soon as it became two I could feel all the energy change, then it was 4, and 8 and exponentially getting faster and doubling and the energy was building each time and it sort of dried up like water in really dry dirt and then it was only an afterglow... (someone had a whole bag of glow in the dark necklaces hooked together and fed it out and soon people broke it and then they took the individual parts... but soon it forgot because my spinner was back and this time she was kissing me and hanging on me, naturally her breath wasn't as beautiful as the rest of her but we were totally sharing the the last quarter of Space and were more just enjoying each others faces as lick and kiss and rubbing pads and all the sudden it was like someone threw a flashbang in my face, the fucking whistle went off and between the pair of our reactions she damn near broke my nose and she starts spinning up like a helicopter on two toes and THAT WHOLE FUCKING STADIUM, NO THAT WHOLE FUCKING TOWN EXPLODED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEVER FELT THAT MUCH ENERGY RELEASE ALL AT ONCE IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!!!!! \nThe girl keeps pulling me up to dance with her, and I'd get up for a couple seconds and then sit back down and she did that like 3 or 4 times... But I guess when we were in our own little world, the guys beside me got up and went to the railing to watch and she started pulling on the taller one to dance, meanwhile the shorter one ran back to the safety of his seat and as I was there teasing him making the same obscene gestures to egg him on, I see the holding a ball in her hands, not a real one mind you, but she was miming it well enough that I could see it too... and she had to chase it a couple times because it was getting away from her and once I sorta had to block it and bounce it back to her and like 30 seconds later I see her jump to grab it and her whole body inverts!!!! Her head and torso disappeared!!! Literally!!! And her bare feet replaced them... SHE LITERALLY WENT RIGHT OVER THE RAILING ASSES AND ELBOWS!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I thought was she was not only dead but so were the 6 people she landed on... I was sorta in shock or something, I was trying to get up but that was only instinct, logic and common sense and everything other tripping balls emotion inside me said don't move.... The  tall guy was standing like a foot beside her when she flipped and he sorta jumped at her and I didn't realize it till later, but that should of worried me cause her momentum could of taken him too... but he's just looking down and frozen stiff too... finally I'm able to start to peel myself up and I will never forget the look on that kids face when he twisted his head from the base of his neck like the girl in the exorcist and he mouths \"help\" and I realize he caught her... but he only had her by the ankle with one hand... at that I flew up and got a hold of calf with both hands and ripped her straight up, he grabbed her dress and with that we had her back on our side of the railing all 3 sitting on the floor... I don't think he was breathing yet and I look at her and she's smiling away recreating the ball and trying to stand back up... I wrapped my arms around her and kissed her on the forehead and just about then I got blasted so hard from behind I almost knocked her back over... There was some sorta 3 man security SERT team or something... I'm 6'3\" 190lbs and I was the little guy... They grabbed her up and zip tied her and they drug her up the stairs and when I tried to protest they threatened to take all of us and told me to get the fuck back in my seat... They had to be off duty DC cops, cause they weren't rent a cops at all... and just like that it was gone and I realized they're playing Throwing Stones and the guy that caught her comes up to me and says, \"dude, you aren't going to believe what I thought I just saw...\" and he hugged me tight and I could feel he was literally trembling pretty hard... so was I too probably... but then the cool security guy from earlier had a partner and we were confined back into our seats... I guess we fucked up when we left to own accord and almost dropped our spinner girl and killed 3 people and critically injured 2 others... And I've always wondered, do you think that would of stopped the show or not?? I'm sure somewhere there are a bunch of sober people paying attention and probably seen that whole thing coming long before we did... Anyway, that day still wasn't done being weird... as I wonder out of the building after the show and get past the guy trying to tie dye all the clothes he found on floor inside for gas money and diapers I had to stop and get some more food, cold beer is scarce, but I saved some... I got back to the car and cleaned up and changed set out to mingle and the security were down telling the people down by the water where it goes under the bridge that if we stayed we couldn't leave till morning... they were allowing all night camping, wtf... It was really just a strange day from start to finish... I packed it in and headed back home to PA when i the traffic started to move a little better, so I'm not sure if they really did get to camp by the water all night or not, but I had had enough till that point and a 2.5 hour drive home... \nAnyway, say what will about that show compared to another and throw up this or that, I don't care, that was hands down the best show I was ever at!! and no one died!!\n\nOh yeah, I really just wanted to confirm that there were no chairs on the floor that night... Sorry for getting so long, but once I started listening to the show, I just had to share that... I dunno if anyone that was there seen any of what I described, but thanks to Big Data, it's now going to exist forever and maybe in a thousand years someone will get a hint of the flavor of what we got feast on... \nThanks for letting me share that... Peace out...",
