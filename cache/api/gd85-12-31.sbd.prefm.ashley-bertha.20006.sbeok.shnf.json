The suggestion was to begin clapping/stomping the rhythm to \"Not Fade Away\" as soon as the band hit the stage, to see if we could get them to bend to our desires. One glance at the setlist you'll see that we were indeed successful. \n\nThis was the only Grateful Dead New Year's show I attended, and is a special memory. The overall show was perhaps only a \"B\" (or 4 stars), but carries huge sentimental value. \n\nI seem to remember Bill Graham flying over the audience as Father Time or some such antic. Hard to see back through the fog of time. I also remember how my pal was getting harrassed by the heat and they were questioning him outside, which left me freakin' the scene by myself for the first part of the show. You'll all be happy to know they let him into the show even after confiscating his substance of choice. Methinks even cops surrender to the Greatful Dead New Year's vibe.\n\nAfter listening to the Dead circa 1971-1974 (which is 80% of my Grateful Dead diet), this just isn't as vital or jaunty. Jerry sounds tired, strung out, and weak. But the magic is still there, and this is worthy of download, especially if you were there.",

Great energy from the crowd, and a valiant effort by the band, but they seemed a bit ragged by the end of the year. \n\nThe one thing I really like from this show is the Throwing Stones. I know, I know. But I really like the tone they hit with this one, and I like Bobby's treatment of the lyrics. The weariness of it at the end strikes me as approppriate, as I was a bit weary of the things going on in the rest of the world in the 80s that prompted this song.\n\nGive it a listen.

      "review_text": "woefully un-reviewed NYE show while  a bit up and down, IMHO this is a great new year's show.  and there aren't many of those as most of us realize.  \ni'm not sure what the fella down there's talking about when he asks where jer's vocal is.  it's right where it always was in '85 -- a bit low in the mix bit still emotive as hell.... just listen to 'black peter!'  \nanyway, first set highlights include a very ripping 'cassidy,' nice and tight with plenty of phil and bob d'oh-ing the lyrics (at least brent's got his back), a sweet 'brown-eyed' and the killer closer, 'let it grow,' which is really unbelievable.  i'm not sure i've ever heard them as tight during the two breakdowns in this tune.  and jerry just rips in this version.  if you know anything about me, you know i'm kind of a red-ass, not your typical head.  i don't give a rip about tye dye (anymore) or hippies or partying -- i just care about the music and the recording.  suffice it to say, i think i've downloaded one  show for every 10 or 12 that i listen to.  when i say jerry rips it in 'let it grow,' i freaking mean it.  and the rest of the band is practically crawling up his ass -- it's that good.  still gives me goosebumps and i've had a tape of this show since i recorded it off the radio, nye 1985!\nset two opens with a great 'midnight hour,' motown style, bob and brent trading on the \"wait wait wait\" nicely.  'sugaree' with jerry once again ripping it up.  then.  finally.  we get to the 'playing,' the whole reason i'm writing this review. after the vocal is done, the band collectively seems to take a deep breath, phil exhaling first with a couple of sweet bass runs and then WHAM!  jerry with a most amazing descending guitar line, slow and provocative.  i heard a tribute on npr's \"fresh air\" after jerry died and they (it might have been david gans) used this solo to illustrate jerry's style.  and i also believe it was used on the 'so far' movie.  it's amazing.\n'terrapin' is great, the 'truckin' is passable (not one of my faves), but the 'black peter' is spot on perfect.  even when jerry's voice was gone, it sure was good on the weepers and this is no exception.  a rare spot for it, late in set 2, but beautiful, regardless.  'throwing stones' is great as well with some particularly great drumming.  and, as another reviewer mentioned, gloriously not oversung by bobby.  it's as plaintive and melancholy as i've ever heard him.  he sounds tired of it all, but full or energy at the same time.  it hink this is when TS finally gelled for him.\nanyway, great show (and great recording), especially for a NYE .\n\nPS - great point, hoohah!  i'm not sure what i was thinking there.... the weeper slot is always late, set 2!  sorry if i led anyone astray....",

While it is mid 80's Dead with Jerry tired and practically not moving on stage (watch the tape), there are some nice moments, with Midnight Hour, Terrapin, and Black Peter as highlights. Worth the listen.",

It just sets the tone for the second set like you would not believe!  The craziest , haziest rambling diatribe I ever heard on any tape I had in my collection of Dead shows.  Must be heard in full to fully appreciate the madness Kesey embodied!This always was one of my all time favorite bootlegs EVER!!.....The second set is absolutely incredible--the first ain't no slouch, either.  What a great way to end 1985, one of the most incredible years the band gave us in their history.  Thank you,  Thank you. Thank you!",

      "review_text": "PPV, no, wait <br />The NYE run was moved to the Oakland Coliseum (from San Fran) at this point and, because of its size, was cut to only two days. It did come after an actual run at the  Kaiser (notable\u2014especially 11/21). The next year, post-coma, the NYE run was AT the Kaiser; then came back here for '87. The show is quite uptempo for '85 (the year Jer finally quit dancing and moonwalking all over the stage and started concentrating his boundless energies on just playing!), but, notoriously, the second set went out on the USA network as their NYE special. Parts were also used for the <b>So Far</b> video. I was remembering it as PPV, the reason being that few people HAD the USA network at that time so we were invited to this dude's house (that had a dish or cable or summat) for a shindig. Unfortunately they didn't go live until the second set, at which point this cat's National Guard roommate and drunken friends came home and started telling us how stupid the Dead were and trying to change the channel. This devolved into a stupid Heads vs. Hawks argument on the nature of war (their stance being that war was human and peace was not the natural state of things - \"Nothing was ever solved with peace so what's so great about it?\"). We vowed to be in Oakland in person the next year.\n\nA group of Heads had passed out flyers in the lots which read:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the band comes onstage, let's show them our\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0appreciation by chanting, \"You know our love will not fade away.\" \nWhich is why the band catches the groove (how many audiences can even clap in unison?) and opens with a Not Fade>Touch. The night was hosted by Ken Kesey, Father Guido Sarducci, Tom Davis and Grateful Red, variously, on FM and TV. Kesey was a nut and Sarducci was hilarious. They cut in at the NY countdown with Bill Graham on the float and the faces of the band on the side. Then Kesey started shouting,\"There's no describing it! It makes Blake look like Charles Schulz. It's a representation of the USS Merrimack! I see John Lennon and Wagner. Wagner himself!  This must have cost millions! IT'S FDR!!! IT's FDR!!!\" A skeptical (read: slightly more sober) Sarducci interjected, \"Eet looks-a like Tom Petty.\" Unswayed, Kesey continued, \"It's Sam the Eagle from The Muppets! Eric Clapton! Eric Clapton himself!\". Kesey is witnessing an entirely different event.\nSarducci: \"Uh, that's-a not Eric Clapton...\"\nKesey: \"Then Frank Zappa! It must be Frank Zappa...Rasputin! Rasputin is here...It's FDR, Rasputin and Eric Clapton!!!\"\nHoo man, sizzlin' on the air! \n\nIf you went to a NYE show you probably suss a different vibe than if you're just listening to the show for the first time. Still, this one has good moments, as others have mentioned; but there were better 80s NYE shows. For those of you unfamiliar: The NYE was a big party with a private feel because tix were so hard to get. It took all day to get in, get good seats and get through the opening bands, then the Dead played until the following wee hours. At midnight Graham would trigger some extravaganza such as flying on wires, always while dressed as father time, tossing roses to the heads, with fireworks, hundreds of balloons falling from the ceiling and doves would be released. Big freaking parties, they were. A long-ass night out. It was the place to be and the shows weren't really about technical musical excellence. Though from today's lens we can certainly evaluate the show musically, critically, for listening purposes.\n\nFirst Set. They set off at a crazy tempo. You can hear Jer yelling at the drummers to slow down several times during the set. At under an hour it's pretty short for 1st set but there's already been two opening performers and two more sets to come. The crowd-sourced <i>Not Fade>Touch of Grey</i> segue is priceless, though it's hard to put fills in the song at this tempo! Pretty ironic for a band that could be so curmudgeonly sluggish at times. It WAS played in a faster arrangement from late '85 to '87, but this is one of THE fastest. When Jer doesn't have to sing he whiplashes a hot solo. A temperamental <i>Tons of Steel</i> is one of only five in '85 and the first since April. We were still getting tapes labeled \"900000 Tons\" at the time. The rest is average '85 with the set peaking at a hot <i>Brown-Eyed Women</i>. Bobby also admonishes the drummers (albeit more subtly) going into <i>Let it Grow</i>, for playing too uptempo and putting their shoes in the dryer for an entire set (note that the Bertha source has the dry feed here while others do not).\n\nSecond Set. The first standout is a fantastic <i>Sugaree</i> - most of the rest is average '85. The <b>So Far</b> video segues in to this <i>Playing>Lady with a Fan</i> from a taped band practice  because it's a hot, uptempo version (Playin' was great at the time and there's another classic on 11/10). The video skips ahead from this busy, uptempo, but undramatic <i>Terrapin</i> to <i>Space</i> (the drummers, with Baba Olatunji, stay on). \"Just like a Swiss watch,\" Bobby proclaims as they drop into <i>Black Peter</i>. A meta moment? Because <i>Throwing Stones</i> is a fight - a struggle - and they don't recover until Olatunji helps with a solid <i>Brokedown</i>. Oddly, they play Stones into (a second) NFA, as per usual. Double encore, but no third set.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3 Stars\n\nHighlights:\nNFA>Touch of Grey - Unusual crowd-fed segue into a time-smeared Touch\nSugaree - One of the few songs to benefit from the speeding drummers - Jer digs it\nPlayin' - The version picked for the vid\n\nSOURCES: The best copy to emerge, by far, is the miller_78054 (except there's a gap in Let it Grow, and glitches in Playing and Space, so go to the Bertha_20006 source for those), however it runs <u>too fast and needs -1% pitch for the first set and -2% for the first two songs of the second set </u>. Even some of the FM sources are too fast and most of the AUDs run even faster. FM_sbd_113739 has the Father Sarducci commentary, which is usually on Youtube with the second set.

Well, first things first, the band was as HIGH as we were.  And I was pretty damn high that night.  Love the tye-dye crowd effect from the Gondola at the top of the arena.  Full oil bubble show, full projection screens.  Just beautiful.  Everybody I hear bitching about the show I didn't see you at section 223 using the scoreboard as a rolling tray or for linskies.  A lot of my very good friends we had an \"f\"ing blast partying with each other.  Went back stage, and everyone was as high as we were that we ran into.  Great Full Service Bar.  The highlight of the show was when the band just stopped and the crowd sang to them.  You should have seen the looks on their faces.  I'd like to see anybody bitching about it do 1/10th as good of a job half as high as we were that night.\n\nFor those of you in the know it's called \"sealed for your protection\".\n\nLogan",

      "review_text": "Not Fade Away!!! If you were not around for '85 shows, you need to somehow get a look at this one. It was on the USA network (audio - FM stations). \n\nThis New Year's show is underrated. Sure it's not '76 or '78, but it is a 20 song show that is solid from start to finish.\n\nIf you can get the Father Garducci (sp?) segment, please do. It is funny and he did a great job with that style of humor.\n\nNot Fade is pulsating and takes you right into the show. Interestingly, the Touch that follows is gentle and like a bird on the shoulder. Bob's blues repitoire was more diversified in '85. He did Bottom>Superstitious, Walking the Dog (with Jerry) and Kansas City (twice). But he stays with the standard C.C. Rider (how soon after that song would be dumped, no?). Cassidy is great, as is Brown-Eyed Woman. But the Let it Grow closer is a tumbling, noodling gem. Great guitar work by 'ol Jer.\n\nIt's Bob's night - as you will hear/see when you check this out. Midnight Hour, Playin', Truckin', an Apocalyptic Throwing Stones. And then back into Not Fade Away. The band stops - but the crowd didn't!!!Resulting in one of the more interesting versions. \n5 stars (Actually 4 and 1/2 for 1985 standards).",
