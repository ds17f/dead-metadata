I was crushed when I was told they opened Shakedown. Lucky for me there were a lot of great musical moments to come later in the show, which in my opinion is one of the finest of 93. The pre-drums second set in particular and the Lucy of course was great fun. At least I can listen to the Shakedown now thanks to archive and all the contributors.",

The fact that the show went on was a teste a ment to everyone who was able to make it there form whichever corner of the globe they did...a daunting task some may remember.  The energy transferred well, as the feeling was special and high.  The end result was the supposed presence of both/either Slick Willy and/or Al Bore. Jr.  Both fans of the band, we heard from many they were present.\n\nLSD was special - the song, silly.  After a Dark Star, nothing like a GD world premiere of a classic few dare to touch.  They did it justice, as you will (may have already) hear(d).  \n\nLandover was a special place over the period of the early 90s...at this annual juncture, it had replaced Hampton (and its amazements) on the East spring swing. They pulled much out here over the shows of this time.  \n\nA classic, no doubt, but only of this later phase.  There are periods of high art, but they are not as sustained as they were when it was purer (pre-\"Touch of Grey\"). Overall strong playing, but the starting-stopping interupted any strong flows.  Second set did go as one sequence, but it took a while to get it to that flooring level we all seek.",

      "review_text": "Uneven on St. Patrick's Day This show has some weird juju.  It was *bitterly* cold in the DC area, late season snow/ice had blanketed the area for most of March and if it was 30 degrees that day, I didn't feel it.  But you are not reading this review for the weather report, but I am trying to frame the show in its context.\n\nAs for the band, VW had been solo keyman for about 1 year and I was side stage for this show.  The Shakedown opener is hot and well jammed, fortelling what you might think would be a smoking first set, but you would be wrong.  Like much of the latter era, the pace does not sustain.  While Bob and Vince stetch Wang Dang nicely and Jerry gives a great reading of Lazy River Road (a personal late era favorite), the set bogs down after that.  The Desolation Row drags endlessly, like some musical version of Atlas Shrugged and at least on this copy, Ramble on cuts out mid stream, picking up about 4 minutes into Eterni-Cheez.  All possibly remaining air is taken out of the set with a limp \"Liberty\" set closer.  3 new tunes in one set.  Ouch babe.  If this were 1977 and it was estimated and terrapin they were road testing every other night, who would complain, but the problem here is that the songs are out of place.  Eternity is *not a terrible song, but sticking it toward the end of the first set instead of say, out of space or into drums makes it unbearable.\n\nSet 2 is a similarly mixed bag.  Picasso, not a personal favorite is none the less well played as is Crazy fingers, with JG laying down some nice leads.  Playin is a nice showcase for Vince but it cuts at about 7 min. or so to Dark Star, which just isn't what it was even when they busted it out in '89.  The post verse jam is decent, but a flaccid 90 second intro shows that the band was just not *there* anymore with this tune.  The Drums>Space segment is very good, with a 2 Soldiers jam after space that melts into a good Other One.  But here again, a new and uneven Days Between into good lovin.  The LSD encore is usually a reference point for this show, but honestly, it would have been better off being performed by Vince than Jerry, who just doesn't have the vocal range (esp. the high end) for this song.  \n\nHate to flame ANY dead show, much less one I attended, but the 3 stars is generous esp. since there is an aforementioned cut in the show during the first set.",

Kinda odd that in the middle of a fairly cookin Playin jam Jer all of a sudden does the Dark Star intro, which is great, but this version really doesn't go anywhere, and Jer is the first one to head backstage leaving the others holding the bag. Nice short jam w/o Jer. LSD was fun at the time. I have a AUD tape of this and it's funny how the crowd is so energized but the show doesn't match the intensity.",

      "review_text": "Crazy Day to Crazy Fingers As people have already posted about this concert, the weather was nuts.  DC was slammed with snow and anyone from the area knows that 1 inch of snow in DC causes chaos.  Imagine a lot more.  Anyway, I have great memories of this concert.  I got into the Dead late in their career.  You can blame that on my parents because they didn't have me until the mid 70s.  Anyway, this was probably my 5th show and although i am jealous of all the people who saw them back when they had energy and went nuts, I cannot compare.  I write this as a review of late shows and only have them to compare with.\n\nI lived in the DC area and I always enjoyed RFK shows over the Cap Center.  There was always less atmosphere at the Cap Center, and it just didn't have the \"Huge\" feel that RFK gave.  For this concert, I did score great seats.  Probably the best I have ever had and that probably played into my bias of this concert.  I sat about 10 rows back and had an unbelievable view.  Being on St. Patty's day made this all the more fun.\n\nThe set list was average for the most part, but some moments just made this memorable.  Kicking the show off with Shakedown was fun.  It got the crowd all geeked up for a great show, but they faded a little fast and the show lost momentum.  Playing in the Band to Dark Star was a bit unusual for me, but Jerry did a great job with this.  Of course Dark Star to Drums/Space always works in my book.  I do want to highlight Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  When this started the crowd (me included) went nuts.  This was a treat to hear.  Everyone was singing as loud as they could and the energy hit a high for the night.  That one song is worth listening to whole show.\n\nI am a big fan of Days Between and it always comes late in the shows I have seen... and this concert was no different.  I prefer to end on an upbeat tone, so i would like Days to be earlier, but hey... it's their call.  I wasn't thrilled with Good Lovin as the finale, but it was still good.\n\nI think this show was much better in person and doesn't translate well to recording, but the memories of the weather, the songs, and the view really made this concert stick out a ton for me.  The people who did not attend will probably see this as a 3 star show, but for those who were fortunate to attend, I am sure their recolection improves their view.  Enjoy it.  I certainly did.  Especially because a nice guy behind us help improve our state :)",

Jerry really anunciates on the Lazy River Road - it's pretty neat. The Desolation gets going at times too - \"Except for Bill and Mickey\" instead of \"Except for Cain and Abel\", as well as \"Ezra Pound and Bill and Mickey\" instead of \"Ezra Pound and TS Eliot\" on the Desolation!

      "review_text": "There were Days This show has a singular feel to it, all of the new 1st set stuff perhaps more compelling live then taped now, but it felt like the Dead were surging to a new jazzier space, going further, getting 'better'....Oh well, was wrong on that one. Anyhoo, the true cool is the 2nd set, with a frisky 'Picasso' leading into a somewhat disorganized, energyless couple of songs, redeemed by a Jerryless jam from 'Dark Star' into drums. The show achieves its status from the post space segment, with a sweetly rendered nod to St. Patty in an instrumental 'Handsome Cabin Boy', into a freakin sweet 'Other One', which utilizes excellent ensemble play, not long on the frenetic energy of a typical good one, but really nice and well played. Sorry for the self indulgence, but it needs to be said that the 'OO' jam was heightened by white spotlights striking like lightning throughout the arena in perfect time with the notes eminating from Jer's guitar, spectacular. Strange effects on Ace's vocals, this show had high production value. Yea, I know, yawn. Then, in a moment of such stupendous beauty that I forgot to breathe, drooling all over my tie-dye, a blue halo of light shimmered around Garcia as they entered 'Days Between', for my money, the best version that exists. Studio styled, with minimalist playing, nice Vince chording and tasteful Phil punctuation, Jerry absolutely represents, and belts this song out with unbelievable soul and conviction. Jerry the balladeer at a peak, no doubt. Take that, Torme, step off, Sinatra. A bopping Phil heavy Lovin, and then, wow, Lucy in the Sky. This was the run that gave me hope n '95, after all, 92 pretty much blew, but Spring '93 was a serious bounce back. Who knew? Spring '96 coulda been sick. Ah well, I can wank by myself, thanks for reading. If anyone has a 'Days' that is superior, please do tell...",

I love 'The Days Between'. Jerry rules. This song was always special. This and 'So Many Roads' were so powerful (Jerry's Last Ballads for the world).\n\nQuality of the recording is excellent. All instruments are well mixed. Cymbals are there. Phil is strong. I do not hear the hiss referred to.",

I went by myself to this run just planning on running the VW van down no matter what just broken hearted and blessed and bleeding needing to do shows back when I was basically finding my entire yearly calendar based around the northeast runs and whatever else I could get my hands on during 'those days'- yes I know BUT this show, being a Dark Star show...I know I'm getting to the show story...anyway here we go....\n\nSo I'm packed up and ready and the night before I'm leaving (no hotel just a van) I see on the TV that Washington, DC is about to have the largest amount of snow ever in history about to be dumped upon it...I figure what the hell if I pack a couple extra down comforters and a blanket I may be able to stay warm et all and since I had been to the CAP center in '89 for the Phil B-day I'm like a thing like snow ain't holding this freak back so I get on the freeway and head south in the VW as fast as I can get there....\n\nFirst night- sick I can't remember where I stayed but I know I slept somewhere.\n\nSecond night- \"Dark Star\"- I think it was my 5th ever or something anyway I'm creeped out after the show cause there's so much snow on the ground- I pull into this campground its about 2am and I'm freezing my loins off if you know what I mean.  So anyway I start up the space heater in the van and fall asleep and the next thing I know I wake up and the frickin' down comforter that is on top of me has burst in to flames!@   Anyway I lived to tell about it and thanks god I didn't burn to death but if I said I wasn't scared I'd be lying- BUT I'd do it all over again just to catch a show that sounds like this....Dark Star shows were the best I ever saw....there's a story for ya!-\n\nPeace, pot and you know what...\n\nMy feet damn near froze off on the ride home after the third night but I made it.....(PVD)= :)\n\nI give this 4 stars because it was so much snow and freezing cold and fire on the bed...thanks archive.org",

      "review_text": "Handsome Cabin Boy The theme of the jam coming out of space is without a doubt \"Handsome Cabin Boy\".  If one listens to the Shady Grove version it is obvious, not to mention that it was most likely around this time that Garcia and Grisman were working on this track (can't confirm that though but judging from the recording dates and release date it seems plausible); \"Two Soldiers\" would have been cut pre-1991 or earlier.  Good recording, enjoyable.  I like the road stories too...chill...no rules here.  Happy St. Patrick's Day!!! http://larkspirit.com/hungerstrikes/diary.html#17th  \nLest we forget!!  Thanks Bobby for the deadication on 5/5/81!",

      "review_text": "1993 Gem This show stood out for me for the set list, playing that night, the venue and especially the climate outside.  I grew up in the area so this venue was like home and very different than the open air circus that was RFK, and very different then Philly, Jersey, or NYC inside shows. It was fun to see them on St Pattys day and the poor weather made us feel \"hardcore\", lol. The set list was especially solid as a Shakedown for me is a fun way to kick off a show and the jammin was true and really got heavier as the night went on, especially culminating with The other one.  Phil seemed especially front and center during the second set. That could have been due to our seats located on his side, about 10 rows out, and that his birthday was just two days ago. I recall he smiled alot this evening and interplayed with the band more than normal, IMHO.  Fun show to listen to now, as many that I saw from the mid 80's till the end were not so good when played back. ;  )  PS - Too bad to read comments like Scarlet Fire dude, spitting venom on folks who share memories here, and not comment like were are reviewing a piano recital.  I aways felt half the fun of a dead show was the people, venue, weather, and just the whole adventure.  I wouldn't have gone to a second show if the music sucked, but I wouldn't have gone to as many as I did if it wasn't for the experience.",

I had been seeing the Dead for about 4 years or so at this point and this night proved to be a Dark Star.  Of all the Grateful Dead shows I caught, I will, to this day, say that the BEST shows I caught were on Dark Star nights, starting in Sept 1990 at the Garden (holy mackerel).  Anyway, thank you to whoever posted this.   I would like to comment on the person who was talking about the weather for these shows in an earlier post.  I was alone in my van at the KOA after this run...had a down comforter, and a space heater.  I woke up with my blankets on fire.....the van is still in the garage lmao.  I love you god damn people!  Happy 50th enjoy the hell out of it!!!\n",

Playin-Dark Star-drums-TOO!  Dude!   I remember during Good Lovin, Jerry turned to his side, grinned and let out out a \u201cYEAH!\u201d. He was having fun. It was a good night.   I like to believe he was looking right at me. Felt like it.  The NFA stomp then Jerry stepping up to sing \u2026picture yourself\u2026. The place exploded and he nailed this one. I heard the first couple of bites and was like no way. Please be Jerry, and it was. 50th anniversary of Dr. Hofmann\u2019s potion. All was right with the world. ",
