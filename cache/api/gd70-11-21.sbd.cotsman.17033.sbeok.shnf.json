I actually like the way this tape sounds in the same way I like the way my 9th generation tape of 5-2-70 sounds: distorted to the max like some of those early Ash Ra Tempel Private Tapes.\n\nThis is seriously hot stuff and what's great is that you can tell it's going to be good from the first fifteen seconds of Cryptical.  Both Jerry and Bobby are singing like they mean it ...\n\nWill someone please upload the audience tape of the Merced, CA show?  I don't want to do it myself because I still haven't forgiven Bob \"Money, Money, Money\" Weir for his bad behavior.",

It was scary as hell. I saw a policeman disappear under the crowd. I was almost impaled by a bit brace as I was pushed over a speaker. \nI managed to stay for the show;-)#). The trained chimps was, to this day, the strangest thing I ever saw at a concert. The NROPS were great, as were the Dead. It was my favorite Dead concert. I was standing right in front of the stage. I remember Dark Star, the Eleven and Uncle Johns Band. It was my favorite weekend, ever, because I saw the Allman Brothers at the Tea Party Friday Night.",

      "review_text": "Fa70- Ned's first complete show Snippet of what was probably an excellent show in the fall of 70. Apparently a chimp act opened, as did the New Riders play. Ned - per usual in 1970/71 - can't quite be found on the recording. Phil sounds sweet and bouncy for the return of Cryptical. Likely will not be revisiting this one, though. Too little, here, from the show and the audio is much too flawed.",

It actually wasn\u2019t played that often in surviving shows \u2013 only 20 times in 1969, and 15 times in 1970 (though undoubtedly more performances are missing). Never a very frequent song, the Dead were playing it even less in fall 1970; it doesn\u2019t even turn up in audience memories of lost shows. By that point, the Cryptical reprise (when played) was more likely to segue to Sugar Magnolia, and the Dead seem to have been losing interest in Cosmic Charlie.\n\n\nThere's a lot more information on the history of cosmic Charlie in the article",
