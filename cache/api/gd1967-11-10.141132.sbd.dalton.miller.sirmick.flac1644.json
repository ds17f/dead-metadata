I don't have a favorite version yet, but this became one of several favorites as soon as I was half-way through hearing it for the first time. \nMorning Dew is a solid early version, very satisfying. I'm not big on GML Schoolgirl, but this version is excellent, at least as good as 2-14-68. Alligator is a primo, outstanding rendition featuring Mickey on congas, just like the following night. Everyone buy yourselves a really good desktop audio system, and save this web address for your streaming pleasure!",

      "review_text": "Primary source deadography <br />These shows were billed as the \"Amazing Electric Wonders\" concert. Along with \"Dance and marvel each night, each night\", posters mistakenly posted showtime as  9am to 1pm nightly, conceivably upsetting kids that came on their bikes that morning. The openers were Blue Cheer then the Dead, ahead of Buffalo Springfield. The Cheer were in L.A. recording their first album, but already had regional buzz about their live show. The briefly extant Springfield were at their peak, having just had their hit single and a high profile appearance at Monterey Pop (where they went on <i>before</i> the Dead). Neil had left the band several times by this point and Crosby had been stepping in for live gigs (their second album, out the next week, has three solo tracks from Neil).\n\nThis was Mickey's 4th or 5th show. It's good in a proto way. Jer's fretwork is repetitious within songs and he's still reusing licks show to show, but Bobby is expanding quickly and Phil is more aggressive than earlier in the year. Pig holds his own on organ throughout. 1hr45mins is a big set for an opening band. Stills & Furay were probably standing aside going \"WTF, guys?!\". Before the official release we had a partial SBD (missing BioDtL, Caboose, and the complete Viola), and a long-standing confusion between this and the next night, with songs from both circulating with either date (including a wrong date on 30 Days of Dead). Parts of this show were the first to be chopped for live track usage on <b>Anthem</b>. Luckily Healy ran two decks at the time (they were in an L.A. studio this week, also accumulating the studio portions of the album).\n\nThe quality <i>Viola Lee</i> is revealed on the multi-track version -  part of the excitement is being able to hear Phil and Bobby's playing so clearly. <i>Beat it On Down the Line</i>-10 runs on the extra Jer licks. The beauty contest winner is <i>Morning Dew</i>; the best example of a '67. The final sequence has a wonderful first half. <i>Cryptical</i> is still brand new - it's probably the 3rd one. <i>The Other One</i> is peak '67. The reprise <i>Cryptical</i> relies on stock licks. <i>Caboose</i> is the 4th one we have, but had likely been played a dozen times since premiering in August. Here you can tell how much it sounded like it could be on After Bathing at Baxter's (the beginning is clipped on the SBD). The <i>Alligator</i> is healthy (turn on the hippies leave the heat alone). You'll recognize <b>Anthem</b> @15:10 in the frenzied but onanistic <i>Caution</i>. SBDs have a 13sec gap near the end of <i>Feedback</i>.\n\nOverall = B- \u00a0\u00a03\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nMorning Dew - best example of era version\nThe Other One - X factored\n\nSOURCES: The official release is super clear, from multi-track. It's on both <b>30 Trips</b> and <b>Shrine Exposition Hall</b> vinyl (with Caution spread over two sides). Viola Lee is on <b>The Definitive Live Story</b>. The 141132_sbd_dalton is the slightly repitched SBD, with a wider image. The sacks_1612 has the channels switched and is missing New Potato. The 1967-11-11_116172_sbd is partially (mistakenly) from this date. Some sources circulated with a Neal Cassady rap from 7/23/67. A section of Caution is on <b>Anthem</b>.",

      "review_text": "Yep, this is 5-plus stars This summer I've been mostly listening to 1969, with some various excursions (1981, 1972, 1968)... but I am happy to report that this 1967 show is crazy fuggin good!\n\nViola Lee-- C'mon, a 15-minute version of a classic pre/Primal Dead performance and song, with classic primal Viola Lee Jerry? Yes please! I love this song for a lot of reasons, including Garcia's rapid-fire solos during the theme jams, as well as the inevitable \"meltdowns\". This version is sans meltdown, but has everything else including some gorgious group harmonies. Love it!\n\nHurts me Too-- Honestly, just as satisfying as any '72 version. Classic Pig/Jerry/rhythm section stuff here\n\nMorning Dew-- I actually usually skip over this song, if I'm in a good personal mood, but based on one of the reviews I read below I decided to give it a whirl. Verdict: Heck yeah, this is very good. Faster tempo, but more Baroque than even the Barton Hall version I typically compare Dews to. I like this, including the \"Tuning\" before the song, at the end of Hurts Me Too. (This actually reminds me of a Playing in the Band tuning/semi-jam)\n\nSchoolgirl--- Well see, usually I almost always skip over this tune, because (A) I know it so well, and (B) there usually isn't much variation between versions. It's about ten minutes long, Pigpen sings and half-raps, and that's it. This version happens to be pristine, and I dug the ever-slowing tempo at the end. Great sound quality, and some diggin' Jerry riffs in the middle of it. Best ever version?... I have no idea. It's good enough to listen to, and I enjoyed it. (Surprisingly.)\n\nCryptical > TOO > Cryptical Reprise-- Oh heck yeah, this hits all the marks. Amazing sounding recording, vicious attack/performance, and a segue into New Potato Caboose > Alligator > Caution? FUGG to the YEAH!\n\nNew Potato-- Seems like a lot of folks who comment on the Archive don't like this song very much, which I find strange. This is certainly a very good version. (** I still wonder who played those tinkling notes..It reminds me of a Brent-era synthesizer, but I refuse to accept this as a possibility). Frankly, New Potato Caboose, if it had the Beach Boys harmonies, would have been as big a hit as Good Vibrations: great harmony vocals, psychedelic almost beachy flavor, and just overall near-perfection.)\n\nAlligator-- Okay, I'm no Alligator expert. But this version is smokin' hot. Best version ever, probably not... the Boys were pretty freakin' hot between 68-71, when this song was in the rotation. But Top 10? I would HAVE to think so. Wow. Wow-wow-wow\n\nCaution (Do Not Step on the Tracks)-- I can't recall exactly how many full Cautions I have listened to over the years. Probably less than a dozen, because... it's, well, sort of a matter of taste. This one killed it for me, I love this version. I actually saved it to disk for future end of world listening. \n\nOverall-- 5 stars for the sound, 5 stars for the show itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to this show at some point..\n\n(Note: there is another copy of this show on the Archive which breaks down the individual song-lets, and also has an inexplicable Neal Cassady rap from three months earlier. Which is cool if you haven't heard that Neil rap before, otherwise I think the minuscule gaps between \"songlets\" is distracting and the filler material only disturbs the flow. I prefer and recommend this source.)\n\n",

      "review_text": "Truly Warlocks Well I guess they took my review down, probably for talking too much about magic and associated potions lol.  Busted for smiling on a cloudy day!!!  But yeah, this Caution is truly wizard music.  I was in the zone a few years ago around a fire in my yard with the system turned up, and my meditative zen state combined with the absolute volcanic eruption at the end of Caution literally made a log at the edge of the pit burst into flames out of nowhere, precisely in time with the music. Then Pig tells us that all you need is a touch of that Mojo Hand, which is literally magic witchcraft. (the good kind) This is portal stuff, Buckle Up Kidz!!!  (And yes, if you're ever in Sebastopol ask some heads if they know Erik who lived on Trixie's mountain and we can have a sesh lol)  ",
