This is not my favorite era for the Dead, not least because I don't particularly like a lot of the songs that were in heavy rotation around this time.  BUT... this little beauty features versions of two of those songs (Alabama Getaway and Passenger) that have me rethinking my opinions of them.  Both are played waaay beyond any version I've heard before.  \n\nJerry's voice is actually in decent shape for this show as well, which helps.  Finally, the recording is exquisite.\n\nIf you're into this era, download it NOW.  If not, give it a listen and then download it.",

      "review_text": "The Wildest, Most Intense Show I Ever Saw !!! They started out blazing and just burned the house down. Saying \"they were ON\" doesn't come close to describing it.  Probably the only time C.C. Rider ever went 2X.  Bird Song's jam is gorgeous >  Let It Grow is a short, intense monster.  I thought Phil's thundering vibration during - a way waayyy over the top - Passenger was going to bring the arena roof down, his bombs were shaking the place so much.  It was actually SCARY (my friends and I were all staring at the ceiling wondering if we were going to die.) Thankfully, it held up and we were privilaged to live another day. :-) The Sailor > Saint is the best they ever did - without a question.   I hear this type of pronouncement of songs constantly so, in qualifying this without hearing every single version they ever did, I mean that I don't know HOW they could have done it any better? The build-up is just incredible.  And the release is truely orgasmic.  One moment you can not hear on the SBD is the overly exuberant crowd reaction to the highest point in Let It Grow.  No, it wasn't the unbelieveable intesity the song came to but, right at the crescendo, some crazy fool switched on ALL the stadium floods, and the place was bright as day for maybe ten seconds.  It was a very unexpected and perfectly timed happening to \"let it grow\".\n\nWhat else can I say folks, I just stood there in shock and awe, with my jaw on the floor three-quarters of the evening. The Compendium comes pretty close to accurately describing it.  They were manically tight all night.  And they were speedballing on something... God knows what it was? I have the SBD so I haven't tried downloading.  But I prefer my so-so, overly-saturated AUD to the SBD anyway.  Beg, Borrow, or steal a good FOB if you can ever find one... and let me know.  Please.  I'm praying The Archive may come up with one someday because the SBD is sterile and lifeless. The crowd makes the show even goofphyier than the stuff The Boyz were doing that night.  Recently I put the show through some heavy reverb filtering in Sound Forge and the SBD sounds a lot better.  SBDs can be harsh at times and the reverb softens the marginal singing quite nicely. 7.13.13 \n\nAddendum to original 8.09.04 post:  Dear Al.  Wow!  I've heard of another Wise recording that is a bit problematic but, Jez!?  Another - uncirculated - AUD (hopefully close FOB.)  That would be something!  Well Alex.  What can I say besides THANK YOU !!!  Though, when I first saw the notes on Doug's position, my heart sank a tad.  I know how iffy B.O.B.s can be so, I was a little worried.  With my positive energy vibes and nimble EQ fingers at the ready, I prayed his shotguns might surprise me ala the 5.5.81 Glen Falls show.  Happily, the stream sounds pretty damn good with only a modicum of air. Phew.  Brent's \"tinkle tinkle\" is fairly bright, and there is enough there to play around with in Sound Forge for my own listening specs.  This \"full\" recording is head over heals better than my oversaturated copy...and a world away from the SBD.  ...After twenty four years of waiting...  Thanks again bro.",

      "review_text": "How About The Wheel? \nThis show is full of the highest octane, most high energy playing I ever heard from the Grateful Dead. Many songs this evening contain great & even 'best' or 'favorite' versions' for me.\n\nStarting with the double-time CC Rider out of nowhere halfway through the song (we were at a total loss at the time and thought perhaps they had started Sugar Mag for an intstant in fact). The jam in CC Rider smokes & I will guarentee you no other version comes close.\nA great Cumberland & sweet El Paso, what more can you want? Well, we got it: The ripping Passenger - show me a better one, followed by a sweeter than sweet Birdsong when the song was upbeat & actually sounded like a bird in flight instead of Dark Star at it's slower pace from the late 80's/early 90's (not that that this was such a bad thing, lol). They finish off things with the best, most shredded Let It Grow I have ever heard: Just the best first set I've ever seen.\n\nThe second set features a great Shakedown, a fantasic second set Big Railroad in the Ship of fools slot (how's that for an upgrade?.)  A fairly average Playin for the time that features some inspired playing by Jerry near the end that reminds me of ripples of water going outward on a starlit lake that is quite impressive but shortly dissolves into the drums.\n\nAs for Lost > Saint, I must say I was damn sick and tired of it by now after 50 shows in 80/'81, of which about half saw 15 minutes of valuable time wasted shilling this duo for record sales for Go To Heaven. Therefore, I'll let others critique it. I will say that it always sounds good on tape these days (but still remarkably similar version to version). We were quite shocked when Bob screamed \"What the F*CK you gonna do now!\" at the end of Saint though......\n\nThe post drums sees the GD at their finest.....\n\nAn eerie space is just the start of the period in which the band had been playing some much improved space compared to the previous two years (Dec ember '81-'Spring '82). It's really amazing ~ Hints of 'Jaws' in there...... The Space hits a peak at the end that is incredible with Jerry playing some sc athing notes that almost reach 'The Tiger' before dropping into.. THE Wheel...\n\n The Wheel that follows is just epic, again, the greatest ever, imho.\n\n This version goes on & on, building, Jerry building up the most intense & tastey intro & finally, after almost 4 minutes, the singing begins.\n\nThe jam out leads into a sweet & extended Playing Reprise, one of the first of the Wheel > Playin'  combination..\n\nOf note, it's the very first time the band extends the Playin reprise in years, a practice they continue the rest of their career. Then a Stella with a superb ending I've never heard topped. (which only left me wondering what a Morning Dew would've been like on this night of extriordinary playing). They finish things off with a tremendous (if vocally chasllenged) Sugar Mag, which was a huge surprise, consideing they had been ending every show on a Saturday the previous 7 months with Sat Night (boy did my friend Dave give me grief over that, but that's another story).\n\nAll & all, from the start to the end, one of the best GD shows I ever saw & the playing on just about every song is off the hook. 5*'s.\n\nAdded thoughts, 11/39/13:\n\n\nBTW: Nobody mentions security.. They were jocks from Indiana U I believe. In any case, they would not allow dancing ~ my friend was thrown out during Cumberland Blues as I slunk away...\n\nWe couldn't resist during the incendiary Let it Grow, and made it through most the song before being cleared out.\n\nLater during the space, I saw my friend... he'd been readmitted & told his story to the head of security, who had issued a edict to allow dancing. So, we danced from the space on.. :^)",

      "review_text": "msa 81 This was my 3rd show in my Dead career which is still quite active I must say, and this night changed my life forever. Being from Indy, i always loved hometown shows. On this night i finally got it. Went with 3 freinds from the Pawn Brokers Pub in Indy and after it was over, they wanted to know why my jaw was still attatched to my sternum. I first off want to thank Steve, who supplied me with what he called \"pyramid LSD\" the night before at a party in Zionsville. He asked me if I was going to the show and advised me to take these with me. Thank you bro. Dan ,jim and Merideth were my escorts, even though I drove that night, I did not drive home after the show. I was still so stunned after that we got lost downtown driving up Pennsylvania avenue.  The Alabama /Promised land openers seemed like at the time like i was flying through clouds in a trajectory that was like 65 degrees . We finally leveled off in a land that at the time was unfamiliar to me, but safe and pleasant. The CC Rider was a fast ride and by the reaction of the crowd, which was confined to the lower portion of the arena and the floor this was a major surprise to everyone in attendance.Each song just kept getting better and better, yes even the El paso was great. You could feel the \"bullet go deep in my chest\". The first set left me in awe, as I did not say one word during the intermission, for I did not in any way want to disturb the place I was in. Bird song was simply amazing, I never wanted it to end, flying over mountains with tall pines with a full moon, wolves standing on cliffs as I flew over them, and then my first Let it grow. wow! After Bird song i didn't think it was possible to be any higher than I was. Boy was I wrong. I remember during Shakedown being in San Francisco(i thought) before we got to the sea for lost sailor which is a song i particularly like. Drifting, Brent providing subtle waves in the ocean, Jerry at the captains wheel steering the boat, and then land ,Sty. of Circumstance, mountains on the side of my movie that was playing for me, and I remember thinking, damn, the world must know how amazing this is. Not to mention the storm the guys created which i thought i got soaked by rain water, lol. During Playing in the Band, i thought I was riding this huge bird, fflying off into a horizon that I had never seen before, covering tremendous distance of ground so quickly, and then the Drums. I fell in love with  kettle drums that night, I went to a place like a huge demolished area, with all of earth's past and forgotten \"things\", broken wagon wheels, inventions never to be used again, replaced by a new and shiny earth full of color and life, and of course, the big wheel. studded with jewels, spinning at various speeds that took us out on the range and eventually landing on a new planet. It has been said there is no better version of \" The Wheel ever performed. I agree. I have not come across it yet and I have been doing this now since my 1st show in 1976. The buildup, well , there are no adjectives in the english language that can describe it. And the Playin' Reprise is my favorite. When it was over, we just sat there for god, 20 minutes or so just digesting what just happened. I had not said a word for about 4 hours, i looked at Merideth and said,\" you will be driving us home tonight, I can't drive\". I was virtually in shock over what i had just witnessed. I was also amazed that we had only been there for those hours, seemed like days, but the band provided everything, food, money, 5 or 6 differnt methods of transportation, and space to roam. 1 year later, i moved myself to Summit County, Colorado this night still very fresh in my mind in search of all those mountains, and tall trees, and I found them. I wanted more, alot more, and now, 32 years later, it is still the greatest night of my life, and i remember it like it was last night. God Bless all of us.",
