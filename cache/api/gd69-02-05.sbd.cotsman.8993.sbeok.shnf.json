The Dead opened for the Iron Butterfly, and the contrast between the two bands was something to behold. \u201cCaution\u201d as hot as I have ever heard, and the band performed the astonishing \u201cSeven\u201d  instrumental. \u201cAnd we bid you Goodnight\u201d, closing the show, was sublime. \n The Bear did the sound, and I quote him:\n \u201cI remember the KC show very well, we had to help the Butterfly's \n marginally competent roadies with setting up their gear.  The IB fans \n who filled the hall were in such a stare of shock after the opening \n set by GD that it was nearly halfway through their beloved \n Butterfly's set before they came round and starting jumping.\u201d\uf02a\n  The recording noted by the previous correspondent is apparently correct. At the close of \u201cGoodnight\u201d\n Garcia can be heard to say \u201cThe Iron Butterfly will be out in a minute.\u201d",

I'd agree with the note on the other one as something they are still warming up to as an improv vehicle. All the same, it still is nice and powerful. This show is all about the eleven>caution. The eleven here is one of the 10 best ever imo. At least top 15 if not top 10. When I hear someone saying the GD are pretty good but jerry didn't shred and peak, first I laugh, but I also understand how that opinion can exist. Of course we know different, chances are the person stating that as their opinion just hasn't been given the approriate versions of songs that highlight shredding jerry. Since the first time I heard this eleven it has become one of the song versions I give or play for people who say jerry couldn't shred like the big boys. Thus far it has not failed to change minds. It is just mother-f'ing SICK!!!\n\nSound: 7.5/10\nPlaying: 8.9/10\nShow: 8.5/10",

The Dead display what I can only describe as that \"peppery\" sound they had from 68 to 69 and they are spicy indeed. Unfortunately the sound is a little muffled for this recording so I kicked off a star, but don't let sound imperfections dissuade you from checking out this excellent show. The playing and energy are wonderful especially The Eleven which is in my opinion one of the best versions they ever played. Rolling thunder!",

I am always amazed when reviewers seem to obsess over small details of the sound quality as this little gem is now over 40 years old.

Not as famous as the Fillmore West run from later in the month, the recording isn't as polished, and the cuts are inconvenient, but these early February shows are just as enjoyable for fans of the era! The Grateful Dead had just turned the corner from the January Avalon Ballroom shows, and were still carrying a lot of the late '68 sound with them. We only have this single tape of 2/5/69, and it doesn't even crack an hour, but it's a very well-balanced soundboard. As proven by some of these comments, this is the kind of show that turned interested first-time attendees into lifelong fans. They nail all of the jam vehicles and staples with crackling jams and hearty vocals, and then in Caution, Pig is looking to stretch his cheeky rap a little further, but the band just collapses and melts away behind him, tipping the cauldron into a spaced out, formlessly multi-dimensional chamber of lysergic instrumental feedback... only to somehow find their footing again to step through it all and close the set with We Bid You Goodnight!",
