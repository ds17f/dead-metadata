Jerry was trying and it was a preety long show.  Regardless, people who like later years should listen to the So Many Roads, probabley one of the most unique versions played.  As the song came to the \"So Many Roads to ease my soul part,\" Jerry kept singing it over and over but never really hit that emotional point that the song often evokes.  Instead he switched up the structure and started to only sing \"ease my soul\" to a different melody.  I've never heard another version like it.  Regardless, this kind of rejuvinates things and as this \"ease my soul\" vocal part builds he starts into this really beautiful guitar part that morphs into a truly powerful (for any era) guitar solo.  This, solo for those who love the Dead, should be heard.",

You could feel Jerrys emotion and i was amazed at how long he kept the chorus going...it was \"easing my soul\" to say the least. I saw from highgate on down through the last RFK show. It was evident that Jerry was ill and not feeling well on this tour,but contrary to everyone putting down this whole tour there were definatly some highlights. These two shows at the Knick were hot, the band had a good energy to them and you could tell they were having fun. I think the fact that these were the only indoor shows of the summer had something to do with it. The sun wasnt beating down on Jerry and it was relatively cool. The second set was a classic dead set with a new tune tossed in there but i beleive you can put it side by side with any dead set from any era and it stands the test of time. The dead were refining their sound in late 94-95 and i think if they had more time to evolve this sound we would have heard some more realy great music, kind of like a nice old wine, they were getting better with age.",

This would create problems the first  night outside but things would be cool, but packed, inside.\nIn listening to  your  final show, so many  years ago now, you can take off the fuzzy glasses or simply put them  back on.\nThese two nights had some of the best moments of the final tour along with the  harsh realities of life on the road for Jerry.\nTouch starts off very promising, until Jerry takes  his  first solo, he is off key, but pulls it together but again Jerry struggles at the end.\nThey settle down and they hit the books with Walkin' and deliver a solid version. One of the run's highights is the next  three songs. Roses was a total surprise and is  played with that romantic poetic conviction that makes this  song so special.Iloved it! Masterpiece may be the  highlite of the set, Bobby at the  helm and  Jerry emotionally singing his harmonies, that was not always the  cases of these later version, they knock it out of the park.All of us errupt into joyous acknowlegement. The So Many Roads  is a unique version and is a must listen to, the ending  being very strong with Jerry's guitar solo clearly very emotional and raw with distortion.\nThe Music is  high  energy, but Jerry seems to have  volume issues in the end jam, but is played well.I liked the chord change they started doing in the final years with this jam as well.\n\nMy  buddy wanted to go into the  halls for the second  set, we had front  row  seats on Jerry's side so it was a tough to leave them. Anyways Albany has a  very cool dance scene on the floor level opposite the stage. If the usher were cool, which they were this night, they  would leave the long black curtins open so you could see the band and the sound was quite  good there. \nThe Help on the Way  starts off ok, but it is clear Jerry is struggling, it gets worse in  the Slipknot! that follows, this may  have been one of th wrose one i  ever saw, but starts  to come together right before Franklin's. Franklin's which at 18 minutes may be  one of the longest ones played. By the 3 minute  mark Jerry has turned it around and is starting to hit his  groove again. The song ends strongly and the audience being very appreciative and granted  Jerry some much need latitude.\nTo follow with Samba is good and  Jerry continues to get it going, it not the easist song  for him to play either.\nThe real gems of this  night start with a very  good Estimated, that  has Jerry in the front seat and his  volume cranked. It is  like night and day the band delivers an  excellent version and they play it out witha  nice slinky jam, arriving at a show stopping Terrapin.\nIt is  not perfect, Jerry misses his  cue for the first verse, but is an emotional one and it gets stronger and stronger as the  song unfolds. It is interesting that we all respond and emphathize with Jerry's plight and roar with support for  him this entire night at those  key personal verses. \n\nIt is actually the  bridge jam where Jerry really displays his mastery, painting a  soft and lilting unfolding of  emotions that is hearfelt and sincere. It is more reassuring than anything and when they arrive  at the Inspiration verse the  place explodes. Well done and Jerry ends it mightly. \nThere is a short  jam and the D/S is quite  good.We  went back down to our seats for the ending. The space into Watchtower is almost 20 minutes long and is again reassuring but hs some interesting parts as well as Bralove's contributions. This version played is passionate, Jerry starts off on the midi flute and  plays some nice runs but then goes raw and cranks up the distortion which end  up  creating a powerful version.Once again Bob really shines on this one. \n\nJerry noddles for a couple  moments, not  sure what  he may have been thinking, but then pulls out Black Peter and this  one is really  good. Jerry sings his  heart out and  delivers the  highlight of the night, tinged with that  humor and irony that always made this song a favorite. His playing is passionate and the harmonies sweet. It has a rollicking ending too.\nAround is played very well and they rock it out quite well too.\nIFTL was clearly for the tour heads who were roughed up the night before and maybe for ole Jer too.\nExcept for some distortion post  space this audience is quite nice.",

Franklin's ends up being 18 minutes long because the band idles through hundreds of bars waiting for Jerry to find his place.  My last shows were in '92, when I found the rot already too painful to watch.  Very sad.  Guess you had to be there.",

      "review_text": "The problem with Franklin's My buddy and I made our way to the far side of the stage so we were almost directly behind the band. They had lyrics scrolling on large teleprompters at their feet. We weren't sure if this was something new they were trying and we surmised that they added it because Jerry had recently had trouble remembering lyrics. The monitors looked just like audio monitors from the audience but they had computer screens. \n\nAs the band started in on Franklin's Jerry waited endlessly for the lyrics to start but they were not coming up. Eventually Jerry decided to start singing and he started with the wrong verse. Immediately the first verse loads in the teleprompter and Jerry got really flustered. \n\nI thought it was funny at the time but after he died I realized what I had seen was a symptom of his worsening health and state of mind.",

All of those songs being played for the final time merits this a significant show for me even if it wasn\u2019t maybe played the best, I\u2019m rate according to historical significance only. Even \u201cbad\u201d has its merits. ",

      "review_text": "Reviewing this show watching it on YouTube Typically of summer 95, there are really good musical gems here mixed with painful sloppiness and aimless or off-key noodling from Jerry, sometimes in the same song -- as is evident on Franklin's Tower.  Some songs are total stinkers -- Touch finds Jerry starting his solo on the wrong note and never really finding his place.  On Samba, he's so consistently not with the chords that Vince cuts him off.  \n\nOn the other hand, So Many Roads, not one of my favorites is delivered with power and presence, as is It Must've Been the Roses.  TMNS finds Jerry very active (as seen on video) but inaudible as Vince and Bob step all over him.  At one point he goes way up to a screaming high note just to be heard.  He must have had a talk with the guys between sets, because they settle down a bit in the second set, and Jerry delivers a creditable Help>Slip before moving into the aforementioned Franklin's.  Estimated is a solid if unspectacular rendition.  On Terrapin, the high point is at the lowest volume, as the band quiets way down for the enchanting bridge jam before the final crashing peak.  \n\nDrums>Space is a total snoozefest, unfortunately.  Watchtower at first does little to wake anyone up.  It takes Jerry well into the song, but he does eventually build up some steam.  That leads into the final and one of the best performances of Black Peter.  Around follows Peter as it so often did, and Vince carries the load here.  I Fought the Law is a nice easy song to end the show.\n\nThere's just enough good here not to give it 2 stars.  I'll go with a round-up to 3.  ",
