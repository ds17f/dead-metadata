      "review_text": "I was there Let me paint a picture of what went on.\n\nI was only twenty.\n\nSeneca College at the time was at the far north east corner of the civilized world. Beyond were farmer\u2019s fields. November in Toronto is bleak and cold. Snow is not unusual.\n\nThe Dead were not particularly popular in the Toronto area back then, for the simple reason that CHUM-FM the only \u2018rock\u2019 station on the dial, didn\u2019t play them. We (still) have rules about the amount of Canadian content played over the airwaves. For whatever reason the radio station, simply elected not to have the Grateful Dead on their playlist.\n\nThey did play in Toronto before, in 1970 on the famous Festival Express (I saw that too) (at 13!), so they had some familiarity with Canada and one would think, warm recollections.\n\nFor the Dead to show up in Toronto\u2026it was just weird. In \u201977 they had just released Terrapin Station. I remember the comment \u2013 Disco Dead. At least in Canada, they weren\u2019t at the height of their popularity at the time.\n\nWhat really ramped up the tension was that earlier that year, in April, Keith Richard was busted trying to bring heroin across the border. Canada\u2019s border suddenly was simply not worth the risk for partying rock musicians to cross, no matter how big the market was. The RCMP were hot on rock tours.\n\nBut yet, the Dead came.\n\nI had waited in line on an early Saturday morning at a record store in downtown Toronto earlier that summer. I was perhaps the twelfth or fifteen person in line at the only place selling tickets. Only serious Deadheads were in line. Some camped on the sidewalk for a while.\n\nI went with my girlfriend (now my wife). Strangely, she and her parents lived perhaps four or five blocks away from Seneca. We walked to the concert.\n\nIn spite of the cold, everyone was hauling back reefers between the parking lot and the entrance. Everyone!\n\nI was shocked to find that our seats were four rows or so from the back!\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. The room itself was basically just a big gym room with a raised stage at one end. There were maybe 1500 people in the sold out audience. Tops! Flimsy metal fold up chairs were laid out. There was tape on the floor indicating the row number. It was all so hokey.\n\nWe all sat patiently until the show started, high as kites.\n\nAs soon as it did, pandemonium broke out, all the chairs were tossed to the side and back and everyone just rushed forward. The \u2018security\u2019 just gave up.\n\nAnd for the next few hours we all just danced and sang and had a grand time.\n\nThe Dead, all to ourselves, in a small room. It was brilliant. It was basically a high school dance on steroids with the Grateful Dead as the band!\n\nUn-frikkin\u2019 believable.\n\nThis recording will attest, they played very well.\n\nAfter the show I ran into a childhood friend of mine. Willie if you\u2019re reading this, try to find me.\n\n(He and I saw Festival Express).",

I've always loved the music on DP 34, but the sound quality is so thin and squished (bad instrument separation, low bass, etc).

Wow.Just learned about this site and sure enough it was true.It's been almost 40 yrs and my recollections are fuzzy.We were students at the college,King City campus.Andy,your account helps put  some focus back into one of the best show I'd seen.It was my only Dead concert but that means squat.We started with some joints and drinks and then dropped some acid.I was high getting to the show but the acid wasn't kicking in.It wasn't until walking in the doors and then everything changed.It was like a glow came over the venue.We were close to the front,just off to the right.Everything blended together.So in focus and bright.One song ran into another.I remember the chairs now and the intermission.The show seemed to last forever but then was over before I knew it.Filing out the doors at the end of the show my acid trip seemed to end.The brightness and focus disappeared.It was like a dream.What a great memory to pop up after all these years.Wouldn't have happened without this site.Now I can listen and remember more from that night.Maybe not,but it will be entertaining.",

      "review_text": "Gymnasiums and amusement parks <br />Returning to Toronto after a seven year gap, to play at the city's smaller college's gym (and the next two visits were at an amusement park). Though they would play Hamilton several times (and, of course, nearby Buffalo), they only went to Montr\u00e9al once! The biographies cite the hassles of crossing the border. But early on they tried to develop a market here, playing Toronto for 8 shows in '67, one in '69 and starting the very brief Pop Festival whistle stop tour here in '70. And that's it for the eastern provinces. There was no Hallowe'en show this year. The 1st set is above average, like much of the tour. In the nearly-2hr Second Set the trannies are tight but there's a lot of Jer just hammering chords or single notes, and also a lot of drummer soup - which makes a show that's maybe a bit more unique but with less fireworks. A bit loose for '77, though some will like the dynamics. The Colgate show  was next.\n\nFirst Set. Sounds like the rest of the tour until it kicks wide for <i>Big River</i>. It's nice and bouncy, with hyper Billy/crazy Mickey. Check out the 2nd solo from Jer, back and forth between leading and rhythm figures. On the ace <i>Candyman</i>, however, listen to Bobby and Keith. I don't think the '77s get any better. It's the ensemble playing. The rest is average '77 (i e  good) but <i>Ramble</i> stands out for being peppy/bouncy and having a weird polka solo.\n\nSecond Set. '77 spills good <i>Samson</i>s liberally but check out Jer's ladder runs and the way he sets and resolves dissonance. <i>Ships</i> is average but <i>Good Lovin'</i> is a bit rough and <i>Sunrise</i> strangely sloppy. The way Jer is playing adds a certain uniqueness to some of the rest of the set, particularly working on <i>Scarlet</i> and <i>Truckin'</i>, though the jamming on the first is oddly neutral. <i>Stephen</i> has a nice, dynamic choogle and the solo is Ronson-like. <i>Truckin'</i> is a bit heavier than usual, and solid (Phil: \"on Bourbon Street and elsewhere\"). There's a lot of slop on <i>Around & Around</i> but I bet this one was fun in person. You can't beat an encore <i>Terrapin</i>; shaky but improves.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0 B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall =  3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nBig River - Billy and Mickey plaster the landscape\nCandyman - the '77s get no better\nSamson & Delilah -  Jer runs up and down ladders and resolves dissonance\n\nSOURCES: The samaritano_14743 sounds better than <b>DiP34</b> in places, but  has the tunings edited and no real advantage over the Chappell matrix (86233). It's astonishingly good (from a great AUD) and is pitched correctly. All but 4 tracks are on <b>Dave's 12</b>  (7 from 1st set and 3 from 2nd set) and <b>Dick's 34</b> (the other 3 from the 1st set and 4 more from the 2nd). Actually, for the trainspotters, the banter following Fire (Phil's joke: paging Sandoz & Dilaudid) is also clipped and added to Di34 (oddly, at the beginning of Estimated for 11/5).\n\nAndy-M - They weren't on the radio in the US either, in the 70s, except for a couple cities and usually late at night.",
