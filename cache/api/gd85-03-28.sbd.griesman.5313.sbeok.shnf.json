One of the most underpublicized extraordinary versions of this dynamic duo.  Seriously, I don't know what the first set holds, and can't wait to download it, but the entire second set is loaded with crisp, inspired jamming.  The LLR is lovely, and the jam out of it is amazing...from a whisper to a scream.  3 or 4 minutes of intense jammin' led by Brent.  Good stuff.  Drumz is above average, and the energy spills over into the post drumz segment.  \n\nI'm psyched to be able to download this under-publicized gem of a show.  \n\nCheck it out for yourself.\n\nPeace,\nSchwadust",

The transition into Fire on the Mountain is one of the best. Garcia\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s guitar tone is excellent. This recording brings Bobby\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s guitar to the front with an equal dose of Phil. The drums are a little low but it doesn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t affect the overall quality.

Was a real treat..I could say great things about individual songs but why bother, the whole night was a hoot..one of my top 5 shows the Scarlet/Fire was exceptionaly tremendous..crackling with energy! We were all very excited. The night before Phil sang solo for the first time in 5000 years!! He used Bobbys mike the first night and the second night (this show)he had his own mike set up.

      "review_text": "Great I'm not the type of person who goes around defending every 80s show and giving out five stars, but good God, this show is amazing.  This show is not only good for an 85 show, but is as about a good a show as the Dead ever played.  I've been listening to the whole thing all morning, and am now on \"Black Peter,\" just about to the end.\n\nA note on the first set: it would be worth your time to listen to the first set here: http://www.archive.org/details/gd85-03-28.sbd-set1.fink.357.sbeok.shnf\nOn this SBD, the mix in the first set is a little bit sketchy, and sounds much better in the link.  The link has the first set only, however, but the second set of this sound board sounds absolutely fine.\n\nNow, to the show:\n\nSet I:\nThe first set is played with lots of energy and is a lot of fun.  Truckin' and Smokestack are really good, and \"High Time\" is a rare choice for the time, and everyone is really into it.  Bob flubs the words on \"El Paso,\" but it's pretty easily overlooked.  \"Peggy-O\" is very tasteful, and \"Cassidy,\" in my opinion, is absolutely beautiful.    As other reviewers have noted, China-Rider is a monster.  It is sharply executed and has some great jamming.\n\nSet II:\nIn a word, amazing.  Set one is amazing, too, and you'd be missing a lot by skipping over it, but it pails in comparison to this fantastic second set.    \"Scarlet>fire\" really does rank up with the best of them.  The true highlight of the show, though, is what comes next.  \"Looks like Rain>jam>drums>space>gimme some lovin'>the other one>black peter\" must be heard to be believed.  Even the drums section soars.  Listen especially closely to \"the other one,\" because it's great.\n\nA note about Jerry's voice: Yeah, it's fucked up.  He sounds sick, and he is.  The touring, the drugs, and the complete lack of concern for his personal health has an obvious effect on him.  Luckily, however, the strain in this show ONLY affects his voice, but the energy in his playing is as high as ever.  In his defense, also, there are some songs that the raspy voice fits quite well, and adds some emotional resonance.  This is especially true in songs like \"Black Peter\" and \"I Know You Rider.\"  When he sings he wishes he was a headlight on a northbound train, you believe it.  Not to paint a dishonest, picture, however, it sounds pretty bad on songs like \"High Time\" and \"Peggy-O.\"\n\nStill, I think all of the talk about Jerry's voice on this show is a little bit misleading.  It does very little to diminish the overall quality of this show.  You need to listen to this show, multiple times.  It's awesome, and is def. in the top 5 for 85 - on my list, that is.",

      "review_text": "Great '85 show with amazing setlist! This is another great sounding show from '85 with an incredible setlist.  The band is on with lots of energy from start to finish.\n\nThe first set opens with a surprising Truckin'opener that explodes with exuberance.  Bobby sings with passion an the boys are hot.  The outro jam is excellent and segues into Smokestack featuring Matt Kelly on harp.  This version is bluesy and gritty and the harp adds another dimension that Bobby versions sometimes lack.  Again, Bob's vocals are great, delivering the blues with gusto.  Surprisingly this segues into another nice rarity, High Time.  The vocals are a bit rough but there is some decent harmonizing throughout.  This selection is a real treat and this opening trio has to be heard!  Bobby brings things back down to earth with El Paso.  Nothing out of the ordinary but it is played with enthusiasm and Jerry's leads are sparkling.  Jerry slows things down with Peggy-O.  This tune can sometimes be a mood killer but on this night it is another quality contribution to an amazing set.  High energy with brilliant soloing.  Cassidy gets a nice flushing out with some soaring soloing and group improv.  They close out this high powered set with a classic rendition of China>Rider.  The energy hasn't waned a bit and the jams are epic, especially in the transition and throughout Rider.  The vocals are good and Jerry growls out the headlight line. What an amazing ending to an incredible first set.  This version must be heard by all!\n\nThe second set continues the momentum with a stellar version of Scarlet>Fire.  It is very lengthy with some very impressive work by Garcia and interesting group interplay.  Bob slows things down a bit with Looks Like Rain but it is a passionate reading with great leads by Jerry.  Bobby uses an odd distorted effect which is kind of distracting and continues to do so throughout the rest of the evening.  The ending kind of fades into nothing before the segue into a psychedelic pre Drums jam.  This gos on for a few minutes and then the drummers take over.  The tarnsition form Space into Gimme Some Lovin is very awkward and the playing is sloppy throughout.  This song is always a blast but this version is subpar.  Out of it's ashes erupts a brief yet vicious Other One.  Jerry sounds as if he is going to rip into an ill solo but Bob cuts him off with the first verse.  After the first verse Jerry gets his way and tears into a powerful psychedelic solo that goes on for a few minutes.  The band follows suit and everyone is going nuts along with him.  Phil bombs aplenty!  They go into the second verse and segue into a soulful rendition of Black Peter.  Jerry's vocals are brutal but I find that effective for this particular tune.  After the run and see jam they segue into a high octane Sugar mags to close this epic show.\n\nHighly recommended!",

Don't think it was ever done before or after. 85 was a great year and all 3 of these shows standout among the 120 shows I've been to. SPAC and Hershey that summer are a couple of other gems worth checking out. Love, love, love the Truckin opener, then it goes into an awesome Smokestack. Have these on cassette somewhere now I've gotta burn em to CD. Just a great freaking time all  nights. My sister's first 3 Dead shows. How's that for an introduction to the Dead?? Like getting blasted into space in a rocket ship.",

And the Fall tour was also great. \n\nThis was the tour they were doing Playin' jams/themes sprinkled throughout. Also interesting setlists.\n\nAfter many relistens I do believe that East Coast crowd combined with the Boys being THERE, ENTIRELY, TOTALLY, make this the standout of the spring tour, which is saying alot.

      "review_text": "Loved this show Fortunate to have seen every show on this spring 85 tour. This killer show opened with Truckin>Smokestack>High Time!!!! Matt Kelly on smokestack was sweet. Close out one set with China>Rider and open the next with  Scarlet>Fire. Yes please may I have another. The recording is top notch. Kelly was getting pelted the next night by Mickeys drum sticks due to some altercation with Billy. 3/29/85. 14 shows total. ",
