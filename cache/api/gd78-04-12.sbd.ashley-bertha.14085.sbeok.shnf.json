They used a few different angles but as mentioned it is only b/w. Jerry doing windmills? Anyone who sees that laughs with glee. How many have seen Jerry playing drums? He ignored Mickey who was reaching over Jerry's shoulder to give him a hint that he'd like to play on his set. It has been mentioned how the stadium had lots of wood paneling but much of that was from renovations after '71, though it still sounds pretty warm. When they played Duke, it was usually the opening of spring tour on the east coast & there's some great energy from the crowd. Jerry was on fire this night & the band was synched up with him.",

      "review_text": "A great sounding and aggressive show Too bad that Jerry's vocals are missing from the first two songs because otherwise this is a fine show with excellent sound and playing. The fault is not Jerry's, you can hear him bleeding through on other mikes, rather the sound guys screwed up. You can hear them trying to fix the problem by the clicks as they try other patches on the soundboard, especially if you're wearing headphones. This is very disappointing because the band are amazing. There are some excellent versions of first-set songs that usually send me running for the skip button, but not at this show. Row Jimmy for example, which I usually find boring if not moribund. This is the best version I've ever heard of this song, complete with reggae-like breakdown in the middle and real dynamic and energetic playing. Jerry and Donna's voice blend perfectly, really beautiful. In fact the first set is stellar all the way through. Loser is wonderful! Things really get rolling around Lazy Lightning and from there on: bliss. 4 stars for the missing vocals, other than that this is a great show, one of the best of '78, damn those soundmen.  Jerry, Mickey and Bill are on fire! Worth the stream or if you have Audio Hijack, the recording of the stream.",

The band is engaged, Jerry turns some nice licks on guitar, everyone's vocals are good, and there are some great extended jams. (There are a lot of good first sets in the '72-'77, with declining frequency after that.) First-set highlights include Peggy-o, Row Jimmy (which has a different take on rhythm midway), and Loser. Lazy Lightning has a very tight jam. Bertha is tight and interesting, with the band shifting rhythms to good effect. (Bill and Micky get the credit here, much as they get they blame for some of the leaden Bertha's of 1977.)\n\nThe second set has great jams, but has weak spots. The vocals are off in places in Truckin', and Drums is too long for my taste. Wharf Rat fades out when things are getting hot. Overall, the show is about a 4.6.",

My expectations were proved\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6\n\nThe concert begins with a controversial \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Jack Straw\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. The intro is spectacular, then Bobby starts to sing the first verse and I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2t believe that it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s Donna accompanies him! Her singing is beautiful, maybe too beautiful to this song, I mean she and Bobby sing in slightly different keys. Two critical remarks: due to problems on soundboard Jer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s voice is barely hearable, and then at the end guys ardently began to climb the peak, making unusual fast and noisy (for JS) music\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Dire Wolf\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2m not against absence of vocals, but when voices importunately stand out somewhere in the back it really irritates. OK, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s not the first show with spoiled start due to soundboard problems, let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s move to the next track - \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2BIODTL\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. Nothing special, energetic singing of Bobby and Donna and finally I can hear Jerry\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s voice. Ah, I suspect he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s in a bad mood, his participation in song seems to be strange: only out-spirited repeat of chorus lines, which frightened me a bit.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Pretty Peggy-O\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 is great, but having listened to it I suddenly understood that Jerry\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s not in a good form (how I was mistaken!!!). His voice is tired, he sings without energy and at some moments I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2t decipher the lyrics, when Garcia turns to murmuring. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s the specific of the song, I guess\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6But music is nice. Then guys started \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Mama Tried\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 and Jerry seems to wake up, but not for long time, in \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Mexicali Blues\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 he again sings the chorus without fire, like it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s a boring duty for him. Again, can say anything bad about band\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s playing. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Row Jimmy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 is flawless, thanks God, Garcia not only plays it on high level but also sings fine. And what an ending! (from 7.58 to the very end), it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s the first time I hear such rhythmic insertion, and to my mind it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s in the right place here, it adds something new to the old and well-known composition.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2New Minglewood Blues\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 is the highlight of the first set, and then everything goes fantastically good. Wonderful \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Loser\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2, great \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Lightning > Supplication\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2, one of the best \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Good Lovin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. I also note the jamming in \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Estimated Prophet\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2, great job by Jerry. Perfect wah-wah, slow and melodic. Transition to \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Eyes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 is brilliant but unfortunately this version cannot be compared with jewels of 1977, intro jam is long and smooth but singing is far from ideal, Jerry decided to sing verses in a new way and it was mistake, also I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2t like faster \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Eyes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. Hm-m-m\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Drums\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 are way too long. Couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2t listen to it till the end\n\nThe end of the show is near and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s getting harder to comment the music. I would like to stop on \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Wharf Rat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. From all versions I ever heard I consider 72/09/28 the best. This one strikes near. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s not as mighty as former but the vocal is great. The difference between these two versions is in the ending solo before the last verse. Duke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s one is more dynamic, but it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s acceptable, and Jersey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s is slower and more touching. And finally a one word about encore. SUPERB. Fantastic way to end the concert.\n\nConclusion: the mix is great, all the instruments and vocals are balanced in the proper way (don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2t know whether Keith\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s playing in the first several songs is soft, or it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s recording issues), pair of splices deserve no attention. Concerning the band I should say the guys made a decent show. Yes, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s not a fantastic concert to die for, but even a strict reviewer should give it five stars\n\nPS: I relistened to \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2Peggy-O\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2s great\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2\u00a6 Definitely. I should have noticed it earlier",

      "review_text": "Lost In The Lights Bobby and Phil chastise the Duke Univ mgmt for keeping the houselights up during their first six songs at an early spring Wednesday eve at the In door Stadium. \"Turn off the Houselights, dummy,\" roars Phil. The crowd roars in return.\n\nWere the lights left up for the gendarmes to nab evil cannabis smokers? I don't know, but I do know one thing, The GD were aflame with the light of inspiration and seem to ignite just about every thing they touch with fiery performances ~ even on first set songs usually left unkindled.\n\nThough Jerry's vocals were missing from the house mix in the opening two it didn't stop the conflagration from erupting right from the get go. Jack, Dire, Beat it, Peggy, Mama, Mexicali, Row, Minglewood, Loser, Lazy>Supp all have their volcanic moments.\n\nIn the second set after a bristling Good Lovin Garcia is all over the place spilling out into the crowd and he gets a little jiggyy with it and a tad sloppy. But Roses is more \"up\" stuff even tho it starts slow. Betw Roses and Estimated there is stage to audience banter: Audience member: \"Tell the one about the traveling salesman.\" Someone on stage shouts, \"We're doing a show here\" twice and then Bobby comes on to explain the reference to the \"Traveling Salesman\" joke, but doesn't divulge the details. Then they blast mightily into a white hot Estimated>Eyes>Drumz>Truckin.\n\nThe transition between is broken by the shrill cries of a police whistle! Ha! Pranksters! (never trust a prankster) There's a sloppy beginning to Truckin that permeates throughout the song (sounds almost like they are laughing) and  bespeaks that the GD were kinda pissed that night and they took it out on the stadium ~ just looking for someone to throw down the stairs!\n\nThen they pull it back together with all dispatch.\n\nZoop! Wharf Rat is a cold drenching on a hot day and then the tape (?) fades out and comes back for Around. Strange fade out.\n\nWeir taunts the cops with his stuttering \"And when the Po-Po-Police knocked.\" I can just see Jerry windmilling the Wolf and leaping in the air and completely giving his all with tongue-in-cheek,\nupraised-middle finger. Get ye hence, Gene Simmons\n\nGarcia, Weir, taunting azure Duke Devils \"Run your life\" Us Blues. Waving THAT flag right in their faces. Waving the blue, waving the red, waving Phil doing the dummed-down \"Thank you and good night.\" ala Benny Hill saluting Hitler.\n\nIt sounds like they were ready and rested and hitting all the marks that night in Durham, and that ain't no bull. Exquisite Bertha remaster reveals the depth and glistering dazzlingness of a rally bonfire. I give this a 5 on performance and a 5 on sound. It wasn't the GD's fault. The cops were out in force, but the lights were blinding them.",

Believe what the other reviewers are saying.\n\nThis show is available for download, vault remastered, at GDLive. This was originally broadcast and recorded by the Duke U. campus FM station. During a modernization project a few years later, the original tape was discovered and sent to GDP.  According to the story, Phil insisted they clean it up and send it back. Now it's available for your listening pleasure.\n\nBe sure to check out the text files. The seeder details the show like a play-by-play announcer.  Prints out to about 20 pages, but quite a good read while enjoying the show.\n\n4 stars only because of the technical problems with the vocals in the first couple of songs.  Otherwise this show is a 5.",

      "review_text": "Good stuff for 78 The band rocks hard on Loser, Bertha, Good Lovin', Truckin', Wharf Rat, Around, and U.S. Blues.  My favorites are the jam songs, of course, and here, while they're certainly good, the almost complete absence of Keith leaves the sound rather empty.  Estimated is a perfect example.  Jerry's playing is superb, but once they start the outro jam, I can't hear any piano.  Maybe they turned him down so people wouldn't have to hear his repetitive, percussive, pedestrian playing as he was spiraling into his addiction (listen to him on Prelude from Europe 72 for a stark contrast).  Also, I'm sure I could find at least a dozen better Lazy Lightning > Supplications, for those who have posted how great this one was (and it is well performed, just not spectacular).  Check out 7/18/76 and 5/22/82 for starters.\n\nOverall, this is a good solid show.  I'll give it a generous four stars for the intensity on the simpler tunes and for the good sound.",
