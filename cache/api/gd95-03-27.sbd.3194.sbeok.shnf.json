Not as \"on\" as the previous night, but still enjoyable all the same. 16 min Sugaree is certainly something to talk about, as are Garcia's perculiar falsetto vocals towards the end of So Many Roads. Let It Grow is probably the highlight of the first set - Jerry displaying some nice guitar runs with only minor faulters.\n \nSecond set starts well with an upbeat Aiko but then starts to drift off, especially with the rather uninspired Uncle John's jam, which is about 15 minutes longer than it needs to be and doesn't really go any place good. A 14 minute Days Between is also a lot longer than would be ideal, mainly due to Garcia's dicey playing which one can't help but wince at. Sugar Magnolia and I Fought The Law however, bring the notch up again to close a good/average show with a bit of energy. \n\nSound-wise, this one on the whole sounds pretty good, though there are a few spots of digi-noise here and there.",

I had planned to attend\n10 shows in Fall 1995...of course, you know\nwhat happened.:-(\n\nFirst off, I clearly hear a cassette generation,\nparticularly in the song tunes.  So, the lineage\nis probably SBD > C > DAT > CDR > EAC > SHN,\nbut this is still a solid recording itself.\n\nThe show is interesting in spots, and the\nband is clearly trying for the most part.  As for\nJerry, the spirit is willing, but the flesh\nwas sometimes weak.  While Sugaree has been\nthe most talked-about song from this show, to\nthese ears, Jerry's best moment is the surprisingly strong Iko second set opener,\nbecause he is the most present in both\nvoice and guitar.  However, while the second\nset contains a few interesting jams, a good\nportion of them are too slow to develop, and\nyou hear Jerry playing three notes where\nthere used to be eight.  The version of\nPlayin' is quicksand-slow and pondering,\nbut Uncle John's is actually fairly solid\nvocally, albeit the jams are interesting, but\nalso slow and lumbering.\n\nSave for one very brief flub, Jerry gives a\nsoulful reading of Days Between; unfortunately,\nhis guitar tries to complement, but he hits\na few clams, along with a few rambling passages\nlacking in confidence.  \n\nThe rest of the show...like much of 1994-95\nGD, is very much hit-or-miss.",

      "review_text": "best sugaree of the nineties Yes this IS the BEST Sugaree of the nineties. And I HAVE listened to all of them. There actually isnt THAT many. I have over 1500 hours on tape and CD and this version is BY FAR the best, not just the longest. There ARE better vesrions. For example, any Sugaree from 77' or 9/6/80...but not from the nineties. And I'm not even a big fan of Sugaree. What people miss from this show, however, is that the real magic occurs in the second set with a 40 minute plus pairing of Playin > Uncle Johns (if you count the jam out of UJB). This is the best show of the Atlanta run, and in my opinion is in the top 3 of the Spring tour, and top 5 of the year. People bitch about the 5 song first set, yet it's all about quality people, NOT quantity. It features a 17+ minute version of Sugaree, a soulful, crooning So Many Roads, and a power house Let It Grow. Even though it's only 5 songs, it's still longer than half the first sets from 95. Definitely worth the download!",

It sounds like Garcia is trying to bathe a cat his vocals are so gone on So Many Roads and the Sugaree is a complete train wreck. The Sugaree is so long because Jerry was so lost. As the band seems to think the song is coming to an end (because of Jery's repetitive notes- and not a fast repitition!) Jerry awakes from his daze and sings another verse. The Aiko, while full of energy has Jerry all over the place, and completely out of sync (not in a good way) with his bandmates. We left this night thinking that the end was definitely near, and that Jerry was using again. Worth a downoad if you want to see the clearest example of them not being able to hit a home-run everynight. This being said, I would still rather see this show a million times over again than all the crap that is out there today. Also, on a bright note, the Sugar MAg is pretty fun and Let IT Grow is solid.",

      "review_text": "Sugaree at the Omni - A different point of view With all due respect (and I really do mean that) I completely disagree with those who have been tearing down the Sugaree in this show.  \n\nIt was interesting to hear this again after all these years because I was at this show and I have always remembered this Sugaree as something very special.  Since it has been awhile, I have wondered if other factors might have influenced my memory and colored it incorrectly, but after listening to this beautiful version I can honestly say that it is just as I remember it.  \n\nI was up above the stage on the side, looking down on the Boys during this show.  When Jerry was soloing I had my eyes closed and was rocking slowly back and forth in time with the beat. Mentally I was following Jerry\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s lyrical solos through every beautiful twist and turn. Jerry seemed to me to be right there; very present with the song and comfortable with taking the time he needed/wanted.  In the huge, cavernous Omni, filled with thousands of people, it seemed as though Jerry were all alone, standing on stage and completely at peace with what he was creating.  As he got into the later solo parts some very distinct imagery started to develop in my mind.  I saw Jerry in a fresh, new garden of tilled brown soil, sowing seeds that grew immediately from the ground into flowers.  The mellifluous (but somewhat mournful) sliding notes that Jerry played seemed to be like he was broadcasting seeds which quickly grew into rows of delicate red flowers.  \n\nThis version isn\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t studio perfect, but that\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s what makes it even more special.  Upon listening to this again, after 11 years, I can remember some of the more subtle levels of appreciation I had for the sensibilities of the Dead\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s music that I have somehow forgotten.  It is possible, as someone has suggested, that Jerry was lost or confused during this part of the song, but I wouldn\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t have believed it then and I don\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t believe it now.  \n\nThe \u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2false ending\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 may be labeled as such, but this seems to have a negative connotation to it - as though the chance to have ended the song at that time (as they could have easily done) was more important than the opportunity to keep playing.  Maybe Jerry was the only one who didn\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t want the song to end at that time, but what difference does that make?  He wanted to keep playing.  I believe that it\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s because he felt that what he was doing was worthwhile and had value.  And I agree.  \n\nI think this is important because it demonstrates that, even up to very near the end, the band, or at least Jerry, could put aside any formality of a basic song structure and take chances.  Placing personal musical direction ahead of expectations of audience members (or band members), and playing to suit himself was something that, in my mind, kept (and keeps) Jerry in the realm of true musicians.",

A  rippin Picasso and then just listen to the notes Jerry is playing right before Sugaree, like  plucking stars from the sky and then you get the best Sugaree since 11/17/83. The instensity of the tone of \"Bolt\" is great and  Jerry lays it all on the line. It is happening during the entire 1st set with a rockin AON and a majestic Let it Grow to boot. Aiko is one of the best of the '90's but folks  seem to ignore the huge Playing>UJB. The jam in Playing is like  5 minutes longer than usual and great.Uncle John's brings it all home.Days is awesome and  says much about Hunter's take on giving up and regret. The Sugar Mag is happening but the SSDD just cascades with that great energy we all love.Even the Law is fun. It is time to reconcile that the end was tough for Garcia and it was his time to pass on and for the 41 times, out of 150 since 1980, I saw him in 94-95. I just gave  thanks and  unconditional support along with the thousands of others singing and dancing  next to me.He knew that and a show was always the place we could leave who were were at the door and become part of something bigger than us,something that required or rather requested or didn't even ask at all, for us to give of and to ourselves and others.Remember we are the ones still here. Jerry gave that to all of us, he was our surrogate father for God's  sake and we couldn't change him but damn he helped change us.What will be his legacy be? It always be the music. The music that inspires, capitvates,and transformed many souls on this plane and yes drove us nuts some times too, but it is what it is and the music deserves to be heard.I for one would not have wanted it any other way. You just don't erase history because you are not happy. That was a big problem with the collaspe of the scene and we were all enablers to a certain degree.Some of us still are.",

To start with, it\u2019s taken me almost 15 years to come to terms with the 1990's version of The Grateful Dead, especially post Brent. But just yesterday I had a pretty profound realization. In searching for and listening to all of the So Many Roads available to stream on this wonderful site, I found that every crummy So Many Roads is a crummy show, and every good So Many Roads is a good show*. A 90's Jerry gauge, if you will! That was the 1990's Jerry. And when he was at his best in the late stages of his life, with his voice going, he really put his heart into those songs. Take my 5 best So Many Roads and tell me if I\u2019m wrong\u2026\n06.23.92\n03.11.93\n12.10.93\n10.01.94\n03.23.95\nAnd that was my realization. I was looking for the wrong thing in the post-Brent years. If you think i'm wrong, listen to the last show again. Seriously, but skip the rest of the stuff and only listen to the heart felt Jerry songs. Give it a shot... especially those of you that don't even listen to the 1990's shows. There are a select few that are quickly making it into my repertoire. So I'll give this show a 3, because a few years ago I wouldn't have even searched the 1990's show for something to stream.\n\n\n\n*Of course good show is a relative term, but for the 90\u2019s for sure.",

As for this one, it is the only one that I know of that Jerry actually starts crying during the 'ease my soul' refrain near the end.  It is nice to see some people hearing the message of the 90's dead, that is that jerry's voice and playing on the ballads are unmatched.  If you don't listen to the 90's, at least sometimes, all that tells me is that you buried your head in the sand for 5 years, or hid under a rock.  Yeah the crowd got bigger, and lamer, but not everyone who went was an idiot.  I treasure every show I saw in the 90's before we lost Jerry.  Now it is how I feel about pHil. You gotta see 'em while you can!  The rest of this show is awesome as well, including a huge sugaree, complete with the jerry fake out ending pre final verse...not to mention the playing>uncle>jam played excellently. And the Days between out of space is hauntingly beautiful. Get real.  Jerry wasn't the only one paryting on that stage, he is the one who died when he tried quitting.

      "review_text": "Lightning Bolt Lightning Round I\u2019ve listened to this twice in as many years, so I think I\u2019ve got a good enough picture of 3/27/95 to give it a fair review. The first listen was on 8/21/21, when the show served as copilot on the way down to see Dead & Company electrify Philadelphia. It was great background music for a drive through the Pocono Mountains and a spin around Broad Street! This week I did a second listen during my usual commute to work and a quick spin to see Santana at the Lakeview Amphitheater.\n\nThe first few songs tell an interesting story. Both Picasso Moon and Sugaree have initial slips and lyrical gaffs at first, then they catch fire when the boys really crack open each song\u2019s jamming potential. Bobby only got in 6 songs all night, but he showed some real leadership through his selection, placement, and performance of the tunes. Opening with Picasso Moon and following a colossal Sugaree up with It\u2019s All Over Now is a real fun zigzag, and the sequence is played quite well to boot. As a result the band and crowd alike are heavily engaged to kick off the show! So Many Roads and Let it Grow don\u2019t push the envelope quite as much. So Many Roads starts off nicely, but Jerry\u2019s voice gives out a bit and he just can\u2019t hit the notes he\u2019s looking for. It\u2019s almost as though Bobby picked up on Jerry\u2019s vocal trouble and decided to cap the set at 5 songs with a more jam-centric closer, Let it Grow. It\u2019s a very solid take with excellent pace, but it stays more tame and structured then some other versions you\u2019ll hear from the 90\u2019s.\n\nWhile the last two songs of the 1st set are somewhat brooding, the Dead strut into the 2nd set with an Iko Iko that\u2019s just plain fun! Jerry has Lightning Bolt flipping and twirling and sticking all kinds of delightful landings above some absolutely brilliant drumming from the boys at the kits. Way to Go Home just never does it for me. Then comes the meat and potatoes: Playin\u2019 > UJB > Drums > Space > Days Between > Sugar Magnolia. Some serious melty mayhem on display here folks, almost as if the final Dark Star that they\u2019d left behind in the Omni a year prior was trying to claw and leak its way through space and time back into the room. It\u2019s just incredible how Uncle John\u2019s Band submerges from a sing-songy chorus into murky, uncharted instrumental cosmic waters. Each of the songs from Playin\u2019 to Sugar Mag makes its own individual case as one of the top versions of the 90\u2019s, especially the psychedelic Playin\u2019 and a terrifying Days Between. Law is a skippy and lighthearted encore, and its brevity maintains the theme of the night. This is a 14-song lightning round that has a couple scuffs, but there\u2019s a healthy portion of the face-stealing X-Factor, which is most evident in the 18+ minute Sugaree and the delicious beef of the 2nd set! 4.4 / 5. Time to pack my bags for this weekend's Phil show in Bethel!\n",

      "review_text": "Honesty... I've never done this before, but I'm going to do this now. I'm just going to review the reviews. And I've read almost everyone here and I appreciate them so much. Honest and true looks at the Dead with some minor exceptions. There's so much going on in 95. The heroic struggle of Jerry against all his own odds, makes the music especially compelling and when they could get it right (like in February especially), when you hear the new sounds and tones they were making, you can hear they yet again evolved The Grateful De as f\nDsound into this high-tech synthesized midi fueled muscle that just sounded another worldly at times. I really REALLY love the best parts of 95 and I find it Wuh.,y more interesting than the slathered over boring late 70s stuff to be quite honest.\n\nI'm listening to the show right now and I can't wait for everything that was said about the second set. I actually was at one of these Omni nights but it wasn't this one. It was the last dead show I saw and it had some good stuff in it but it wasn't as good as the Hornsby night in Charlotte a week before which stands the last greatest dead show I saw. But there are lots of awesome moments and 95 shows and I see now there are lots of them here. But here's what bugs me. I get that people had their ass in their heads and bitched about going to shows and hated their new songs like if the shoe fits or samba in the rain or whatever,.... but here's the dead on the street about the Grateful Dead that apparently a lot of people still don't understand. When they went out on stage and whenever they played any song, they gave it their all and they were as true to their form as anything. You might not care that it wasn't your favorite song they played but they poured a lot of feeling into Lazy River Road or easy answers or whatever and hear people just toss that stuff off like it sucked and it's a waste of time and it's them at their worst just really makes me sad that so many so-called deadheads still have their head up their ass like the guy that spent all this weekend money to drive to a city and it's so pissy he didn't get Scarlet fire... it's clear some people haven't grown up or evolved since that hedonistic point that they found themselves first encountering the dead, and it's sad but clear listening to the dead never talk to them anything. They're the same people that bitch about dead and Company playing too slow. The music has to do something for them on a self-serving and ins\ntant gratification level and they are clearly not open to the type of mindset that Grateful Dead music was supposed to turn you on to. I don't even really feel like they're real Grateful Dead fans I don't care if they went 200 shows LOL they were just party assholes who happened to see a bunch of Dead shows if you ask me",
