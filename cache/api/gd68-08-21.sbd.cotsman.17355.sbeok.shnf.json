And I've tried different flavors of toast, too.  You know, white, wheat, the regular square shape and the longer rectangular.  And I have downloaded probably thousands of hours of this music and it will take me well into my late eighties to listen to it all.  But this show melted me.  I have listened to LOTS of Grateful Dead.  This one is why I have dreams of having been there in No. Cal.  But it wasn't to be.  What blows me away when I hear an almost perfect recording from this era, and this is one, is how so very damn good they were after only being together a few years.  Kinda like the Beatles.  That's one of the bands I have tried before these guys.  Great Cryptical > Other One sequence to ease your soul...  Phil rocks here too. miss you guys",

      "review_text": "Top 5! And a Happy Anniversary to this classic show. Well, this whole 4 show run from 8/21-8/24 is just unbeatable for 1968 fans. And trying to choose a favorite is like trying to decide which flavor of Ben and Jerry's you want. So good in fact, that both this show and 8/24 (Two from the Vault) are in my top 5. But take my advice - get the other nights now before GDL catches on.\nAlthough the first two tracks are cut short, perhaps from problems getting the master running at the show, the Other One finally blasts off with a fury. These were the days however, when one or both Crypticals were usually longer and better jammed than the \"meat of the sandwich\" - The Other One. and that's the case here. But both are hot!\nSchoolgirl is down and dirty, as it should be. I believe that's Tom C on organ, no offense to Pig, but it's a little more developed than Pig usually plays, plus he was singing. Listen and see what you think? Jerry proves he can hold his own with the Blues greats. His guitar is SO up in the mix, it sounds like he's plugged right into your speakers! And the final Alligator jam after Drums will just melt your cheese. Jerry soars above the charging rhythm section like a man possessed. And wait - what's that I hear? The Mountain Jam theme? Briefly, but yes. What a version this is!\nOkay, time for a break and pack the pipe. Cause here comes Dark Star. Fairly long for 1968 at over 13 minutes. And in my opinion, you'll have to fast forward to the Feb-March 1969 run also at the Fillmore (just released) to find a more perfectly played, true to the bone Dark Star. Garcia's playing just sparkles, every note is bent just right. St. Stephen is played like they mean it, with all the bells and whistles (literally) and Phil driving the train. But strap into your seat, they shift into higher gear with the Eleven - thunder, lightning and fireworks. The band is playing is SO together, they sound like a well-oiled machine. Even the vocals are good. The last few minutes are guaranteed to spin your brain into the cosmos. Wow is all I can say at this point.\nUnless it would be to add that the Death Don't is full of passion, soul and fury. Every bit as good as the one on Live Dead a year later. Don't forget that this was the summer that had seen the death of RFK, and the Chicago convention riots. And you can hear that pathos and feeling in every note here.\nSo sit yourself down, cut the lights. Burn some incense - or burn something else and get ready to trip back to 1968. This show will take you there!\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I'm really starting to focus on 1968-1969.  I've always favored the 70's (and don't take anything away from the 70s), but 1968-1969 is full of some of the best small band improvisation I've ever heard.  Although this show is less jazzy/improvisation than others from this great year, it is a fantastic show...with a lot of Pig.  \n\nSound is great...Jerry is in your face.",

It led me to believe that what I had was the complete set from one night, for the longest time until I saw/heard what is here.\n\n\nI guess someone took the first half of the second set of 8/21, and spliced it the second part of the second set of 8/22, to make one incredible show??????  Is it at all possible my recording IS just one show?  highly doubtful from what I now have come to see\n\nThis Dark Star>St. Stephen>Eleven is absolutely phenomenal.

This is the start of a great run of shows on 4 consecutive nights: 8/21, 8/22, 8/23, and 8/24 (Two from the vault \u2013 which is probably one show, from 8/24). These shows, similar in style and set list are one of the highlights of the year (another being February-March). The difference between these and the February-March shows is that the Dead had stared to shift from the Anthem of the Sun material and sound to that of the Live Dead album. The Anthem material, though still exciting and hot, isn\u2019t as good as that of earlier of the year. The Live Dead material is better than earlier in the year, approaching the peak in 1969.\n\nIn this 8/21/68 show, we\u2019re missing the beginning of Cryptical and Dark Star. Jerry\u2019s vocal is volume is low during the reprise of Cryptical, but the organ is well mic\u2019d throughout. It\u2019s a good Cryptical>Other One, but the end fizzles, not transitioning or really ending: it just devolves into tuning. Schoolgirl features tight playing, some nice guitar work, and top-notch vocal, harp, and organ by Pigpen.\n\nAlligator starts in kind of mellow (for 1968) bounce, but heats up after Drums, more like the psychedelic versions typical of 67-68, but with several turns in the road. In it, Jerry plays the Mountain Jam theme (common at the time). A few minutes near the end, Jerry plays the Goodnight theme, much as he would do at the end of Going Down the Road starting a few years later. You almost expect him to go into Not Fade Away (still a few years away), but they turn back into psychedelia and a short bit of feedback.\n\nNow comes the highlight of the show: the entire second set, which is basically the set list of Live Dead. At the time of this review, there\u2019s a two-month gap in 1968 shows at archive. During this two months Dark Start evolved. I\u2019ve listened to all of the Dark Stars her at Archive from the 12/67 3-minute studio version onward, and this is the first serious Dark Star, the start of the golden age of Dark Stars. This golden age ended in some time in 1970. The Dark Star of these August shows is far superior to the 1971 Dark Stars. These late \u201860\u2019s Dark Stars explore interesting places with musical jamming, not space, but with rhythm and structure. Here, Jerry and Phil intertwine in a psychic dance on top of the hypnotic organ and rhythm section. \n\nThis is also the earliest Dark Star>St. Stephen>Eleven sequence here at Archive.org (is it the first?), and the only one of this run of shows. (Earlier in the year, China Cat held the St. Stephen spot.) This sounds a like the Live Dead version of March 1969. Nice vocal harmonies in St. Steven.\n\nThis is also the earliest The Eleven here at Archive that includes the vocals. The Eleven jam is electric and driving. It makes an amazingly smooth, slow, imperceptible transition into a powerful Death Don\u2019t Have not Mercy with a great vocal by Jerry. Just fabulous stuff.\n\nJerry is on fire on Lovelight, and Pigpen does his usual stellar job. The end of Lovelight is cut off, unfortunately. Midnight Hour is average, not as good as the preceding set.\n\nAs of this writing, there are three versions of this 8/21 show here at Archive. They seem to all be from the same source. gd1968-08-21.sbd.unknown.1183.shnf_vbr has one problem: It also has the annoying feature of having Schoolgirl twice. The first track includes Schoolgirl. You hear again when you go to track 2.\n\ngd1968-08-21.sbd.cousinit.17689 may sound slightly flatter, slightly less high frequencies. For these reasons, I prefer this version here (cotsman).",

Only have a few specific memories left, but it spawned a lifetime of joyous Dead listening,to show for it.  Oh, the drumming/style/sound on this Fillmore show is like a portal to take me back to those seminal times. Sure wish a set list/tape existed of Aug 4th 1968.  Of course, Anthem was my 1st/favorite album, becuase it captured that summer '68 sound so well for me. What a treat to listen here again.  Phil is amazing even on my tiny li'l computer speakers.  Jerry w/ Les Paul tone, beaming, pigtails flying in the breeze.",

Maybe for folks going out of wi-fi range to do field work, downloading them is the only option. But aside from that, theses shows are simple to stream and listen to.",

A 14-second drum break is not a \"Drums\", it is a break that happens during the suite. To break up the That's It For The Other One suite into tracks at all is arguably OK, but messing up the stream on people's players with a needless pair of seconds-long tracks at the beginning is structurally intrusive.",

Great thing about the band among many things is some shows -- regardless of setlist -- just have that perfect flow. The GD were masters when it came to orchestration, tempo variety, ballad selection and all the elements of live performance. It worked better sometimes than others -- and the flow on this show is killer. Just put it on and let it weave its way through your head. ",
