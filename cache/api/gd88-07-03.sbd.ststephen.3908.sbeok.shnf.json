It was notable that an ultra-light plane was flying over the crowd rather low during Bird Song!!! The crowd loved it, but I am sure that it un-nerved the Dead and management. These tapes sound great...crystal clear with great bass extension...Sound better than my FOB tapes with the Neuman U89's...the bass was a little unruly for play back on even the most high end stereo's.",

The band was stressing over how to keep the scene going with the ever growing popularity.  Oxford was trashed by the events the week before because of the Monsters of Rock fans. The town was scared of the Grateful Dead coming to town. The word got around and we left nothing but footprints. Maine papers reported that it was a most enjoyable weekend for all people especially the towns people.  Oxford was truly the perfect weekend.\n\n~Dozin.com",

Funky. \"Tennessee\" is kept airy and loose. One day soon, \"Queen\" will be elegically beautiful...this is good progress. \"Bird\" features admirably intricate dynamic work... never commanding, but the varied layers create a lovely experience that rewards you with multiple listens.  \n\n2nd Set: \"Touch\" perks up the crowd's energy; it's swell but nothing memorable. Immediately afterwards, Bobby strums a line from LLR... stops, and the decision is made for \"Pocky\" instead; it sways something sweet. Now Bobby step forward and claim his mantle as head cheeseball (his braying reaches embarassing levels during the 8's and 9's) However, the music remains purposeful and full. The show's consistent in that there's plenty of cooks in the \"Estimated\" stew. Sometimes, they're not coalescing to make a harmonious sound, but the effort's being put forth. Brent's hammy synths are too predominant in the mix, leading to a lack of command in the performance. The outro is sufficently drawn leading into an (intro lacking) \"Eyes\" that succeeds best midway through where the liberation from a song's momentum leads to some sparkling Jerry lines (4:28) and some very pretty Brent efforts (4:44) (his treble is still too high for my liking -s sensitive ears) Frankly, Jerry could sound stronger, but it's satisfactory. The noodling stops after 8:13 and Brent sings his somberly reassuring lullabye \"Take You Home.\" \"Drums\" rumbles through Asian territory (4:20). \"Space\" maintains an even keel that leads into a good but not great \"GDTRFB.\" \"Miracle\" is appreciably over-the-top. \"Fantasy\" is rugged and seemingly invulnerable whereas the \"Hey Jude Reprise\" is given the full-blown stop and start treatment...Bobby's bleating is embarassing. The \"NFA\" is odd on this tape, maybe it was performed like this... just an immediate cut to 'I'm going to tell you how it's going to be..' without any intro. The voices sound strong, if the music is a tad forgettable. Full crowd participation goes on for five minutes past the 6:50 song time...\n\n3 1/4 stars...maybe I'm leery of all of the Dead I've recently consumed or this concert didn't gel as magnificently as the average '5 star' rating would assess.",

Great scene, great energy, great song choices, great playing.  The problem with everyone deciding that certain shows were the best of a particular tour is that they gather some sort of mythic reputation, when in fact, there isn't necessarily THAT much difference between these shows and the rest of the tour.  Which is just to say that summer 88 had a lot of really solid shows.  These two just happen to rise a little higher.  This recording is great, as well, although I'd love a SBD/AUD mix like the night before.  \n\nThe scene:  We avoided the huge parking lot and found a small camp-like spot in the woods with about 10 other vehicles.  I can still remember the smell of being in the woods during this beautiful summer day.  This show wrapped up the mid-west/east coast summer shows, which were fantastic.  And what a way to end it - these shows have them going out on top.  This was my first full tour and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  Next I was off to the west coast for my first Greek Theater shows.  \n\nThe music: Set I:  ok, rare is the day when I get excited over a Hell>Sugaree opener.  But I actually think these both sound as good as it gets.  Brent lights up Walking Blues with some fine work on the Hammond.  Jed doesn't rise to the level it's cabable of.  Queen Jane is actually really nice.  Usually it doesn't get my attention, but this is a nice version.  Bird Song goes waaaay out there.  Like most people, I was expecting one more song, but Bobby gives us the \"we'll be right back.\"  Inbetween sets I remember an absolute monster drum circle at the back of the speedway.  \n\nSet II:  Touch is well done - Phil's bass bounces around nicely.  Hey Pocky Way is sweet.  LLR is very good, but not over the top.  Estimated is really nice, with even Brent taking turns at the helm.  The vocal improv section is weak, however.  No ceativity, just single-pitch screaming.  The jam after is fluid and nice, but not spectacular.  Eyes is really strong.  Brent once again has a fantastic piano solo during Eyes.  He really brought his game to Maine.  Phil also steps up for the jam.  Everyone is pitching in and listening to each other - making for some really strong interplay.  I don't think Take You Home is best suited in the pre-drums slot, but I love the song nonetheless.  Coming out of space, things are a bit asleep.  About halfway through GDTRFB, things pick up and everyone starts pitching in to bring this up.  Absolutely fantastic Fantasy with Jerry, Brent, and Bobby all pitching in strongly (you can even hear a couple of great licks from Phil).  Hey Jude follows because the energy really couldn't have gone anywhere else.  Bobby and Brent trade incoherent joyous screams that may be technically deficient, but the energy is amazingly high.  Then it goes into a truly one-of-a-kind scream fest with James Brown-like musical stop-starts.  Not Fade has much more energy than normal, but we were expecting something else after - maybe another Blackbird (1st one was at Alpine) or a slow and soothing Jerry tune.  In any event, it was a great show.",

Does any-one else remember the beer vendors...\" kind beers for $1\"  everything was kind this & kind that..cigarette vendors\" icy cold kind cigarettes\"  The outdoor shows with general admission always got crazy.  Myself and pal would take bets on where the rush mob(gate crashers) would break through. At Oxford, I believe it was a tall fenced up gate.  One sacrificial lamb fell over first and got nabbed.  Next the flood mob pushed the fence down and the streams flooded through.  We watched it happen at all the outdoor shows.

Great show all around, especially the short & sweet 1st set.  \n\nQueen Jane certainly has some extremely beautiful moments.   \n\nBrent was obviously feeling good this night too.\n\nAnd Jerry seemed excited to sing Dear Mr. Fantasy for once.  Sounded great and energetic!",

      "review_text": "23rd Trip Around the Sun Show is a five-star 88 beauty. This trip features a short and really sweet first set that's followed by an excellent second set. Big Brent night, shining on Hey Pocky Way, I Will Take You Home, Dear Mr. Fantasy->Hey Jude Finale. This Oxford Take You Home showcases a rare lead-in to drums/space, as it was more commonly played on the other end. Only one of four times played like this (other times were 6/22/88- the song debut, 7/31/88, and 2/11/89). The Rhythm Devils waste no time getting it going. Yes, please!  \n\nOtherwise, dig the double dose of Bobby early on in the second set with the Looks Like Rain followed by Estimated. Garcia's second set Touch opener is spirited, as is the Eyes. Choice NFA encore is featured on the 30 trips definitive live story. Mmm-bop mmm-bop bop bop. ",

It was great to be in Maine ,General admission, band on fire..July 3erd, there was no Fourth of July show that year, and people were blowing off fireworks all night in the parking lot after the show, so there was very little sleep for me that night..I only have a sub-par cassette of this show so I am SO Grateful to have this on Archive !!",

      "review_text": "My first show and the best by far This event was magic.  The music, scene, and the town came together and everyone was kind.  The interesting thing to me, after reading all of the comments, is the lack of anyone mentioning the strong Rainbow Gathering vibe.  The parking lot scene felt like an extension of Main Circle.  Some mentioning the drumming, hang-glider, etc.  It was a Rainbow vibe all weekend long.  The National that year was in Texas, but I'd heard of a regional occurring close to Oxford to align with the shows.  I keep looking for verification but it feels like a myth.  Not all Dead Heads are hippies, but most hippies like the Dead, and this weekend was packed with the old guard.  Blessings to the 70-year-old biker that gifted me his private stock.  This day was absolute hippie heaven.  Anyone attend a regional that weekend?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering",

      "review_text": "The other Oxford <br />This show was talked about on tour as a throwback to the early eighties in old-school vibe and crowd size \u2013 away from the recent influx of gatecrashers and scenesters and bus-avoiding newbies. \"Were you at Maine?\" was asked for months later. The newly-reformed Little Feat (also known as a great live band) opened, for a protracted shindig. Bobby played his Modulus Pepto. The first set is short by a song but the second set is a song longer. It's not the best show of the tour, but it's top four.\n\nFirst Set. On opener <i>Hellina</i>, Bobby's guitar gets turned down on the OFF/SBD, so use the AUD (or at least MTX). <i>Sugaree</i> is solid,  but <i>Walkin' Blues</i> is where the show sharpens. Brent is great and you get good Jer slide. <i>Queen Jane</i> is an all-time superb version and <i>Bird Song</i> is chocolate cake for breakfast. The set is unusually solid overall.\n\nSecond Set. This set is the average '88, overall. On opener <i>Touch of Grey</i>, now Bobby's guitar is turned up and Jer's down (again, AUD or MTX). Bobby &amp; Phil tease Looks Like Rain, but it collapses and Brent starts a <i>Hey Pocky A-Way</i> that boots all brands of butt. Bobby then gets his <i>LLR. Estimated</i> is not the tightest and now Bobby can only shout, but Jer tries extra. Right off come the vox in <i>Eyes of the World</i>. Brent &amp; Phil are good, though it's a slight, understated version. This is the third <i>I Will Take You Home</i>, this time tried as a bonus on the way from Eyes to <i>Drums</i>. The latter sounds like the soundtrack to an '80s buddy cop movie. Vox come right off again in an uptempo <i>Goin' Down the Road</i>. Bobby is a bit rough again on <i>I Need a Miracle</i> and when he opts for slide practice at the end it's dumped fairly quickly by Jer. But Bobby adds a little difference to <i>Dear Mr. Fantasy</i> that makes it the peak of the back nine ... Until <i>Hey Jude</i>. Ouch! Guess you had to be there. They return right away for a hard-start <i>Not Fade Away</i>.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall = 3\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nQueen Jane Approximately \u2013 superb version\nBird Song \u2013 but the whole set is no slouch\nHey Pocky A-Way \u2013 peak Brent era\n\nSOURCES: The only SBD to date is a bit tinny and a bit fast (<u>needing -1% pitch correction</u>). There's a decent AUD (suraci_82801) and MTX (haugh_92585). There is also a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gd1988-07-03.mtx.haugh.98647.dvda/menu_images/track01.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">slide show</a>. <b>30 Trips</b> has the whole show in great fidelity. <b>Definitive Live</b> has Not Fade Away (w/the crowd chant edited).",
