      "review_text": "The Other One A very solid Deal to kick off the party. The Cassidy is great until the jam, which I feel is wrapped up far to short. Phil is really boomin, but they seemed to phone that one in. But damn, my disappointment is taken care of very quickly. Short lived, and probably best that way, these funked out Jack-a-Roes are just plain dirty. Bob really gets to add to the song played this way. The quicker form of the song is all jerry and the keys. Thump Thump Thump. I remember the first time I heard this, I was taken aback. How could they have played this song any other way than the bluegrassy way. Then I hit the repeat button. A nice thick mexicali comes next.  The FOTD is sublime. It is nothing short of breathtaking. Listen to the 6:15 moment. Jer just breaks down the meaning of life for ya and serves it with a smile. New Minglewood is a tune that imho, saw its best days in 1977. The style they were playing that year gelled just right with it. A nice rockin version here. The roses is so sweet. Definetely worth a single tear.  The Lazy Lightning>Supplication is out-and-out nastiness. So they start out cutting it short on me in an otherwise kickin Cassidy, but by this point they are hitting bulls eyes shootin from the hip. Eh to High Time, has been done much better. The way they just kick into TMNS gives you the go sign. They are in the groove now.\n\nSet II is surely anticipated to the uppermost degree. It should be noted that Jer's tone on the mu-tron is twanged just slightly less than most other 77 shows. His low notes are very full here. Save one misstep by Jer near the end this TMNS is a nominee for best version...not the best, but could get tossed around in debate.\n\nJack Straw is such a great tune, but knowing what a rocker it became a decade later ruined all the earlier versions for me. That said, this is a pretty good Jack Straw. Ship of Fools. Beautiful song, misplaced in the set 9 times out of 10. Don't like where it sits here. And then, due to the circumstances of today, in just my life, I find myself sitting at work fighting hard to hold back the tears, covered in goosebumps. Officially I stick by my placement critique, personally..well, today it really got to me. :)\nJerry's tone on this prophet is incredible. All out mutron assaults. Keith is playing pretty well on this as well. He really didn't add much to the earlier part of the show. Maybe Jer shook him to life with his thumping. There is a very nice transition to eyes here. The eyes is nice. \n\nBasically what I am getting at with this review is that while this is a very well played show, and is smooth and polished, the playing itself isn't all that interesting in comparison with each year prior. That's not to say there isn't some sick stuff going on but the fascination with 77 has come to mean, imho, easy listening dead. This eyes is the example I am using because I know there is an TOO coming up that this opinion doesn't apply to. This is very good eyes but nothing about it even steps on the playing field with pre-hiatus eyes. There is a lack of spontaneity in the music that didn't exist even in 76. Despite all that the boys really plug away at what they are doing they way they are doing it. What remains the greatest thing about listening back on all these recordings is that GD had so many completely distinct sounds and approaches over the years that there are infinite comparisons to be made. On the plus side Donna sounds a lot better on this eyes than on any of the versions pre-hiatus.\n\nThere is a cut coming out of eyes during drums. Then the aforementioned TOO. Man, this is just earth shatteringly powerful, but mellows just enough at the right moments to avoid the final meltdown. I can't say much more than that. It's pretty short but it packs a mugsy bogues style wallop. TOO floats effortlessly into Stella, and my oh my. Just achingly slow. Noone in rock or most other modern genres has come anywhere close to understanding the power of slow and quiet like Garcia. I love the re-entry notes from Garcia at the 8:48 mark. This Stella is possibly unmatched. The type of play in 77 lends itself to some of the already rather slow tunes and the way it works out here leaves me speechless. \n\nSound 10/10\nShow 7/10",

      "review_text": "Some great, some average In this amazing month of May '77, I think the dead are a little tired this night. The previous night is much better. Here, Deal and Jack Straw are flat, not the rockers they often are. Still, this is a very good show. Jerry is great on Estimated. Stella is stellar. Jerry's vocal phrasing here has a Willie Nelson-like quality to it, being slightly ahead of the beat. It works well, helping to convey emotion and meaning. \n\n1977 Dead features very tight playing and very good Jerry soloing, on-target vocals, and very high consistancy from night to night. And some excellent additions to the set list (Estimated Prophet) and the perfection of tunes like Samson. \n\nBut direwolf600 makes some good points. The Eyes from '73-'74 (before the break) are better than in '77. The Eyes from '77, including this show, lack group interaction of earlier years and don't seem to go anywhere. '77 also lacks some of the risk-taking in the long exploratory jams of previous years, and picked up again in later years. These explorations didn't aways work, but when they did, they were amazing works with shades of 20th century classic music, jazz fusion, and other genres. 1977 doesn't have much of that. The Other One here has some of that, but it's when Jerry plays a capella, and it's short. It works mostly as an intro to Stella Blue, the highlight of this show.",

I listened to the Charlie Miller Board, which is the best sound by far I think, nice balance, clear and rich bass.  This is a sick show actually.  The song selection is really the story here, since the quality of the sound and performance are pretty high across the board on this tour.  A list of the Jerry songs shows why:\n\nDeal\nJack-A-Roe\nFriend of the Devil\nIt Must have been the Roses\nHigh Time\nShip of Fools\nEyes of the World\nStella Blue\nBrokedown Palace\n\nIf you like Jerry's voice, and I love it, always thought he was a great rock singer, this show is a virtual smorgasbord of delight.  His pipes are in fine form here as well, and his vocal stylings just knock me out.  If that was not enough, these songs pretty much cover Jerry's prettiest melodies of his songwriting career, and they are all given nice long thorough treatment.  As tight as the rest of the band is on this tour.  This all adds up to a real treat.  This gets thrown around alot on this site, but this show is really probably overlooked a bit.  Guitar wise this show finds Jerry actually in rare form, literally.  Meaning I'm hearing riffing that is a little out of his usual parameters.  In fact, in the \"other one\" I thought I might be hearing Tony Iommi for a second (but only for a second).  Great jazzy, ripping, seat of the pants guitar playing throughout.  The bands use of dynamics (meaning going from loud to real quiet) is amazing here, especially during \"Stella\" and even more so during \"Around and Around\".  Only a really great band has this type of control as a unit.  Really impressive.  \"Stella Blue\" is perhaps the center piece here.  Jerry's vocals are completely off the beat (syncopated) which creates a wobbly effect.  This is the type of thing that really takes me to the cleaners about this band, they are always seeking out a way to get different.  But his guitar solo actually made me laugh out loud, the man is playing entire phrases out of key like he was Charlie Parker or somebody) totally and ridiculously cool.  With phenominal sound quality (I mean it, it sounds terrific) and this set list, you need shock therapy if you miss this one.  A fine concert.  5 stars.",

      "review_text": "40 Years Ago Today Can't get more special than that! Wait, yes it can--it's also my birthday! I'm only up to Ship of Fools but I can already rate this a 5 star show. Very fine recording, to boot. Happy Birthday to me! Listening to it now on The Dead Shows channel on my Roku, through my stereo. Don't know which recording it is (one of two that are listed as \"soundboards\") but it sounds great! I always like to come here, though, to read the reviews. They always add to my appreciation of the music, so keep 'em coming.\n\nI like that the previous review was exactly one year ago today. Something special about listening to shows on their anniversary/birthday!",
