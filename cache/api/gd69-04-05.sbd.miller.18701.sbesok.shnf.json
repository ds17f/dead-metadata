I'd put this in the top 10 of '69, although '69 is not my favorite year and I have not heard too much of it. The Star medley, not surprisingly, is the bright spot here. Phil seems to be all over this one. Also, the TOO > Eleven will rattle your walls and scare the neighbours.\n\nThe slight hiss present makes me think that this lineage may not be as pure as indicated.

This is probably my fav from 69.I can't believe no one else has mentioned Jerry's solo on Dark Star.So I will.\n  This is the most aggresive playing that I know of from the Captain.I mean this solo sounds down right pissed and firery as all hell.For fans of Jerry's soloing this is a must.Man,at the begining of his middle solo after the vocals you can hear him smacking the hell out of the body of his guitar to coax feedback out of it ala Hendrix, then that mutha just explodes.Of a million and one great DS solos this is the one for the ages.And the opener ain't too shabby either.A must for any guitar player.Proto-shred from one of the most misunderstood players of all time.\n  The rest of the show is damn near perfect, both in performance and recorded quality.\n However,the afformentioned odd segue from the 11 into Lovelight only to be picked up again in the 2nd set might not be as it seems.\n  This show has been retracked and that transition sounds alot like a crossfade to me.Although, the persons name attached to this show has posted only shows of the highest integrity.Even though he appears to have access to studio qulity tools he does'nt feel the need to put them where they don't belong like other so called \"REmastered\" versions that were never mastered to begin with.So I don't think this person would crossfade the wrong sections together but if that is really the performance as it occured it sure is weird.No worry, this is a show that would be hard to mess up.\n For other audio tweakers this is as good as it gets.I droped this baby in Pro Tools and 3 hrs latter with a liitle help from Waves came out with the best sounding Dead Show in my collection. Make this a priority download.\n  Highest reccomendations.",

      "review_text": "Top 5! Well folks, it's time the old Doctor finally got around to reviewing some 1969 shows, been lost in the 70's too long! And I can't think of a better show than this to start with. This show is the real deal in spades, a pristine example of where the Dead were at in 1969 when they were really ON.\n     There are 3 runs (sets of shows) that really stand out for me as the peaks for the year. The first is the run at the Fillmore from late Feb to early March. You gotta buy em - it's worth it!! Also the late April run at the Ark in Boston - all tremendous shows. And this here 3 night run at the Avalon Ballroom. All 3 nights are worth having. But this 4/5 show is my favorite.\n     The show starts in an almost acoustic mode with Dupree's, and then a beautiful Mnts.of the Moon that just shines like a gem, nice vocal from Garcia. \n***** smoke break *******\nOkay, I'm listening to this Dark Star right now, and I gotta tell ya folks, this one still amazes me after many listenings. Jerry's mastery and sheer scope of his sound - all the way from blazing Hendrix bursts of blues, to experimental overdrive, and down to quiet\nclassical-like noodling. At 17 minutes, you might find longer Dark Stars in 69, but none as crafted and precise. They don't waste a note, esp. Jerry.\n     And just look at this song list! They don't leave out anything, plus the not usual additions of Handle, China Cat and the It's a Sin Jam.\n     As good as Set One is, they come back and take things even higher in Set Two. Jerry takes an extended solo in Doin That Rag that's quite good. Then they fire up the locomotive on the Other One, and it's one fast ride all the way to Bid You Goodnight - with no stops!! Phil and the 2 drummers are like one creature with six arms - their counter rhythms are an amazing thing to behold. \n     Listen to this Eleven thru Feedback (not for the timid of mind) and see if you don't agree that Jerry's performance is as good as anything Hendrix or Clapton was doing in 1969. Such Tone, such Taste, such Thunder! The 8 minute Feedback is Third Stone From the Sun meets Dr. Strange. No, your stereo is NOT melting, they just play it like that! Pink Floyd WHO???\n     Well damn I've heard this show probably 20 times at least and it just blew me away again! What are you waiting for? Be kind to your mind and DL this show now! Recommended heartily and 5 stars.\nenjoy, \nDr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "Primal Child of mine, who doesn't love these old Dupree's? This isn't the strongest one out there; Jer's voice is quite as compelling as some others\u00a1Kit\u00a1\u00a6s still got that kick though. While his voice detracts from the Dupree's it's vulnerability lends itself just right to this Mountains. Watch out at the 3:40 mark, I don\u00a1\u00a6t know, but it sounds like someone is murdering a crow. You can hear the call for dark star even before Jer puts down the acoustic, something about the mood, and Phil. After the verse, Jerry, drops in heavy and thick reverberating the feeling of silence while screaming a top a mountain on the moon. Basically, he gets in with extra umph. Bob's playing has really only just started to develop any signature style, and it pops in noticeably in the first minute of the jam. Something very absent from 68 Dark Stars, and something ever present in the jams of the next 26 years.\n\nRight in at the 9 minute mark a nice shift takes place that leads them to their eventual route with a sweet little feelin groovy jam. Before that however, at the 11:00 mark it almost sounds like a DJ from 1997 hops on and scratches a few riffs, followed up by some very drippy, bear inspired play. They go far out, this must be what it would be like to walk the dark side of the moon with no fear of what happens next, as far as what music would make sense in your head at the time that is. Again at the 14:43 mark the feelin groovy theme is revisited as they drop into a heavy Dark Star riff. While the feelin groovy jam is never dropped into, here is an early example of how it did eventually flow freely in and out of Dark Star. This Dark Star is notable for the aggressive nature Jerry takes with his solo and the slight of hand he applies to trick you into thinking it's still going on and before you know it, they have down shifted into harmonious weirdness. Fantastic Star, short and excruciatingly precise. \n\nNowhere to go but St. Stephen from that, just perfect. These old shows make me feel like I can squeeze the air in front of me until it bursts. The ease with which the dead were able to go from chaos to tranquility was rarely displayed so vibrantly as the first St. Stephen\u00a1\u00a6s. You want to hear passion? On time, at seconds 13 then 14, the again covering 18-19 listen for Jerry make his announcement, or proclamation. We came to TRICK YOU AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Into Lovelight we go. Very good lovelight. Jerry real digs in as does Phil just after the 5 minute mark, and as soon as they get in mickey and bill. There is so much enthusiasm in this grateful dead. They do a great harmony backing pig here as well, its 1969 and they are mixing folk, pop country, acid rock, blues, jazz, and swing all into one progression, its really something when you try to pick apart 74 and before dead music. The level at which things were happening when they were on is astounding. Nice drop in for pig just after the 8 minute. Lovelight gets up to a wonderful frenzy. Not the greatest of the era by any stretch, but it has its own thing going on. Nice multiple mini pig raps, very aggressive play from Garcia and Lesh while the drummers flow in and out. I don\u00a1\u00a6t want to say not asserting themselves, b/c that implies weakness, but remove that implication. They are playing off each other in a way that didn't really happen after mickey left and returned.\n\n2:53 Hard to Handle, you can hear the scream from the audience. OOOOOOOOOWWWWWWU. Its that kind, even though it takes them 1:20 to get in time with each other. It actually seems like poor song choice here, everyone is ready to go go go go, and they played a song that requires a certain amount of discipline in order to make it effective and/or good. Just before the 5 minute mark Jerry seems to get it there, but it falls apart again. Really the only sub par song in the show.\n\nHeHe Bobs voice cracks around 1:18 of Cosmic Charlie. Hehe And then much worse about 1:50. Jer, may even poke some fun at him with a few of the notes he plays on slide just after. Who knows, but it sure sounds like it. They are still having issues during this Charlie, but there is some comedy in this due to the multiple voice cracks from young bobby.  This is the 12th performance of appx 547 China Cats, and its place in this show is the marker that puts them back on track. The first set was very powerful, and interesting. The start to set two really through them for a loop. Even though they weren't necessarily together, they never got so far away as there are little moments of brilliance that live in the mess of H2H and Cosmic Charlie. From China Cat on though, they are driving an Indy car at NASCAR speeds on an off-road course, but it feels like a smooth ride down main street, don't let the boxing traffic lights scare you, this man-eating cranberry is on it. Everyone's doin the rag. The Doin' That Rag is excellent, really, just a splendid version, and as I mentioned, things just get thicker as we move along. This cryptical manages the oh so hard, loudness while in its most quiet measures. A quick drums and then full on explosion. It takes an extra few seconds, the drummers fall out for a beat and Jer, well who knows, maybe his butt itched, but he had to take a note off. Weir should really be turned up here, he has some nice chops going, but they are barely audible. \n\nWords can't do this TOO justice, it is much like the Dark Star in that when you are finished you think you've just heard a 20+ minute long version and then realize it was under 10. So much is going on, so much music, 5 interlacing thoughts and strategies finding their way to the same end. This is possibly the best sub 10 minute TOO there is. I won\u00a1\u00a6t say more, hopefully that explains it. \n\nThey find their way back to another peak in Crytpical and Jer really tears into it. The Eleven gets off slow, but as the lyrics begin everything coalesces, Jer lays down a soft lick underneath the Bob and Phil part and then things go. Jerry's voice sounds great. It's not the greatest Eleven imo, very strong and the segue as well as the outtro were both excellent. It flows very well into It's A Sin, which is a very nice pure version. Then Jerry yells, \u00a1\u00a7What do ya\u00a1\u00a6ll want to hear that will last for 10 minutes?\nAlligator Pig has sounded great the whole night. Alligator is super, then drums, a very good drums, but right around the 4 minute mark something happens that makes it great, really great, but you\u00a1\u00a6ll have to listen. Then Feedback, great for the right mindset/time and place feedback. This AWBYGN is a little different than many others. Awesome ending.\n\nShow 8/10\nSound 6(7 for 69)\nOverall 8/10",

      "review_text": "nice show but not a blockbuster i like this show and listen to it more than just once in awhile.  great sound and great set list though I wouldn't point to any songs here as definitive versions.  \n\nI'm probably going to say something controversial here:  The Dark Star has fairly strong momentum but the extraordinary is missing.  I think Jerry fires off some nice leads and it shifts gears taking you on the journey that is Dark Star, but it doesn't make a straight person hallucinate - you know what I mean?  The Fillmore shows the prior month were so outstanding perhaps it suffers only in comparison, yet for me there are other epic Dark Stars from this time (notably the 2/22/69 effort) and this doesn't feel like one of them.  In fact in a few songs it feels like the band is dragging just a little.\n\nThis is only an average St Stephen and they abort The Eleven to go into a solid Lovelight (they come back later).  Hard To Handle is great to hear as a new introduction to the setlist.  Cosmic Charlie opens with a nice lilting intro, something I prefer over the Revolver-like jamming intros.  But the vocals sounds like they're playing at 30 RPM.\n\nThen they go into a great China Cat.  This is really a prime early version that gets me so pumped I have to wonder why I have so many early 69 set lists that don't include it.\n\nDoin' That Rag, a very underrated song in my opinion, is perfunctory here.   The Other One suite is played with some passion that perks you up.  The Eleven is played in a style where every component can really be heard and focused on.  Not an over the top version, but very compelling where you can really tune into the groove.  Then we get treated to a rarity with It's a Sin.  I happen to like this Feedback a lot.\n\nMore of a thoughtful show than a tour de force, there is something here for everyone to enjoy, and I probably come back to it mostly for a specific mood and the variety of the setlist.",

I read one review that said there were flame throwers in the audience. !!!! How psychedelic can you get? I love the changes in Dark Star how the guitar can seem like a gentle lullaby and then sound like some razor demon a few seconds later. Many of these songs have seen better performances. St. Stephen, Hard To Handle, Turn On Your Lovelight, are all sub par. I agree, it's weird they didn't put the Eleven after the William Tell bridge. That's really weird. But then again this is the most psychedelic show I've ever heard and it's all about the weirdness right? China Cat Sunflower is like nothing I've ever heard. Cosmic Charlie. I'm too much in love with the lyrics of this song that even a bad performance gets top rating in my book and they seem to be goofing around on this version. It sounds very much like the one on Aoxomoxoa. I love Cryptical through Sin, very nice. Doin' That Rag? Um...well, that song is... different. I don't really know what to say about this song. It's not my favorite but I've never really heard a bad performance. In a way it kind of reminds me of Row Jimmy. Alligator through Goodnight is incredible. I was walking through the forest in my hometown listening to Feedback on my iPOD and I felt like I was Alice leaving Wonderland. Despite some subpar performances I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's finally satisfied my psychedelic thirst.",

      "review_text": "By far the better of two recordings, this one really fully captures the tone of Garcia's acoustic guitar, and the sublime shift from acoustic to electric at the Mountains/Dark Star transition point. That point, by the way, is one of the finest artistic achievements the Dead ever hit--not just at this show, but the whole concept of Mountains/Dark Star, on every level from the lyrical to the tonal. This should have been as much an establishment as China/Rider, I think, but the Dead were still figuring out what kind of band they wanted to be at this point. The Dark Star is one of my favorites, and I'm pretty sure that parts of it were used on Live/Dead. Hard to Handle is still mainly just a way for Garcia to practice his slide technique, but Cosmic Charlie is becoming more defined. China doesn't really segue into Rag like it would into Rider, it just kinda pauses pregnantly before Rag starts. Yeah, all in all it's not the most tremendous show ever, falling off a bit later on, but great nonetheless.",

      "review_text": "The good the bad and the ugly Dupree's Diamond Blues is an excellent and fun acoustic opening number followed by an equally excellent Mountains Of The Moon that starts acoustic then becomes electric and morphs into Dark Star. Very nice! Love Light follows and is a spirited version.\n\nUnfortunately Hard To Handle is a sputtering trainwreck. It was only the second time they played it and it shows. For some reason Jerry decides to play slide and he's just awful in the way Bobby was awful in the 80s. Youch! (If you want to hear some HTHs that smoke check out 08/06/71 the AUD version and 08/14/71, there are a host of others but those are my favorite two) After HTH it's time for Cosmic Charlie which is taken WAY too slow with Jer continuing the slide, omfg. The vocals are not rewarding either. \n\nThe rest of the show is perhaps a bit sloppy but also energetic, creative and well worth listening to. The band makes up for HTH and Charlie with some spirited playing on China Cat. The Other One is especially tasty as is The Eleven. The Eleven fades down at the end to the slow blues of It's A Sin with Pig on harmonica, very nice. Then it's time for an all too brief Alligator which fades into drums and an all too long Feedback which fades into We Bid You Goodnight. \n\nConsidering the high quality of shows the Dead played in 69 both earlier and later during this excellent year, I can't give the show any more than 3 stars. It's all about the context. Dont let my nitpicky review stop you though, it's worth listening to at least once.",

Other than that, man Mountains of the Moon just oozes with magic, emotion, passion, energy, vibrations, etc.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's the same Mnts that's included in the most wonderful Garcia Discs. If you haven't before, definitely find those and give them a listen. It's a mix of the Dead, JGB, Legion of Mary, Reconstruction, and Jerry & Grisman. Real moving. Kind of a best of the best collection.\n\nThat's all. Stay Grateful friends.",

Jerry\u2019s vocals are extraordinary and the next night 4/6 possesses the best Death Don\u2019t and Baby Blue ever recorded. IMO.  It is absolutely breathtaking and may even make you cry.  It\u2019s a brand of Jerry that kept us all coming back. Once you hear these renditions you will want to play them over and over and share with your friends. I have the tape from 20 years ago and it is a sweet board (for a TDK that\u2019s i cant play anymore). I can\u2019t find the show on here though.  Happy hunting !",

They didn't have as many songs but they were FUN. Great stuff. Nothing NOTHING like a PIGPEN LOVELIGHT, BOIIIIIII. Take care.",
