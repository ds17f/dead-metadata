It was the night he turned 18, and now, he was \"responsible.\"\n\nThis was the Only GD show I ever attended with my best friend Paul. We were supposed to meet at Altamont where the Dead were scheduled to perform, but to move things along they deferred to the Bill Wyman hung-up Rolling Stones when he, on a shopping spree in downtown S.F., found himself without proverbial chopper and had to get to the concert thru a hard grind maelstrom of virtual Hail Mary's. Ah, but Nun The Less, he arrived and the Stones played, and prior to that eventuality, Jerry, Phil and the boys made the next chopper out -- Their coke already being pre-ground in anticipation of fuck up.\n\nAlas, a nice concert here muchly truncated, but, frankly...I don't recall how it actually came down except I think there were more songs done that night.\n\nSo this is my tribute to my best friend Paul. Born on this date 62 years ago.\n\nMay ye rest in peace all.",

The original liquid crystal display. Pulsing, even dripping from the walls during King Bee, that drum is just thumping into the consciousness. A quick run through Stealin' and the assurance that, \"everything's going to be alright\". Boy is it ever! Next up is Dancin' and a foreshadowing of things to come. Jamming out over 7 minutes, the night is lost forever, except for those heads in attendance.    \n\n\nHappy 50th Grateful Dead !",

      "review_text": "End of a 4-day run <br />The night before was an industry showcase for the Dead (and Jefferson Airplane and possibly another Bay band) and presumably the gear was still set up or otherwise available. Given that <i>King Bee</i> from this show is on <b>Birth of the Dead</b>, and with a matching set list, it's evident that the remaining songs not from the night before are also from this night (<i>Next Time You See Me, One Kind Favor, Friend of Mine, & Keep Rolling By</i>). The last one is probably the end of the First Set, the Second Set, since lost, occurring after sets by Airplane (they were known to switch back and forth during runs together). Usually what's listed is actually from the 16th. Isn't it amazing that we didn't know until nearly 50 years later? Or maybe not, given that we're still figuring shit out from the Roman Republic (albeit that's history of lesser importance). So, given what Charlie presents (with <i>In the Pines & Cardboard/Left Turn</i> now on the 16th), the known set list would be:\n\nBig Boss Man\nCold Rain & Snow\nIt's All Over Now Baby Blue\nCream Puff War\nKing Bee\nStealin'\nDancin' in the Streets\nNext Time You See Me\nOne Kind Favor\nFriend of Mine\nKeep Rolling By\n\n<i>Big Boss Man</i> is partial. Billy's drumming on <i>Cold Rain</i> is already great this early in the band - should have been on Birth. Weir is absent on <i>Cream Puff</i>. The big jam of the night is <i>King Bee</i> - blues from this band about to go full-blown psychedelic. <i>Dancin'</i> isn't the monster it would become a few years down the road. <i>One Kind Favor</i> is nice early Jer but it's for the best they didn't keep <i>Friend of Mine</i>. The end-of-set jam vehicle, <i>Keep Rolling By</i> is not the best they played it but\t\tworth hearing. This band would soon undergo radical change with the writing of Alligator, New Potato, Cryptical and Dark Star.\n\nOverall = C /  2 1/2 Stars\n\nHighlights:\nCold Rain & Snow - they had this one wired\n\nSOURCES: The miller21064 is best and part is on <b>Birth of the Dead</b>.",
