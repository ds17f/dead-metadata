Clocking in at 31:14, this jam is priceless early Dead. The improvisation at around the 12-14 minute mark is really dreamy and psychedelic and the Pig raps are very inspired. Though the sound quality on this song is rather hissy and degraded, it's certainly listenable and enjoyable. \n\nThe rest of the show is good '67, but it really sucks ass that Viola Lee is cut at both ends. It's a monster performance of this cut that most likely clocked in at nearly 30 minutes. Great jamming though, especially in Dancin, Schoolgirl, and an early Alligator (no segue into Caution yet).",

Not sure where to start I was wondering what to say in reviewing this show for starters listen to this (I am right at the peak of the sizzling VLB jam where they go back into the lyrics) and then listen to some of the stuff from the winterland shows late in '74 - 2 diff bands, or two diff drugs jerry was on.... I am guessing this is crank because Cold Rain just rips, dancin, and midnight hour are all really hot. Sound quality is 3.5 but the jams are 4.5. These are all really long and fun to listen to.\n\nThis show also drives home the indescribable and undefinable role that Pig played in the band and how irreplaceable he was. Had he lived the 1972+ years would have been far different musically for starters there is no harmonica and at least a dozen songs he did like lovelight and midnight hour were dropped altogether, let alone alligator, good morning, big boss man. We share the same birthday and have always been a huge Pig fan part of the band died when he did.",

I thought the only weak spot was Viola Lee Blues. It just doesn't seem to fit in well with the dreamy bluesy recording. Jerry is already in transcendant from with Dancing In The Streets and Midnight Hour. Good Morning Little Schoolgirl sounds more like a free form jam and not as tight as it would become in 68 and 69. The fade out at the end sounds like you're waking from a daydream on the Mississippi Delta. And the dreamy Alligator, the sole original here, is to die for. RIP, Pig Pen.",

You can almost see Dark Star jams in it. I think I hear a MLB jam in there too. Alligator is also awesome with high energy throughout and you can hear them itching to go into some other jam at the end and we see how this will become Caution. Midnight Hour goes without saying, just an awesome jam where they get lost in it and Pigpen is at his finest. A great show and I feel one of the best from '67. Crazy how in one year they've gone from short songs with an occasional freak out to this. I wish they would've done with Cream Puff War. Oh well, keep in mind you can find all these great shows for download at http://db.etree.org/LossLessLegs/Dead60s",

That's my ancient alien theory. But seriously, I can't find anything suggesting this was the setlist for the night... Only In The Midnight Hour because Phil mentions it... Which is debatable as to where it stands within this slew of disorganized early Dead... Probably the closer since Pigpen raps (paraphrased) \"just wanna tell you one more thing before I go\" and at the beginning of Dancin', Phil talks about starting it... So, you be the judge.\n\nAmazing Midnight Hour. I would kill for a chance to get up on stage and dance with Bobby! Viola Lee was high energy. Big Boss man... Awesome. And Elevator... I mean Alligator... Pigpen! I can almost hear Charlie Parker in there somewhere.",

They just recently played this show on gdradio and every song was played in this order with the exception of midnight hour belonging at the end of the set. Great to hear some 67, this show has the sound and exploration that seems to be growing and oozing into the unknown, it is incredible to listen to a show from about a year prior to this, and one a year later, you can hear how the development of their sound begins to take its shape in these years.",
