      "review_text": "The dog's bollocks of Grateful Dead shows This is the show that got me, and many many others, into the Dead. \n\nSo many of the songs on this setlist are my favourite ever live performances of them. Why? Because Jerry's riffs are perfectly chosen. The jamming is inspired. Everyone is playing in perfect harmony with each other. And the banter between tracks is entertaining, making you feel like you were there (what I wouldn't give to have been there....). I have never heard a better Me & My Uncle, Deal, Black Throated Wind, China Cat Sunflower, I Know You Rider, He's Gone, Jack Straw, Bird Song and Greatest Story Ever Told. That 11 of my favourite performances of those staple Dead songs in one single show, and I pretty close to including a few more... \n\nThe Dark Star performed on this show while not my favourite ever (that would have to go to Live/Dead), is my favourite excluding 1969. The jam is amazing, its so progressive... starting of really relazed and low key and building to a chaotic yet somehow ordered climax. You have surely heard how Dark Star can be like a steller journey, this version surely lives up to that. Its the story of dying star... a supernova. \n\nI have often wondered why this day stands out so much amoungst so many other excellent '72 shows. The video of this concert, Sunhine Daydream, offers a partial insight: A free outdoor concert on an absolutely schorching day, children playing everywhere, running up onto the stage in front of the band, everyone relaxing having fun eating icecream, dacin naked, and Jerry is playing his Fender Strat... that explains the lovely tone he's getting which complements the country & western style songs in the setlist so damn well. \n\nGet this show... its as simple as that. Put this on your best sound system, sit down or lie down, and do whatever you do to relax. Listen to the whole show straight through... let the Grateful Dead take you on a long strange trip.\n\nThis version is better than the other on this site, as it has the amusing stage announcement banter between tracks and remains 3 cds.",

I think I first got this tape in '89 or something, sounded like crap, but I could still tell it was awesome. This is the version to get with all of the talking. there are not many shows out there like this with all of the talking, it is special from start to finish. Ask any longtime deadhead which show he would like to have been at and this would be very high on the list. HOT!!",

Many folks' favorite versions of\nPlayin, Bird Song, Greatest Story, etc. When you listen to the Dark Star,picture that the sun was just setting, and the stars were appearing as the set began. This is post Europe, post Pigpen, and the band were stretching out their jazz fusion jams. The Dark Star and Playin, particularly foreshadow their 1973-74 sound. Get yourself a good stereo, a cozy chair and light up something stinky. A show that will never cease to amaze you!\nDr. Flashback ;-)",

All the pistons were firing, there is humour - Ken Kesey is hilarious, dogs are barking at the beginning of dark star, Donna crushes it and it is so sad to listen to her late in the game a derivative of this performance. Jerry's use of the wawa and the plaintive howls that produces. Dark star is arguably one of the best & there is no better version of playin and bertha is really really hot. Love the 1972 echo as well. This is the tape that goes to the grave with me. 6/5",

That sadly never took place due to Jerry's health problems, my dad still has tickets for it and said he was never more dissapointed.

      "review_text": "Sun drenched Love this show! I have to agree w/ the others it is one of the best. Sugaree was very well put together. Uncle and BTW were awesome. During China Cat, I went into this crazy tangent looking up the lyrics and potential meaning of the lyrics. I found a great site, http://arts.ucsc.edu/Gdead/AGDL/china.html by David Dodd. Re-read these lyrics and try to get into the mind that would write such poetry.\n \nLook for awhile at the China Cat Sunflower\nproud-walking jingle in the midnight sun\n\nCopper-dome Bodhi drip a silver kimono\nlike a crazy-quilt stargown through a dream night wind\n\nKrazy Kat peeking through a lace bandana\nlike a one-eyed Cheshire like a diamond-eye Jack\n\nA leaf of all colors plays a golden string fiddle\nto a double-e waterfall over my back\n\nComic book colors on a violin river crying Leonardo words from out a silk trombone\n\nI rang a silent bell beneath a shower of pearls\nin the eagle wing palace of the Queen Chinee\n\nBertha was great and the Playin\u2019 was topping out at 17 minutes and had me wondering if time had slowed down... it did. It was sheer rip in the space/time continuum. He's Gone was groovy. I always feel like I can taste the color blue when I hear it. I guess it was that time I thought they were singing it about me and was experiencing a little synersesia. Jack Straw, Excellent. Bird Song played beautifully. The stage banter is hysterical. What was in the drinking water!\nGreatest story was awesome. I sort of zoned out watching the visualization on my screen. In the history of man kind, there are few accomplishments worthy of greater accolade than that of the visualizer to watch while listening to the Dead. I'm forced to use Windows Media Player since my company blocks me from downloading Flash from the archive.org site but, even in its rudimentary options, the visualizer shows every string played, drum beat, note sang, and sound heard. Dark Star is also mystically cascading through the night. What a great night to be out under the stars watching the camp fire and listening to these great tunes. Thanks archive.org!  Plenty of plenty of between song banter! Dark Star is so jazzy (almost Dave Brubeckish) and integrated. I have to say it is one of my favorite versions too. You can hear the crowd whistling and cheering. Melodic, Connected, Simply beautiful. The transitive nightfall of diamonds was like a glistening shower in the darkness. Great Sugar Magnolia. Sing me back home was delightful. I didn't know that it was a Merle Haggard song, like Mama Tried. A nice line in that song is: Make my old memories come alive\nTake me away and turn back the years. Sugar Mags and Casey Jones were very nice, too.",

Woah, what a climax.\n\nI recall being very upset about the tragic death of a friend, and they were repeating \"He's gone.\".. He's gone like a steam locomotive and nothing's gonna bring him back. It struck a very emotional nerve.. and then, seemingly out of nowhere, the clouds lift, the sun shines and the angelic words of Nothing Left to do but SMILE SMILE SMILE. So true.

We had just moved to Eugene in July and bought our tickets at Springfield Creamery weeks before.  My wife rested comfortably in the Eugene hospital so in the afternoon I made my way out to concert.

It all depends on what you're looking for I suppose. I will say this is the best show post Pigpen in 1972, which of course makes it one of the best Grateful Dead shows of all time.\n\nOthers have pointed to  videos of this show on YouTube. Check them out! That the video hasn't been officially released is in my estimation, criminal. Perhaps not as bad as covering puppies with latex paint, but criminal none the less.",

The only problem with that is - with a real lightshow, the dead are actually there and you can watch them at the same time. Here, it's just a bunch of stupid crap when I'd much rather watch the dead play dark star. But the video of the dead for the most part was so cool and it does bring back those days when I'd see them in concert at the Avalon or the Fillmore. For that alone, I'm giving this five stars. A downer was seeing Keith and missing Pig's presence although he probably was too sick to attend but it wasnt' such a downer that it's anything less than five stars. Although even Mickey was absent for some reason.  Anybody know why?  Bobby still had his ponytail. Cool. They were all pretty much into it.  Peace.",

Had the good fortune of seeing it in theaters on Jerry's birthday, and today I finally got to listen to the entire concert on some high grade vinyl. Definitely a transitional phase for the Dead, you can hear some of that 69 magic psychedelia, some of that 70-72 rootsy space cowboy, and some of that 73 jazz. Donna is awesome and Bobby is really getting after it, while Jerry is tapping into another realm. Sing me Back home is beautiful, the footage of them playing it is really powerful as there was barely any lighting and the picture becomes very surreal as the band fades into the darkness. A five star show for sure.",

Tune in at the 19 minute mark and you will hear a musical improvisational journey like no other. Well maybe except the epilogue/prelude jam from Europe 72, aka 5/26/72.

Even some of those shows that are deemed \"too mellow\" by East Coast crew are absolutely relevant to me. \nOf course, I enjoy listening to East Coast shows, but if I could be transported back in time; Veneta would be one of my first stops. After that I would go to the Acid Test at the Fillmore, which is akin to this Veneta show. Veneta was like a family reunion. \n\nThen there is Winterland, Great American Music Hall, the Greek Theater, Frost Amphitheater, Henry J. Kaiser to consider, before I would even think about venues such as Barton Hall or even, I dare say, the Fillmore East or the Capitol theater.",

Europe honed them into a well oiled machine. That Playing is beyond. I get a contact high everytime I listen to it. Followed by the announcement that they're out of water. Perfect. The whole show plays out like a cosmic drama. And of course He's Gone right after. Because HE and everyone was gone after that Playing. Obviously one of the best shows the Dead ever played. The outside acoustics sends it out of the park. Theres something about outdoor acoustics that just can't be beat if recorded right. Every moment of this performance is exactly right. But you already knew that. No wonder people got naked.",
