The Spanish Jam is wonderful, maybe the best of the era, and the short Caution jam trucks along powerfully before fizzling out way too early.

Phil plays one of his parts of Clementine during the long Other One jam. I think it is about 15 or 20 minutes in. I think this is on other europe 72 performances also.",

      "review_text": "top 10! Another well traded 1968 that I had for years, but my copy was missing the short Dark Star at the end, so it's nice to have a more complete version. Why is this show so popular? For me, it's the inclusion of Born Cross Eyed, Caboose and Spanish Jam - songs which all appear on Anthem of the Sun, but strangely were dropped early in the year, and appear on too few bootlegs. In many ways, these 3 songs really capture the essence of the Haight Ashbury 68 Dead sound. Even more so than The Other One or Dark Star, which my ears connect more with 1969.\nThe sound quality, except for the usual analog hiss, is amazing for a show this old. Probably only a minute or so is missing from Clementine. And what a great version! Very nicely jammed, and also a song unfortunately dropped too soon. This semi-jazz style points the way to later Bird Songs and Playins in 1972 and 73.\nA long and energetic version of Cross Eyed follows, then they tear the roof off with a no holes barred sequence of Caboose into Spanish Jam that may be the best I've heard for 1968. Will just absolutely melt your face. Both Phil and Pig's organ are well mixed and add to the incredible sound montage. You can almost SEE Jerry's tubes just glowing like fire as he burns his way through Spanish Jam. What a sound!\nI think even after other 1968 shows become available, this one will always have to be regarded as one of the year's best. Oh, if it were only longer!!\nHighly recommended,\nDr, Flashback :-)",

Listen to Jerry's little bassy leads at the beginnining of the truncated Caution. Absolutly stunning especially after the squeal he let out on that Gibson a minute earlier at the end of Alhambra. Clementine is just sweet. The Drumming throughout the set is some of the finest by Micky and Billy in this era. TC (Dr F. How much of this organ is Pig? and I'm a Pig fanatic. If that is the late great Mr. McKernan on the B3 then nuff said....) is at his best and I'm not always a fan. I feel much of TC's playing,especially his fills,were dated and corny in a way the rest of the band was only sporadicaly. I much prefer Pig. Less learned more soul. Boy O!

In fact, the day I moved into town I met a nice group of people and went to see a Ziggy Marley show there, but that's another story. At one of the shows, L.O.S. perhaps, a buddy mentioned that the Dead had been there back in the day. I thought to myself: \"there's one I'd like to get.\" I just knew the recording had to be lost to time if it had ever existed. BIG smile when I saw this one here; and it sounds great. I'd like to hear the whole Dark Star. Yes the title of my review says it all: Day late and a dollar short. I just found this site about a month ago, missing the download era. I discovered the band late- \"Darkie\", I'd never heard their music before going to Irvine 87' Friday alone on a whim. Never looked back 100+.\nThanks for uploading this, to I.A. for having this site, to \"the boys\" for shows & so much more. And thanks to all of you for being the best people I ever met.

The true natural openness and experimentation is the best part- something the dead disappointedly lost later on going with MIDI and losing their country swing feel. Its great to hear any musicians really be into and loving their playing. I love the jazzy bluesy swing feel to the show particularly Clementine. Reminds me somewhat of Garcia with Legion of Mary. To bad it was lost later on. \nThis show definetly is worthy of my first review. I've only recently stumbled onto this site and its great. ive never heard too much of the Dead before 69 and the site gives me a great oppurtunity to experience the dead throughout the years. Before I mostly listened to 69-78 but now I know the music better before and after- something i probalby would not have done with later years (cds are expensive and im 18). but people my age is jsut another great reason why there should be free downloads. With so much other music, today and before, buying remastered cds of shows of the same band(although different each time)without the experience of being at a show is nonsense. Ive already helped them out way too much.",

      "review_text": "Rarities, first Clementine, first Spanish Jam, and a FABULOUS show This is a must-listen for fans of pre-1970 Dead. A fabulous gig played while they were still recording Anthem of the Sun. Every song is a highlight, and every member of the band contributes enormously to an audio feast with transitions as smooth as any in their history. Pigpen on keyboards is at his best. The audio is good, and you can hear every instrument.\n\nThis is the first Clementine. A real rarity, Deadbase records only 5 performances of the jazzy Clementine, which has the feel of John Coltrane\u2019s My Favorite Things. Sung by Jerry, Phil Lesh wrote it with Robert Hunter. Lesh has said that Coltrane was one of his main influences. \"The Coltrane Quartet and the long jams they would do in one chord was a defining factor for us...\" (from Phil Lesh: Operating Principles, JamBase.com).\nhttp://www.jambase.com/Articles/4909/PHIL-LESH-OPERATING-PRINCIPLES\n\nIn a seemingly effortless transition, the jam changes time from 3/4 to 4/4 and slips into New Potato, a core part of Anthem but a rarity, performed only 26 times. Pigpen is in top form on keyboards here. Jerry\u2019 delivers a spacious New Potato sound that is more deliberate than a lot of the 1967 performances.\n\nThis is only the second Born Cross Eyed, the first being 3 days earlier. It\u2019s also a rarity, with only 14 performances. And it didn\u2019t always follow New Potato, as it does on Anthem. The pair works well.\n\nAnd, this is the first Spanish Jam, which arises out of a psychedelic transition from Born Cross-Eyed. This Spanish Jam>Caution is featured at the end the first disc of Grayfolded (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayfolded , which every Dark Star fan should own). It is difficult to find a better Spanish Jam.\n\nSpanish Jam transitions into a short Caution (under 2 minutes worth), going into a repeated pre-Dark Star riff. The first disc of Grayfolded ends with this pre-DS riff.\n\nThere are four versions of this set here at Archive. The one with the longest fragment of Dark Star is at this link (though the audio quality is somewhat inferior to the others):\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd68-01-20.sbd.jools.19470.sbe-fixed.shnf\n\nFor a version with better audio quality, try this:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-01-20.sbd.clugston.5181.sbeok.shnf",

Tom ads a very cool layer and the willingness to slow down permits deeper thought and better playing/mingling between jerry phil and bob, the pause and feedback portion after the first verse allows for a great transition up, almost unexpected.  Spanish jam is cool too, but there are better span-jams in jan-february of 1970.  Sure do love jerry's vocals in 68-69 he is in complete control.  None the less these exploring jams are great.",

Simply gorgeous.\n\nThe Spanish jam i don't find nearly as good as 2/14/68, but it's still a smoldering version. Caution is just way too short, and the Dark Star goes nowhere.\n\nBut don't pass this one up, folks...not big on long jams but still oh so sweet...",

This show is so hot, it should seriously be illegal ! Like a top-shelf cognag, or champagne only opened for special occasions. I would put this on say, if I wanted to see telephone poles shoot stars backwards, or a kaliedoscope of roman candles against the night sky. Or of course if someone just simply wanted an idea of this sort of thing. \n We jump right in the pudding on this one, no slow opening, straight into that Clementine! Miles Davis? Coltrane? No, this is a full frontal lobe assault to the cosmic senses, a wynde and unraveling of the many facets and layers of sequences and synapses not unlike any other, yet totally unique in their complete and utter cohesion. The movement, that swing. Perfection ! \n Then, pure Potato beauty!!!! \"Last leaf fallen, bare earth where green was born\" :) Wow like church this Sunday morn ! Bobby even tells us about Madonna, and the voices of the storm. Slowly, they gently puncture a membrane that defies holding back that which can't be seen. In visions the sun oozes up, and through broken windows, we're now 'out of the bottle' ! Fluid, they are somewhere beyond the rings of Saturn at the start of BCE, when someone double-checking the reserve fuel in the tank lets out that scream. Then that by and bye . . . . .and how they slingshot into a Spanish Jam that may be to me personally, the finest moments I've ever heard the Dead put down on record anywhere. At times it's like peeling away the paint from the walls !   \n I see other reviews below feel it as well, that 'orange skies and cotton candy' organ, someone else even writing \"essential\" ! I mean the whole band is so tight, marching with such purpose ! A determined moment in time, clawing their way deeper into the greater conciousness through a way too short pause of Caution. Then a jaw-dropping snap back against, injustice? War? Fierce !!!!!  Seriously, turn that up and get down !! Passing an o too short astral belt on the keys nearing re-entry, we are trying to be pulled back past the stars early ! With one last wind-swept glance out the window, we finally fade out with a way too short but early Dark Star. \n Raw, with so much to say and do, yet still filled with wonder. In early '68 the possibilities were still endless. There was a digesting of everything that had happened the summer before, yet prior to MLK & RFK and furthermore, 1969 Manson, Altamont and beyond. \n\nMy absolute, all-time favorite 33:30 of Dead !  5*****  10,000 Thank you's !! \n\nI prefer this mix/version. Everyone is so up front in the sound ! A++ Thanx Julian 'JJ' Jools !!\n\n \"Think I'll come back here again, every now and then from time to time\".",
