This performance will live with me in my dead lore because it was my first west coast show and the boys always had a way  with playing nice shows on the west coast, close to home. Being from CT, I had my share of Pitt, Hartford, MSG etc...this evening in oakland is a very fine show, all around from the electricity the boys played with to the set list. \nEven the most fastidious sound quality guru will enjoy the raw dead experience this tape is able to muster. \nJack straw>chinacat to open set two is worth it alone but the rest of the show is just as hot as the list. \n\nAs I always say in reviews, it can'te a five unless I was there, well, had this been a sbd this would be a five, but its only a four.

If I was at this show I would've been a little worried that they expended to much energy on this show the night before New Years.  But, luckily, it was still just a warmup.  Don't overlook this show because it was eclipsed by the next night.  These versions are some of the best played during the late 80's.  Keep an ear out for the WHOLE second set and the 1st is no slouch either.  Due to the quality of the recording I have to give it 4 instead of 5 stars.",

If you (Mr. Downer of a few reviews ago) are one of those elitist morons who is still mad at Dylan for going electric, than perhaps you should've stopped listening to the Dead after Pigpen was phased out. Look, no one should be denying that Jerry's peaks got more and more deceptive through the '80s and '90s, but a true Deadhead - one who can think AND LISTEN critically - should reckognize that a great show in 1989 sounds different than a great show in the '70s.  After all, they were a different band, and if you can't change your aural perceptions to fit that understanding, than what use could your opinions serve? Sounds like you already knew you wouldn't like this show; preconceived notions  waste everyone's time. For the rest of us - the lowly appreciators of post-'70s Dead - 1989 brought about yet another Golden Age of live Dead, and this show is one of the many of this era to take us as far as we have always known the Dead can lead us. That is my opinion as a devoted yet critical listener of my beloved Grateful Dead.  The performance and sound quality of this show make it an asset to any audio collection.",

Recived tix for this night and new years eve show from a freind I met at a few Miami shows earlier in the year. Set him up with a crash pad for a few nights, couple of dinners and even saw a movie. Drove him up coast couple of hundred miles and exchange imfo thinkin not much of it. Calls me up in begining of December with good news of tix. Needless to say was WAY stoked on the trip. Wandering around the lot and found this old school bus and they were selling brownies out of old metal Grateful Dead lunch boxes. I love brownies, not just jucied up brownies but brownies in general. Bought 2 ate 1 and saved other for later. Found my seat and was checkin out this vollyball game on the floor (new to east coast fan) and decided to eat second brownie with a cold soda pop. Well the lights went down opened with Bertha and the show was on! These brownies were not what I was used to and I started to get very light headed. I don't remember much else till someone woke me up from being passed out under my seat. Sad and embaressed I picked my ass up and left, thinking to myself I screwed up my first west coast show. I recouped and made it to the new years show with no problems. I have seen people passed out at a Dead show before and never thought it was possible. Mabey they all ate some brownies.",

Had to speak up...who is the complete IDIOT that has inserted a 'one-star' review in each show of this New Year run - EACH SHOW / ONE STAR - complaining about the absence of the 28th?  What kind of moronic logic is that?  The lack of the 28th for download in no way affects the quality of the performance of any of the other shows, as if anyone else actually needed to be informed of this...  This is an excellent show in its own right, I think it is even better than the New Year's Eve show in some ways, and the sound quality is excellent too.  Bertha>Good Lovin' to open the first set (shades of '78), a fantastic West L.A., second set Jack Straw opener, great China>Rider, nice Terrapin and SOTM with a smooth Baby Blue encore.  Just because Dark Star (on the 31st) is played does not guarantee a superior show (especially in the 80s/90s).  I like this show a lot and if anyone wants a SBD of it, e-mail me at craigeyler@yahoo.com\nAnd keep your f***in' reviews focused!

Attn. all non Brent fans: Maybe you would rather have Vince. Cherish this shit.  \n     First of all, the music out of 1989 is good. Some of the best. This show is very solid to say the least. Jerry's voice is not shot; It's just aged like a really fine whiskey. Could you imagine him singing a \"Hey Little One\" in 1989, 1990,....etc.? Would have been awesome. I'd give anything to hear him sing a \"Days Between\" or a \"Terrapin Station\" again. (Have you seen Ratdog or Phil and Friends do it? It just don't live up. How about a JGB doing a \"Simple Twist Of Fate\" or a \"Lucky Ole' Sun\" in the '90's. It'll bring tears to your eyes.)\n     Know what I think? I have to agree with bigboypeete about Keith playing more of a tinkle and besides did you ever hear his ole' lady? She sounded like a dying buffallo.(Check out Red Rocks '78, the show with the \"Wharf Rat\" on it.) I seen Brent 10 days before he died in Buffallo with CSN and had the opportunity to go to Deer Creek and Tinley Park and wish I had. The left front tire came off of the microbus I was hitching in right before we hit Erie at around 75 mph. on I90 and I was so unnerved I headed back to Pgh. I didn't know which way the Dead was headed from there but they never did reach the heights of those last 2 years of Brent Mydland coming into his own. Don't like the Dead in '89 better check out Alpine Valley 7/19/89, Hampton Va. 10/9/89, and LA 2/11/89. Shows that will blow your ass away.\n     I also think you were misfortunate like poor old Grateful A/C and maybe you had 2 of those brownies too, but when you were asleep someone tinkled in your ear. Maybe it was Brent doing \"Walking Blues\"; oops, that was an \"organ\" too.\n     As far as jonesin goes, I don't know what to say dude. How about getting 12/28 the old fashioned way. Trade it, if you can find anyone to trade with your ungrateful attitude. I've heard over 1000 shows and have seen 54 of them. Some of the shows I've heard isn,t even on this site. I think you need help. Get over it. I give this show 4 stars for sound quality even though it's a five star show. I,m grateful for anything I get to hear of Jerry. Y'all have a good listen now, ya hear? By the way Happy New Year.",

Although this show does not feature the rarer songs that came to define the late 89-91 years, the playing is so inspired that it is a great show, truly high energy.  For instance, during Jack Straw, Jerry's main solo comes in such waves and out of the solo Jerry is absolutely screaming the vocals in unison with Bob.  Later, memories of shows like this made it harder and harder to feel the love for shows in 1994-1995, some of which were so uninspired that people stopped going as much--I believe it was one of the 1995 Mardi Gras shows that didn't even sell out, due to rain and Jerry's worsening condition; but I digress...get this show, truly sick jams throughout.",
