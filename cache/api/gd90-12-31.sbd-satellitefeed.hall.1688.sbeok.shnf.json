This show is highlighted by Branford Marsalis not only opening the show (w/Kevin Eubanks on guitar) but playing with the GD for the 2nd time.  The murmur in line was we were guaranteed another \"Dark Star\" like the year before...and were they right.  We even got a 2nd verse this year.  As good as this show was, for me it culminated the mourning period of Brent Mydland.  The GD played some legendary shows between Brent's death and this show (9/19-20/90, The European Tour) but even with the two keyboard players, the fire that Brent brought to the band was slowly disolving.  A more folksier sound was entering the music while the Blues edge that Brent brought was leaving.  For me, the band was never the same although I kept attending shows.  Download this and enjoy what was a great night of music.",

DL it before it disappears.  There are some stellar shows that have vanished lately.  No need to blast me, I fully support the boys in all of their commerical endeavors.  They have to feed the best, for sure. Now get this show!  \n\nThis show has some amazing moments.  Check out Jerry's counting off B-Song.  There's noddleing and then, bam, is Jerry's opening, as forceful as I've ever heard it.  Its not much to the uninitiated, but to y'all looking for a micro-trip, check it out.  There magic moments are legion in this show.  They were at the top of their 90's game here.\n\nI remember listening to an XL-2S90 of this that I taped off of WNEW the night after a debaucherous high school NYE party.  I wore it out.  After school, I would pop it in my Walkman, take a pack of smokes to the park and watch the polluted New Jersey sky fill with color as I drifted away, awash in the colors of the Grateful Dead.  I hope everyone has the opportunity to disappear in their own head the way that this show allows you to.\n\nEnjoy it.  And Thanks, again and again for those who make this possible.",

      "review_text": "Top Ten! I have an MP3 version of this from you-know-who. It's at 160K and the sound is quite amazing - even for an SHN freak like myself. Also, the Branford set and the Bruce Hornsby songs are worth getting.\nThere are New Year's shows, and then there are the ones when the Fates declare that magic and musical miracles shall occur. Tonight is such a show. I have to put this one on the same shelf as 12/31/72, 12/31/78 and 12/31/80. Rarely by 1990 do the Dead succeed in rocking this hard, and also explore the bounds of outer space in the same show. Combine the natural inspiration of NY Eve, with the presence of Branford, plus the pinch-hitter keyboards of Bruce Hornsby - and you've got a recipe for a masterpiece.\nI could talk about this show for days - but I'll only mention the highlights.\nJack-a-Roe - wow, energetic, almost bluegrass/Cumberland in the version here. Sweet.\nWang Dang Doodle - how much fun can they have with this one? Bobby is convincing, Hornsby is sparkling, Jerry is in his glory. If you're not dancing foolishly by now - you're brain dead.\nBird Song - 14 minutes long, and Branford sounds like he's been playing with them since 1969. Forget all the 1973 versions. This is Bird Song for the ages. The jamming is unique and wonderful.\nMaybe even better than the 3/29/90 one - also with Branford. Don't ask me to decide now, I'm too baked.\nSet Two does what the second set is meant to do, when the night is right and the muse is smiling - take you to another planet altogether. The playing is intensely expressive, and the interplay between the band is complex and innovative. They reach the ZONE, manage to stay there without overindulging or losing focus.\nNFA - is gospel-like and powerful. Jerry laying down testifying, scorching hot leads and Hornsby pounding the 88.\nEyes - after bringing down the house on 3/29/90 with Branford on sax, they had to do it again of course. Having the sax puts Jerry more in JGB mode - he doesn't have to solo all the time. He can relax and just have fun. Branford's playing here is pure sunshine, and when Jerry does take off, it's so tastefully woven into the texture you almost don't notice. Pure Jam Heaven.\nDark Star - hard to believe I'm comparing a 1990 Dark Star with 1972 or 73. But I am. At 11 minutes, this one is a study in miniature. But a real gem. They start the Other One theme halfway thru, then dissolve into free form, with Branford sailing above the fray.\nThe Other One hits like a thunderstorm and never lets up, complete with chimpmunk vocals and lightning leads from Garcia, and Phil and Hornsby keeping the pulse going. The Weight is icing on the cake!!! A stellar show and one to pull out on your NYE party.\ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

      "review_text": "gonna have to agree with lobster on this one Yeah, normally I also deduct a point when Jerry's voice is as bad as it is tonight. It does put a damper on some of the songs, but the boys make up for it in so many ways.\n\nMan, the more shows I hear with Branford, the more I think that he should have been a permanent member. He really breathed life into the band. Same could be said for Hornsby, who was permanent, but only for a year and a half. Both of them really fill out the band.\n\nAwesome Bird Song (agree with drflashback - which is better - this or 3/29/90? too close to tell), nice Dark Star, and the Weight is pulled off quite nicely. Energy level is through the roof all night! \n\n4.5 stars...rounded up to 5",

      "review_text": "The greatest show of the 90's This is one of those shows that made it all come together for me. I was on tour since the cal expo shows and got to witness alot of great music. Usually the third night of a New Year run was when the boys were clicking and that show was no exception. 12/31/90 was a magical one!! I always thought that Phils sound was more defined at an outdoor show. This show shattered my theory, so it has to be the mixing board. The first set was definatly a warmup for what was to come. Unlike the year before where they blew there wad with Bonny Rait in the first set, only to be let down in the second set. This one is all about the five song second set where they open up with NFA. Check when was the last time they did that! After playing Eyes from the Nassau show to death, I had a lot of expectations for my favorite song. At first I said, \"where is the Branford solo\".ranford made his presence completly different from that famous Nassau show. Hamza El Din durring the drums,with the talking drum really brought out the tribal in you. After getting through one of the best Other Ones ever, I said to myself, \"this show has been perfect. All that they can do now is Morning Dew, and it will be complete\". Warf Rat was when it all came together for me. That was Jerry saying, \"reflect the year but MOVE ON\"! My buddy Lobster is right when he said Jerry's voice was shot. But you can't take away the mood that was to be the greatest show I had ever been to.",

One of a trifecta of 1990 shows that had solid first sets followed by spectacular second sets featuring full-length Dark Stars, along with 3-29-90 and 7-12-90.  10-9-89 perhaps is in this category, but the Dark Star is not as good as the others.

Even with Jerry's blown vocals, everything about this night raves excessive cheers for a very enjoyable set, a great performance, an excellent recording and a touch of the audience as well.\n So, come on. Stop your ragging on the shows that don't play mostly 70's classics and seriously check out how talented the band had become from playing their asses off for so many shows over so many years. Everybody seems to be having a blast!\nGreat everything (*****)!",
