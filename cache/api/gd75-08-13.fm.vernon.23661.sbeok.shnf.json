The idea was to perform live to the world, for the first time, \"Blues for Allah\" in celebration of not only the completion of the album but also the beginning of Grateful Dead Records...This represents the beginning of the release of the vault tapes.\"",

Please understand, this is NOT your mother's Greatful Dead. This is NOT a loosy goosy show at the Frost circa 85. This is tight, well rehearsed Grateful Dead, and they absolutely deliver the knockout punch. As an amateur guitarist/pianist i think this show really shows what masterful musicians they were. That Help/Slip is a VERY complicated piece of music and not only do they nail it, but it sounds like theyre in the STUDIO! the fact that this is a LIVE performance makes it all the more amazing. Also, this show also shows how peaked they were in terms of CREATING music. I mean, no offense to the newer stuff, but i was AT the first Foolish Heart/Victim show, and it was like \"huh, yeah, this is pretty good stuff\" You can hear through the Board on this show that people at this show were ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY by the Help/Slip/Frank. This was the first fully complete version, with lyrics and people were in awe! This is how amazing of a band they were back then. That the \"new stuff\" was knocking people off thier seats! I would love to hear from a few people who were at this show and what thier impression was.\nWITH ALL THIS BEING SAID, lets get down to facts: Arguably the BEST Help/Slip/Frank they ever did (Downs of Santa Fe; 83?...Buffalo 77??) BUT what alot of people DONT talk about is the ROUND N' ROUND. I challange ANYONE to find a better version of this song. It is absolutely brilliant with Jerry and Keith playing there faces off. This version really shows what a great swing band they could be! Oh and by the way, the sound quality is top notch, and Kieth is playing flawlessly and is getting INCREDIBLE sound out of his keyboard (moog?) I love that 1 lingering note that he hits right as the end of Slip Knot starts to kick in (you know the one i mean!).....im out",

I had, like most aspiring deadheads, been buying every possible studio/officially released tape I could and then, it all switched over to CD.  I guess our forefathers also sighed when they switched from 8track or RealXReal. Well, I only bought the newly released stuff on CD... let's see there was that one with the clowns painted on it (hmmmm... without a net?) and then there was that tribute CD that had Dead songs performed by other musicians, with that killer intro of walking through the parking lot! Remember that?!\n\nSo, anyway, this was also one of the first CDs I bought. I remember being sort of confused. I have all these tapes (thank you tapers!) and now I'm going to pay more than the cost of a couple of blank Maxell XLsomethings and some of those hand drawn tape inserts that you pick up from some cool cat in the parking lot to buy a show that I already have? Well, I broke down and bought it and it was awesome! We used to hang out in my room in college and play it over and over and over.\n\nNow, as listen to this show again after more than ten years, I'm floored.\n\nJerry tickles your spine with his fast finger work on King Solomon's Marbles (or what I always thought was called Stronger than Dirt).\n\nEverything is so tight.

Phil reports this in his book and that Jerry was heavily troubled by this since Jerry brought Rakow into the fold to run Round Records.\n\nContrary to the lore that the Dead always blew the big ones (which does have some truth to it), they didn't blow this one. No, it was not a 300,000 person event or anything like that; just a small theater. But with the radio broadcast and the industry execs being invited, the band approached this as a major event for not only Round Records but their new music as well and prepared accordingly. The playing here is just so fine. It's not 73 or 74 anymore and that's OK. The changes in their style are obvious but they are still at the top of the game for a little while longer.",

There's not a whole lot I can add to what everyone has said. One reason this is so incredibly groovy is because of the tone of Bobby's guitar and Keith's fender Rhodes. Bobby has like the perfect mix of chorus, flange, and phaser effects and I hear phaser on Keith's piano. For you non musicians I am talking about effect pedals that alter an instruments sound. Here, it's adding kind of a swirling, swishy kind of sound. Very crispy and cosmic. The two of them together blend into a beautiful sound scape on every tune. Bobby is really such a great guitarist. Check out Keith on big river. The sound quality is superb. Everyone shines here. Sometimes I'll just focus on one member during the show and follow them on their magical journey, then the next time I'll follow someone else. As a musician I can tell you that very rarely you will have a gig where everything clicks beyond your wildest expectations and it's truly electrifying. Those are the moments you spend your life chasing. I bet the Dead came off stage this night and were fucking rivited by what they had just done.",

But Bill talking about how he wanted $12.50 for being there & dude wanted to \"flip for it\" which in my way of thinking he was trying to get out of giving him $12.50 & because of that he ended up giving him $50! Bill Graham always gives such an excellent introduction. I'm glad he got $50 for being there. In 1975 that $50 was close to getting $250-$300 in today's money. \n\n Well, tomorrow will be the 49th Anniversary of this show. In my personal opinion there are very few bands that ever approached having the collective talent of \"the Grateful Dead!\" Before I got to see my very first Dead concert I had probably seen close to a hundred other concerts. But AFTER I saw my first Dead show, I arrived at the conclusion that I enjoyed it so much that I would make every effort to see them play as often as possible. And if I had to travel to see certain shows then that is what I'll do. And if  possible then I would also try to see cool sights while traveling. Because of the Grateful Dead I got to see Niagara Falls after a show at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, NY. Got to see Miami Beach, Cocoa Beach & the Florida Keys as far south as Key Largo. I got to see the Grand Canyon & drive across the Golden Gate Bridge & the Bay Bridge less than 24 hours later.And drove all the way across the country & back. And countless other sites that were just local to where we were passing thru and or staying to see a show.  But anyway, HAPPY 49TH ANNIVERSARY \"One From The Vault\" I'm praying I'm still around when it hits 50!!! Lots of love to everyone & enjoy the show!!!\n\nIf there was ever a Dead Show that I could go back in time & see in person, this is probably the one I would choose. There are a few others that would make the list as I narrowed it down. But being ar this show, you know that when they did \"Blues for Allah\" at the end, there is no doubt that that one blew everyone there away. Anyone & everyone dosed was probably in a trance during the whole song cuz no one had ever really heard it & it's just so incredibly weird & trippy!  But the opening Help/Slip/Frank is Epic! And then 'The Music Never Stopped\" was perfect for after. And then kinda slowing things down with \"It Must Have Been The Roses\" before launching into one of the most beautiful \"Eyes of the World\"  The main highlights for me after all that was the \"Crazy Fingers\" & \"GDTRFB\"! I had already spoken of \"Blues for Allah\" so no point repeating myself.  Edited July 30,2021\nListening again on my birthday October 8, 2024  I just wanted to say how much I love this music. When Jerry died I had a daughter that had just been born. The last Dead show I got to see with Jerry was at RFK 95. All in all between '87 & '95 I got to see Jerry play right about 70\u00d7's. In 2002 I had a bad break up with my daughter's Mom..And in 2003 I met thr woman that would become my wife in 2007. She had 3 miscarries while we were together so I never was blessed with any more children. And I haven't seen my daughter since she was 9 years old. She turns 30 in about 3 weeks & I hope one day I will get to see her before I die. It's been almost 9 years ago that my wife passed away. While she was alive I knew my place was right beside her no mater what. I've never loved anyone as much as I loved her! And now with her gone & Jerry gone I feel more lost than I have ever felt. I still have a lot of love in my heart but no one to share it with. I turned 57 today & I have no idea how many more birthdays I will have.  About the only thing that keeps me going is being able to listen to some of these shows. I am really amazed by how great this music really is  & the fact that still so few know about how great Jerry really was as a guitarist/musician!!! ",

      "review_text": "The album showcase <br />There are probably no DeadHeads who have not heard this one. FM>C90s of the show were well-traded and there was a common vinyl boot. It used to confuse me when people talked about '75 being the \"hiatus year\", because I had this show and thought it must have been a big year! What most of us didn't know was that this was an invite-only, album release promotion. Rather than book with a promoter, they self-rented this tiny 400-seater in The Tenderloin district. Though termed a \"music hall\", it was a full-fledged jazz club, with a full bar, food menu and tables. The Dead were 8 years past booking Bay Area venues this small, and it was the only time they played it (though Garcia bands played here several times). There were label people invited, but the invitations zeroed-in on radio programmers in town for a Billboard convention [other invite-showcases that week were Glen Campbell and Waylon Jennings]. One reason for the event was that Grateful Dead Records wasn't staying afloat, because:\na)The Dead were on touring hiatus\nb)The GD Movie project was costing hundreds of thousands\nc)They had no distribution deal for the albums they had pressed\nSo conmanager Rakow sold it to United Artists Records on the promise that they would then distribute (and foreign-release) <b>Blues for Allah</b>, and get to release the movie soundtrack album. And they set up this industry showcase. With the movie stalled, the Dead delivered <b>Steal Your Face</b> to UAR, culled from the same run of '74 shows; but without a released film, it could not be marketed as a tie-in (and anyway Rakow took the advance and ran).\n\nThe show is known for those circumstances, its unique setlist, but also its quality. They played the complete new album, with 8 \"oldies\" sprinkled in, to keep attention. This was the only time they intentionally played a current album live (they played an industry showcase in '66, there were shows in '68 where they more or less played <b>Anthem of the Sun</b>, and one in 5/70 where they managed to present all of <b>Workingman's</b>). The show is short, at just over 2hrs. Both sets have a drum solo, and Mickey is sitting in - not yet fully returned to the band.   It's also known for Mickey bringing a box of crickets and miking them (heard best on the CD encore).  Phil said in his book:\n\"The rehearsals for the release party were more fun that we\u2019d had any right to expect. We tried to integrate Mickey\u2019s crickets into the performance of \u201cUnusual Occurrences,\u201d but they escaped from their sand-filled box through the microphone hole. Healy, at Mickey\u2019s insistence, kept running the cricket track louder and louder  as the crickets became fewer and fewer. To the best of my knowledge, they can still be heard chirping nightly from the highest rafters of the Great American Music Hall.\"\nBilly put it more poetically in his book:\n\"The crickets joined the revolution and staged a jailbreak. They liberated themselves...and made the Great American Music Hall their home. They were granted asylum. It was a very bright, clear, expressive night for the whole band. It was also just a really big moment for me, personally. It was the first time that I thought we could be a band again. And the first time I thought having two drummers again could work. The live run-through of the album should\u2019ve been the album itself. Sixteen years later we came around to that idea\u2014we released <b>One From the Vault</b>. I have such a clear memory of that entire night...a very pivotal gig and a great night of my life, overall.\" He then relates a story of driving home and doing 120mph in his Alfa Romeo on the bridge crossing The Golden Gate.\n\nThis was the only show in '75 that they promoted as Grateful Dead. At the 9/28 surprise show Kantner introduced them as Grateful Dead, but the 3/23 & 6/17 shows were billed as Jerry Garcia & Friends. The FM broadcast became a  vinyl bootleg, titled either \"Make Believe Ballroom\" or \"Hot as Hell\" (and subtitled \"The 1975 Spotcheck\" ??). Tapes in circ often came from this needle drop, missing 45mins via edits and 3 truant tracks. It then became the first officially released full show (landmark!). It has the correct pitch, the show is intact [less the tunings and edited intro] and in order. The album cover claims this was the first time the Blues for Allah songs were played, but that's not really true (pictures on the <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/The-Grateful-Dead-One-From-The-Vault/release/3613153/image/SW1hZ2U6Nzk3MTc4Nw==\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\">album</a> curiously show a mask of Kissinger onstage). The show works so well because they rehearsed it. That's not Dead SOP, but the woodshedding shows throughout.\n\nFirst Set. The official release is a mix-down, with a different image (Jer centered), so I switch channels for accuracy. This is the second-ever <i>Help on the Way</i>, and it's amazing. Likewise, the second <i>Slipknot!</i> (still short), and <i>Franklin's</i> (paragon). <i>Music Never Stopped</i> is the first one, and has the rehearsed vocal [check 3:30>3:45]. <i>Musta Been Roses</i> suffices. <i>Eyes</i> is the only one between 10/24/74 & 6/9/76. It takes off and keeps taking off. Can you even stand it? <i>King Solomon's Marbles</i> is the classic version. This used to appear incorrectly on tapes/lists as \"Stronger Than Dirt\" (actually the correct notation would be KSM>Stronger than Dirt>KSM). Bootlegs called this \"Milking the Roses\". King Solomon's was written by Phil, except the section with the start/stop riff (starting @2:35). This part was called Milkin' the Turkey, to give writing credit to Hart/Kreutzmann. The riff reminded them of the Stronger Than Dirt riff in the Ajax commercial [and at the end of Touch Me], hence \"StD or MtT\". There was an earlier version of KSM on 3/23, with a different structure, then one on 6/17. The fullest version is the final one, 9/28. That one and this one are the only two with a Stronger/Turkey [there is a Playin' jam on 7/16/76 that resembles KSM, but not quite]. \n\nSecond Set. The official unnecessarily moves the break announcement after <i>Around & Around</i> (which is on the mellower side yet still punchy). After a solid <i>Sugaree</i> is an incredible <i>Big River</i>. This is the version that made me realize it's not only one of their best covers, but best songs. The 2nd solo is one of Jer's top performances. When I built my first DAW, this was the 1st song I analyzed. Jer didn't play exactly like this in '74 or '76, so we only have a few representative tracks. <i>Crazy Fingers</i> is the second-ever, and one of the few from the new album that will stick in '76 (along with \tHelp>Slip>Franks & MNS). It was next played in Jun '76, but this is the type locality. Check Bobby's cool lines. <i>The Other One</i> doesn't resolve before they launch <i>Sage & Spirit</i>, playing like a TOO sandwich missing the other slice (\u2153 is \"quiet\"). Sage is the first of only two times Bobby's instrumental was played. The second, shorter one, during 3SF80 (10/31), was under similarly unique circumstances. But this is the only electric one -  the album version they had just recorded is acoustic guitar & flute; '80 is acoustic [with the flute line played by Jer]. So it's singular, and in a rarity for Jer, he uses a volume pedal. The beginning of <i>Goin' Down the Road</i> is clipped on all but the official. Happy band = happy GDtrFB, in unusual position as set-ender. <i>Blues for Allah</i> is the 3rd and final one, but the only one sung. It's the second to incorporate <i>Sand Castles>Unusual Occurrences (\"Under Eternity\")</i>, and completes the performance of Side 2 of the upcoming album (both beginning and end are clipped on SBDs). Sand Castles begins @~4mins and Unusual Occurrences @~15mins. What a bizarre and wonderful encore finish!\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A\n<u>2nd Set</u>: A\nOverall = 5 stars\n\nHighlights:\nWhole show\n\nSOURCES: SBD sources have long been deforested by the sparkling clarity of the official release. But for the historical trade, the vernon_23661 is best, needing just <u>-1% pitch adjustment</u> for U.S. Blues. It has the original tunings and introduction (trimmed from the official by as much as 17secs in places). The cousinit_18512 runs way too fast.",

Your time and expertise are invaluable and so appreciated.\n\nThe sound is excellent and the band is playing hard and with so much feeling. Jerry absolutely shreds this night and the rest of the band is right with him. Big props to Phil this night especially (as usual). It starts with Help>Slip>Franklin's (2nd one ever) and takes off from there. The Eyes is glorious with amazing Jerry runs and Phil playing that incredible lead bass. A great Sugaree, Big River and GDTRFB. All of this show is on a higher plane. You can not just hear it, but you can feel it! IMO, the absolute HIGHLIGHT of this show is the Stronger then Dirt. Words just don't do it justice. It is absolutely incredible and sound to behold forever. They really take it to the promised land! Jerry's playing is interstellar and some of the finest playing you'll hear from him or anyone, at anytime. Don't miss it. \n\nBTW, the Eyes is right after Roses (track 6). It is not separated out. ",

Somehow I ended up alone in a dark room at a friend\u2019s house with a head full of psilocybin and a cassette of this show on a nice sound system on a comfortable chair looking out a window. What was so cool was to be able to take in the music in that quiet situation in a deeper way than I had at the shows I\u2019d seen given all of the wonderful craziness that goes along with the scene. I felt like this was the night that Dead music entered into my DNA where it\u2019s lived ever since. I learned (lucky for us today especially for the younguns who never saw the band) that you could have quite a Grateful Dead experience through the recordings and I\u2019ve been listening almost every day for the 40 years since. Needless to say this recording and show hold a special place in my heart. ",
