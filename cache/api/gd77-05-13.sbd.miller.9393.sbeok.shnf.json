I was at this show and cherish the memories.  \n\nThe band was definitely lit up.  Exceptional tunes include Ramble on Rose, Brown Eyed Women, Cassidy, Jack-A-Roe, Scarlet/Fire, and the best Samson and Delilah I've ever heard.  \n\nThis is clearly the pre-FM tape.  It contains a horrendous flaw starting about 3/4 of the way through Going Down the Road.  The story goes that someone spilled a beverage on a piece of equipment or cable associated with the radio feed.  Whatever it was, it did not affect the house sound, but appparently the Healy tape has never surfaced and David Gans says he has checked the vault.  \n\nToo bad, but still a gem.  \n\nThis man is too fast.  He needs four hundred and fifty. \n\nKyle",

      "review_text": "Dr. Beechwood It's obvious the band is in a good mood for this somewhat overlooked show. Music opener nice, not quite as huge as it would be as a closer. They debut Jack-A-Roe, which isn't as fast as it would get, but good to hear nonetheless. \nThe Scarlet>Fire set closer is very nice, with intense guitar peaks in the solo to Scarlet, and jerry tearing up each lead spot in Fire (i especially like the one he does with the octave effect on). \nAfter Bobby explains the first rule of rock and roll, they start Samson. Samson is scorching, it reminds me of 7/8/78. It leads into a Bertha that loses the energy somewhere in the middle (Phil stops for a verse). Jerry gets particularly inventive on the Estimated outro, and picks back up in that mindset with a very laid back Other One, featuring intricate lead lines by Jerry. Eventually, it's just Jerry out in space. After about 4 minutes, the band returns, much louder this time, and Weir delivers the verse.\nThe jam winds down and sets pace for a slow, well sung Stella, my favorite of the year along with 5/18 (although they botch the descending line at the end). Then the tape goes to shit in GDRTFB.\nGood show, not quite as energetic or tight as some others around it, but that facilitates some great moments.",

The second set begs to be listened to in one sitting and while the soundboard version here is outstanding in quality, the drum solo is edited, which is too bad. The (relatively short) drum solo was so much a part of fabric of this show that it's a shame it's not all included here. \n\nI strongly recommend the download for the unique second set whose intensity rises and falls, and a Garcia who pulls out riffs and phrases (from somewhere) not to be repeated again IMHO. Definitely a rare performance from one of their peak periods.",

I have been unable to listen to anything else since.\nThe '77 shows are a real joy and for me the band at its best.  It's amazing, reading through some of the reviews in the Archive, how passionate folks are about certain periods in the Dead's 30 year history which is a real testament to how great of a band it was.  The fact that they were able to touch so many different people over so many years has always left me to believe there was  some divine guidance in the band ever being - but enough blathering.\nThis is one of my favorites from '77 with great sound and tight performances all around.

Donna certainly was less of a drag than Vince, hands down...I maintain that Jer may still be alive today if they would have gone in another direction on the keyboards...VW literally bored Jer to death.",

Most of the complaints seem to be about those occasional over the top moments. Listen to 5-26-77 LLRain. It borders on being downright pretty and definately some of the finest harmony you will find before Brent came along. She is probably lucky to have survived that time with the band with her sanity intact, being that she was the only female in the band. It would be funny as hell if she had a vote in whether to allow this site to exist and after reading the anti-donna stuff gave it thumbs down.  Anyway...this show is a good example of why \"best ever\" labels are misleading. This night does'nt owe a thing to 5-8-77. These recordings will be thirty years old next year and the sound quality is mindnumbing. Leave Donna alone, she's probably a really nice person and she was a better backup singer option than Phil, Mickey or Bill. Funny Donna moment...You Ain't Woman Enough from 2-17-73",

You feel like you are  on the crest of a wave.  This version is different.  Just listen to the drums.  The snare is only hit once in the beat when normally I think it is at least two.  Basically, it makes me think they were tripping.  Reeeaaal loose.\n\nTMNS was a great opener.  Ramble as always is great.  Cassidy is awesome.  BEW had a very sparse feeling.  FOTD is real nice.  Slow.  El Paso has some nice drums.  Sampson is a great 2nd set opener, and Bobby is really growling about the lion's den.

At this point I shouldn't be amazed at any '77 show, but here I am again singing the praises of one of the most remarkable shows from a most remarkable year.\n\nFirst--this, even among the gold standard that is the Betty Board, stands out as one of the cleanest, purest, most unadulterated pieces of sound anywhere.Vocals are crystal clear, the guitars ring out in power AND subtelty, and Keith's piano trinkles in sweet flowing harmony with the rest. \n\nDonna haters? Give her a chance here. She's more in tune with Jerry, even on Scarlet, and shines on TMNS and StelllaBlue.\n\nHighlights: Gorgeous, set-ending SCARLET>FIRE....there are 2 kinds of S>F...some feature the jam in the bridge between the 2 songs...this one features a short but expertly played Scarlet, and then the Fire starts w/a definitive \"here it is\" intro from Phil..the groove is just infectious, and Jerry solos some great wah-wah before the first verse even begins...no lyrical flubs, and it just rips from there.\n\nA kick-ass SAMSON that feeds into a mellow, but surprisingly engaging BERTHA.\n\nTHE OTHER ONE is a throwback to hints of the old '72 space-laden versions, but focused and hot at once, and it falls like a dew drop onto a rose into a seriously beautiful STELLA BLUE. Add a typically smoking GDTRFB after that.\n\nJust (another) incredible show from May of '77 that gets lost in the shadow of the legendary Cornell and Buffalo shows that precede it and the amazing June Winterland run to follow.\n\nDon't pass this up.",

The entire first set is nothing short of wonderful. The Scarlet/Fire is exceptional. The Scarlet is concise and well played with some very fine soloing from Jerry, and the band takes OFF on Fire. This show also has the best version I've ever heard of Samson And Delilah, wow. The Drums unfortunately is truncated and the sound goes to hell during/after, however the music is still at a wonderfully high quality. The Other One is particularly tasty. Be aware though that from GDTRFB to shows end is unlistenable because of the horrible distorted recording. I guess the tape got damaged somehow. This show runs the gamut from one of the best sounding recordings to one of the worst SBDs I've ever heard. It still gets five stars though. Whats listenable is just that good.

It probably suffers b/c it doesn't contain any specific standout performance, ie 5/8 S>F, 5/9 Comes a Time and so on. To echo captdbldose, this is def one of the better TOOs from the era. In truth, 76-78 are not peak years for the other one. Sure there are a few big boys but the majority can be described as standard, albeit well played. 7/17/76 is absolutely on point, one of the finest ever played, and the fact that one of the finest, if not \"the\" finest, post 1974 eyes of the world is sandwiched inside either side just raises it even higher. 10/15/76, 5/1/77, 5/13/77, 5/18/77, and 11/5/77 are the others of the period that are up there with this one.

Samson is outstanding, even in a great year for Samson! The Other One is just about the way I like them, one of my faves.  IMHO, this Stella Blue is one of the all-timers, along with 6/18/74 and a handful of others.\nGranted, the band is not as \"tight\" as many nights this month, but they shine very brightly in a good number of spots.  I'll give it a 4 1/2, which rounds up to a 5!\nTwo other quick notes: First, the sound is very high quality.  However, if you have bass-heavy speakers like mine (Bose), you might want to turn the bass down quite a bit.  Otherwise, perfect.  Lastly, I think an \"It was what it was\" mindset is the appropriate one to take when listening to the band in any incarnation.  Donna Jean contributed some things that gave the band an unforgettable sound during this era, and her frequent caterwauling was just one freaky part of the wonderful package the Godchaux's brought to the GD table.

The combination of this recording and the very tight performance almost makes this sound like a record release, it's that tightly played.  Great 1st set w/ nice clear vocals from Jerry and some hot pickin to. FOTD is great during this period, although I think 78' is even better.  I've noticed some riffing on the Donna controversy in reviews here.  One listen to this FOTD and anyone with ears can tell she cannot sing harmony.  Shame, she has a beautiful voice and I love her studio recordings with the band (check out the album Keith and Donna, if you can find it from 1975).  Fortunately for us deadheads the band does have a great harmony vocalist, his name is Jerry.  Just listen to his wonderful harmony with Bobby on El Paso.  I actually thought the Estimated was the record for a minute at first, it's that well played.  If they had post drums with the same sound quality this would compete with many a show from this year, but alas it just slips away.  Well worth a listen to the first set though.

Tremendously tight, moody, dynamic show! \n\nOne of the ways I judge a show is not only by how great they perform the songs I love, but the ones I'm usually not crazy about. Samson & Delilah is never one of my faves (I heard the Rev. Gary Davis version first, forever ruining the GD's version for me), but this one SMOKES, holy cow. Also, though I'm not a Donna fan generally, her soulful crooning during the outro of Fire gives me goosebumps (way to go, lady!)--I can usually skip Bertha, but why would I when this bounces and swings with such confident laid-back intensity, and the levels are so perfect and the guitars so lovely?

The show was FM broadcasted (but not simulcasted), so it used to circulate. But BITD it was hard to come across a good gen, well-pitched, that made it worthwhile. Hearing the complete show even now takes a little effort. Billy & Mickey prankstered the opening, taking the stage in the guise of Drs. Beechwood & Shot. There's a helluva sequence in the 1st set and a strong 2nd set, though presumably you first heard the 17th, two shows later, since it's one of the best ever. This is close to that level. May '77<b>:</b> it's like <i>that</i>.\n\nFirst Set. Some of the beginning characters-goof  is cut from the OFF. The opening slot is a jammer, getting better as it goes. Typically '77 versions of the next few are made better by Keith, who is in more of a cocktail mood than barrelhouse or rag. These are played solidly into <i>Minglewood</i>, but just hang in there as this goes big, continuing into a strong <i>Friend of the Devil</i> [@6:28 miller_9393 & ashley_14942 have a 45sec cut in the solo; the OFF has a 26sec cut @6:45; unknown_6690 is complete]. The sequence starting at <i>Jack-a-Roe</i> is classic stellar May '77. This is the first Roe (well, of the new arrangement \u2013 it was a redux from earlier folk days). It's one of 8 songs (incl. three covers) added in '77. This salsa-ish arrangement was nailed first time out! Not sure why they waited this far into the tour, but they then played it 5 more times. On <i>Looks Like Rain</i> Donna is good and the band's tighter than a pig's ass walking uphill. <i>Scarlet</i> is hot, even if not a big jam version. First Bobby stops, then restarts when Jer stops playing, so Donna hums and Mickey plays cowbell, until Phil thumps into <i>Fire</i>. It's weird and interesting. The two-chord vamp of the latter doesn't always go somewhere, but this one is up there with 5/17 & 5/21. Though already the 11th one, Jer tries a lyrical variant, having sung \"The thin line beyond\" several times. \n\nSecond Set. That power didn't evanesce over the break, starting with the second ace <i>Samson</i> in a row. <i>Bertha</i> is much livelier than the night before, and the <i>Estimated</i> is one of the tour's best (it's not 5/15 or 5/28, but that's to quibble). The miller_9393 is missing most of the fast <i>Drums</i> [there's more on unknown_6690; it's complete on the OFF]. It becomes clear that it can't go anywhere else but <i>The Other One</i> [the miller_9393 has a 4sec cut @9:18; the OFF has a 19sec cut @14:36; the unknown_6690 is complete]. You can't really ask for a better <i>Stella</i>. Bobby is great, Keith is perfectly cocktailish and it segs into an equally strong <i>Goin' Down the Road</i>. Even with a board sizzle that affects all sources, it's great [the OFF surreptitiously substitutes w/the entirety of 6/8 \u2013 rather than a patch or fade out]. The poor sound improves a bit for the solid <i>One More Saturday</i> [the OFF wholly replaces with 5/28 and the solo from 5/21]. The encore is typical of the era.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: B+\nOverall = 4\u00bc stars\n\nHighlights:\nJack-a-Roe \u2013 1st one & nailed \nLooks Like Rain \u2013 Donna good, band tight\nScarlet Begonias \u2013 solid & turns out interesting\nFire on the Mountain \u2013 pretty varied\nSamson & Delilah \u2013 so many great ones on this tour, but still\nEstimated Prophet \u2013 fantastic almost nightly in this era\nStella Blue \u2013 check Bobby & Keith supporting Jer\nGoin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad \u2013 even  with a fried final \u2153, still a top version\n\nSOURCES: Each of the three SBD sources has pros/cons. All have a board fizzle-out on the ending section of GDtRFB that continues into 1MSN and is fixed for the encore, and they are variously missing 3>5mins of Drums. The unknown_6690 is the FM feed and the most complete, with tunings, and a more natural hall sound, if less clarity. The miller_9393 is the cleanest/best overall, but it (and the ashley_14942) also has cuts in FotD and TOO. The ashley_14942 is EQd, but lovingly, and it smooths out the fizzled section via narrowing in & out of mono. <b>May 1977</b> has most of the show, with the complete Drums, but edited versions of FotD & TOO, and it omits both GDtRFB & 1MSN from this night.",

      "review_text": "More Magical May 77- n2 Chi  Lot of talk about this great show that largely floats under the radar, perhaps less so since the release of the May 1977 box set, but nevertheless still. Then again, in a year -- a month -- a week even! -- that boasts of so many great shows, it's understandable that this one might have gotten lost in the mix. Just look at the week leading up to 13 May: Boston on the 7th, Cornell the 8th, Buffalo the 9th, St. Paul on the 11th, and first night Chi on the 12th.  \n\nThe first set opens with some playful banter about Dr. Beachwood, then rips into The Music Never Stopped and closes with Scarlet-Fire. Phil's bass can sometimes sound heavy in the mix, but his abrupt drop into Fire is not to be missed. Headyversion ranks it as the 18th best version. Not clear what exactly happens during the transition to the rest of the band, but Phil fills in more than suitably. All that's there in between the set opener and closer does not disappoint, either. Choice Ramble on Rose, short but sweet and tight Cassidy, really lovely Friend of the Devil, the first Jack-A-Roe, and what headyversion ranks as the sixth best Looks Like Rain. \n\nSet two opens with a solid Samson (tied with May 28 at fourth on headyversion), typically strong '77 versions of Bertha and Estimated, before transitioning into the highlight of the show: the other one. Hailed as the best of the year, after nearly 17 minutes it transitions into Stella. The boys are getting loose. \n\nUnfortunately, the audio faulters after Stella (GDTRFB, Sat Night closer, and encore US Blues). ",
