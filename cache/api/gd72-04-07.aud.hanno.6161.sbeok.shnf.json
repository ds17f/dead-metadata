Unfortunately, the second AUD patch through drums and the first part of TOO is STUNNINGLY awful. Thank God that The Other One>Wharf Rat is on Steppin' Out in fantastic SBD quality. \n\nHowever, this is definitely not recommended for the casual observer or a novice GD collector.

When the sound is this bad, you're really not getting anything even close to what the audience heard.

Both audience sources archived here are extremely poor in sound quality, rendering both transfers virtually unlistenable. Perhaps due to Wembley being a \"chilly, cavernous sports facility\" this performance is not of the same caliber as many of the subsequent performances. But despite it's rather poor reputation, the music available from vault reel sources is excellent, particularly the jam suite on disk three of the Steppin' Out release. \n\nThe first set is unremarkable, with the exception of a well played China/Rider. The second set kicks off with an excellent performance of Truckin' that includes a very nice Garcia solo. After a drum break, it segues into a superb Other One featuring a brief Me and My Uncle Jam and a very nice melodic space segment. The reprise gets quite jazzy and there is some marvelous interplay between Jerry and Keith before the second verse. \n\nAthough quite a few of the following shows on the tour feature more spectacular performances of The Other One, this one is certainly worthy of its inclusion on the official release. \n(92 pts*)\n\n*If this performance was released in its entirety from vault reel masters it would garner a score in the mid-nineties!",

I have to admit for once every reviewer made a bit of sense. what can one say but yes the dead put on a good show as usual. whoever was doing all the whistling next time take the mic out of the ass of whoever was stanidng next to you cause it sure sounded like whoever it was had to be standing pretty much close to you cause that was pretty much the clearest sound of the whole show.  unless it was the whistler himself then he was whistling through his ass with the mic down his throat. either way, there's two different downloads of the show, unless both persons were one and the same person, that must be something privy to England - recording with mics up one's ass.  it's no one wonder it's called golly ole england. i'll give the show a three just because through all the shit the mic was surrounded by the dead still performed up to par and you can't fault them because of some one or two lazy assholes getting his or her or their jollys off by putting the mic up his or her ass.",

(This show is on <b>E72 Complete</b>, <b>E72 Vol2</b> and <b>Steppin' Out</b>, though the latter actually used the lesser second set). It's charged with the energy of being the opening night, an energy which carried over to the more-renowned following night. The next night may be better overall but for one of the greatest first sets of '72 you want this show. This was the first of three trips to England in just two months, for a total of 8 English shows (the final shows were added as an apology to playing an arena! They played this 12000-seater due to the closure of the Rainbow).\n\n<i>Greatest Story</i> starts the first set with a bang and the peppy pace pushes right through the set. One of the first <i>Chinatown</i>s clarifies how it morphed into US Blues. <i>Uncle</i> is so good that it must have hurt not to include it on the original <b>Europe 72</b> (they couldn't repeat any from <b>Skull Fuck</b> because that was the current LP at the time - though Garcia's solo album had also since been released, even if it was a rarity in the UK. This Uncle was used, however, on <b>E72v.2</b>). The original triple LP used nothing from this show though it used one from the folowing night. Shame. <i>China>Rider</i> is absolute insanity - such a stellar version it almost brings me to tears. In the 80s/90s, a peak like this would have signaled the end of the 1st Set and must have seemed that way to the uninitiated Brits (whom would not have been familiar with most of the material, as is apparent on the AUDs). When the band kept playin' on British skullcaps must have exploded. I wonder how many came the next night or went up to Newcastle (or even on to the continent). On the <b>Europe 72 Complete</b> set for this show <i>Big Boss Man</i> is missing the last minute so you have to go to the AUDs. <i>Black-throated Wind</i> has a pop that it never had with two drummers and that went missing by the 80s. This song was a piss-break for me back in the day but I'd have been glued to a '72. <i>Loser</i> was probably improved when Phil stopped singing but here...Phil sings! <i>Mr Charlie</i> r e a l l y f r e a k i n p o p s. Where was this pop a year later and why wasn't this version used instead of 5/23 for <b>E72</b>? I'm not sure a better <i>BioDtL</i> exists (I'll grant you that there were several great ones from the 17 on this tour)! <i>Tennessee</i> is a mind-blower. It should have never lost this tempo and, again, why not this version instead of all the Paris stuff on <b>E72</b>? The set then falls to merely average but you have to go to the AUDs again for <i>Casey Jones</i>, the only place it exists. It's interesting that the two AUDs in circulation are of notably lesser quality than what circulates from American shows of the year. Perhaps an example, between the two countries, of:\na)the interest of bootleggers\nb)the available technology\nc)the level of fandom at the time\nRegardless, Brits were handed one of the best first sets of the early 70s.\n\nThe first half of the average (for 72) second set was miscreantly used for <b>Steppin Out</b> and others were used for <b>E72v2</b>, e.g. <i>Truckin'</i>, used on both, though there are better ones from the tour (the same mistake the first E72 also made, in using 5/26). <i>Drums</i> comes right after the first song (with stand-alone songs appearing later in the set); not a 72 highlight in general, but Bill's better here. A 33-minute <i>Other One</i> (with an <i>El Paso</i> in the middle) was better elsewhere on this tour (5/3, 5/26, a couple others) but the segue out of <i>El Paso</i> is funny in its un-deadness (everybody but Bobby just jumps). Set highlight <i>Sugar Mag</i> is another that benefits from a sole drummer and the version here is better than the one from Paris used on E72 (there were 21 on this tour).\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0A+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall: 4 1/2 stars* \n\n<u>Show Highlights</u>:\nEntire 1st Set with landmark versions of:\nMe & My Uncle\nChina Cat>Rider\nMr Charlie\nBeat it On Down\nTennessee Jed\n<i>plus</i>\nSugar Magnolia\nGoin' Down the Road (best-of-tour contender)\nOne More Saturday Night\n\nBest Sources:\nThe sirmick.31329 is best for the missing minute of <i>Big Boss Man</i> but hanno.6161 is the better source for the missing <i>Casey Jones</i>.\n\n*for the show, not the AUD.

      "review_text": "Review done based on Europe 72 Release I know the AUD of this is a tough listen!\n\nGSET, the first song of the tour\u2026 wailing! Bob is on fire, and Jerry is all over it. A+ version\nSugaree is also an A+, for the same reasons as above. The excellent SQ of the source makes me wonder how much some of the shows I\u2019ve been more down on this song have suffered because of SQ issues?\nChinatown Shuffle maintains the energy.\nMAMU is a rollicking good time, don\u2019t particularly like Pigpen\u2019s organ work.\nChina>Rider is going at a nice, fast pace, as has the whole show thus far. While not particularly jammed out, it definitely rocks out.\nBig Boss Man is funky and fun. Nice work Pig.\nBTW, this is definitely one of the faster paced versions of this song I\u2019ve heard, which makes sense considering the pace of the playing has been great. Bob hits some great, purposely(?) off tune chords in the chorus here and there.\nLoser is an A version, landing just short of the illusive X factor, and highly enjoyable. Great Phil work here.\nMr. Charlie features great Jerry during the solo.\nBIODTL, ahahaha, after they say \u201cHappy 4th of July\u201d, a subtle joke on two fronts, American Independence from the Crown, and of course, the difference between how Europe/America write their dates\u2026 7/4/72\u2026\nTN Jed, all that need be said, A+.\nPITB is shorter than it would be for most of the era, but the jam is intense and driven. A+.\nCasey Jones\n\nTruckin\u2019Drums>TOO>El Paso>TOO>Wharf Rat\nTruckin\u2019 begins our tour through the meat sequence in style. Jerry has a great tone and pushes the high notes in places he often doesn\u2019t later. While the build up lacks the clear explosion, the upside is it takes a steady free form jam out of it that eventually moves to drums. Phil bombs us into a ripping TOO. At the 5 minute mark we slow down and lose the theme, heading into somewhere spacey and calm. This doesn\u2019t last long as they head right back to the theme, I believe the reason is Jerry just couldn\u2019t remain calm this night. The rush through the verse and into a Jerry led jam that is theme-less and dark. Phil is pushing the dark angle well. Just before the 15 minute mark they start into a nice jam that has touches of the theme again, but mainly just grooves with some serious Phil, Bob and Jerry, which then falls into space again, and sensing that something needed to be done, a raspy Bobby starts the rhythm of El Paso. The rest of the band joins him for a nice ride through the badlands, before delving back into TOO, again at Bob\u2019s command. There\u2019s a hint of a Spanish Jam, again from Bob, but the band doesn\u2019t take the bait. They take their time getting to the 2nd verse, and we immediately land in a soulful and intense Wharf Rat that has a nice outro jam to it. Great meat sequence.\nRamble On\nSugar Magnolia has a nice wah effect in SSDD.\nNFA>GDTRFB>NFA\nBilly makes the call, and Buddy Holly it is. Great GDTRFB nestled in this sandwich.\n\nEncore: OMSN, as usual. This is the one that made Steppin\u2019 Out, so\u2026 yeah.\n\nPerformance Summary\nThe first set, first show of the legendary tour, and from the first song they are blazing. The 2nd set picks up right where they left off, all the water in the gigantic, empire sized pool steams away, and they are left playing on the bottom of the now empty pool.\n\nSound Quality\nA+ to the Europe 72 recording.",

That's a really tough call, I think, but the Dead came out of the gate in England absolutely blazing.  None of the Academy of Music shows compare to this.\n\nObviously the band knew what it was doing: setting the stage for the rest of the tour.  So they burned the place down.\n\n40+ year old review of the concert here:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/13/grateful-dead-classic-feature\n\n\"The main thing is getting off behind the music\" \u2013 Pigpen\n\n\"It is hard to talk about a band that one moment is being led by Garcia to sounds that are a part of pink padded tunnels that spiral down through the back byways of consciousness, and, moments later, follows Bob Weir, breaking into the John Wayne jukebox reality of Marty Robbins' El Paso \u2013 'One day a wild young cowboy came in, wild as wild Texas wind.'\"",
