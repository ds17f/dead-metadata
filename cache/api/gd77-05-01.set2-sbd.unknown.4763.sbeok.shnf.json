There is one major problem, and that is that the final line of Brokedown Palace cuts when Jerry sings \"Listen to the river sing sweet/\" Everything else is so good that it is difficult to complain, but when you hear, I mean don't hear it you too will feel like you've been slapped in the ear. It absolutely is worth the download. This is a six star recording, but it gets 5 because of the ommission.",

The Playing in the Band is so soupy and drippy that the songs played between the intro and reprise seem to just be lost in a sea of Playin', its some dope shit...one of those jams that really get you lost until its over!",

Moving a song forward at this slow pace is a great piece of work by the drummers.  Wonderful fills on piano, and what sounds like an organ.  Garcia's singing is among his most inventive:  \"guh-NUH-plant; a WEEEE-EEEP-in willow.\"  His solo is perfect.",

At around the 4 minute mark in \"Playin in the Band\", everything just starts floating. Sureal, and enchanting. \nDancin' , the Other One, Comes a Time, this one has it all. If only the Brokedown Palace wasnt cut, and the first set circulated too. Oh well, you cant ask for it all. This show is a true enjoyment,and the only 5 star rating I have ever given on archive.org.\n\n.Darkstr56.",

But \"The Other One\" > \"Comes A Time\" > \"Playin' Reprise\" sequence is showcase Dead.  \"The Other One\" is compact but powerful with tasy jamming, and the segue into \"Comes A Time\" is musical telepathy .  The jam at the end of \"Comes A Time\" is creative and fluid and oh-so-gradually weaves its way back into that familiar \"Playin\" motif.  Very enjoyable listening!\n\nAnd the \"Brokedown Palace\" is so beautiful and well-played that I don't even mind the last line being cut.\n\nGet this short but sweet one-disc download!",

The ballads are the best part. The first go-round of Playin goes nowhere. The Other One is decent enough but is nowhere over the top. Maybe one to listen to around your non-head friends if you don't want to flip them out with something with more muscle and smoke.",
