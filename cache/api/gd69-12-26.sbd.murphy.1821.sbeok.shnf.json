They both purport to be the first acoustic show, because of Bill being late. Im very interested in the band's transistion from the machine-eating psychedlic monster of the late 60's to the sweet/sad acoustic combo of the early 70's. Any ideas? For instance, was Bill actually late to both shows, leading to the same type of acoustic set as a result? And was it actually only serendipidy that led to the acoustic stuff. Naturally it became a mjor part of the trip during 1970 (with the NRPS shows). Also, has anyone else notoced how often NSB is described as a reaction to Kent State? The timeline seems to blow that analysis away... \nAt any rate, this is WONDERFUL music. Do yourself a favor and git it, right this very second.",

This one is better, if only because it's longer, highlighted by a nice Black Peter and semi-electric Uncle John's.  (not to mention Sadie)\n\nThe electric set is pretty good as well.  I liked the Dark Star, a typical 'stage II' version with some nice jams after the first verse. (Some good work by TC especially)  The cut at the end carries over to the beginning of New Speedway Boogie, which features some unusual backing vocals (not hard to see why they dropped them.)  (BTW, as someone mentioned, Hunter calls NSB an oblique comment on Altamont (my paraphrase.)Lovelight is short, but longer than the 10 minutes they supposedly had left.\n\nA 4 for the cuts, and for some sloppy vocals especially on HTH.\nSound is a 5 for '69;  I like how you can hear TC's organ.",

You are very lucky to have found this show. Down Load now, do not miss this show.\n\nThe first 6 tracks are just Jerry and Bobby on acoustic guitars.\n\nIt's nice to hear'em playing \"country\" music.\n\nThe rest of the DEAD arrive and they play UJB accoustically...then start the electric GRATEFUL DEAD with Casey Jones.\n\nGarcia's guitar sound is classic 1969. It's full of tone, color, dimension, and life.  \n\nHard to Handle sounds really good, nice organ playing. Pigpen nails this show with his singing and his playing. \n\nPigpen's playing is exceptional on organ. It's so nice to hear him. His playing is very tasty. He added a lot without ever playing solos. You can't say that about many \"organ/keyboard\" players.  \n\nI always liked Pigpen on organ. He played the spaces, filled in parts that connected the music like a needle & thread.  He had a sound no one else had. And played the Organ unlike the usual keyborad/organ players. \n\nBy the time Dark Star is performed the audience is DEAD QUITE. Blown away no doubt, in awe and stunned to witness a performance of this magnitude.\n\nBobby breaks a string and the band takes a break, Phil says in the mic: can't you people reach over and fondle the person next to you and create a little excitement in here?   \"grope a little, I mean it's dark\" \n\nSo quiet is the audience that Garcia says: Man this place is really quiet, no kidding are you people all sitting in the dark  watching us goof around up here? It's not like we are doing something important you know?, It's not that important man, if it was that important we wouldn't do it... \n\nDARK STAR. It's a Beatiful version of Dark Star too, there's even a \"tighten Up\" jam in it!! LMAO!! How can this be???  One of the Best versions there is. DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW.

      "review_text": "Almost a 4 star show... I really enjoyed this show. There is some great banter throughout and they just sound like they are having fun. They start out by informing the crowd that Billy is stuck on a plane somewhere and that they were going to go ahead and play a little while they wait. I\u2019m still not sure if this was unplanned or what \u2013 meaning I\u2019m not sure if the Acoustic was an improv type of deal or they had already planned it. There are some real gems in this acoustic set as well \u2013 I mean if the tune was not rare, it was still really well done. These \u201970 acoustic sets always seem to have a gospel feel to them and the harmonies are wonderful. \n\nThe kick things off with Monkey and the Engineer, and it was OK, never really been a favorite of mine. I like the latter versions better than the prior. Little Sadie is next, and what a wonderful version this is. I always wished this was played more, and I pretty much dig any and all versions out there. The whole \u201d44 smokeless\u2019 line gets me every time. During Long Black Limo them seemed to start really feeling it. Serious Jug band shit right here. Been all Around this World comes on next and I have always been a sucker for this one. Jerry pulls this one off really well, and his vocals are sounding really awesome this show. Prior to this show, I had never heard Gathering Flowers for the Masters Bouquet. Its got a gospel feel to it and Bobby does really well with it \u2013 almost surprisingly well. Songs like this are not so easy to pull off well, and does a great job. Black Peter follows, and it is the best of the first set imo. What an incredible job of telling the story by Jerry, plus the incredibly slow tempo coupled with the acoustic flair make this a true gem. Beautiful job by Jerry right here. UJB seemed as if they were having a little trouble getting it going or something, and it never really came together in my opinion. Hey eventually got it together and ended up pulling it off pretty nicely. What a nice acoustic set that was! Heartfelt and sincere feeling. I really enjoyed that listen. It has been a while since I treated myself to some early acoustic like this. All in all, fantastic first set. \n\nThe second set kicks off with Casey, and it really did not impress me too much. Jerry does some interesting soloing towards the end, but nothing to groundbreaking here. Next up is Pig\u2019s first appearance with Hard to Handle, and I have to say this one did not do too much for me either. Seems to not really get it going to strong until about half way through when jerry shreds his first solo seemingly trying to get everyone else jump started. Good not great \u2013 AND this is one tune I think TC should stay completely out of. His accents here are worthless imo. CRS follows and it is the earlier surf style which I generally dig, but again, this seems a little flat to me. I just was not impressed at all by this one. NOW, the China>Jam>Rider>High Time comes up next and it is fucking incredible. I mean this thing is form another planet. Also, this is the first time I can really start hearing Phil well and he certainly does not disappoint. At about the 4 min mark of China shit really takes off and never comes back down. This little teeny jam tucked in between China and Rider is absolutely incredible. They seem to just escalate this one more and more until it busts right outta they freaking building. WOW, that was something. The High Time is perfectly placed ands allows the crowd to catch their collective breath before unleashing a really unique MAMU(if that is possible). Yes it is possible and this one almost has a bluesy or soulful feel to it. Bobby really gives it hell and clears the table just in time for this evenings masterpiece, Dark Star. This is classic Live Dead style jammage here, with a sprinkle of semi drifty shit going on a la 72-73. I was just taken by this one, my notes are somewhat light because I was listening so closely and not writing so much. At the 16 minute mark I could not tell if the jam turned into a \u2018Tighten-Up\u2019 or \u2018Feelin Groovy\u201d, but either way it just beautiful. Can anyone clarify that one for me? I was so impressed by this I gave a second spin on the spot. Classic, classic Jerry right here. Loved it, cant say enough. Probably need to listen to it about 10 or 15 more times to catch everything in there. TC is such a big part of this DS, plus most from this era. The cut is brutal, but \u2013 what the hell ya gonna do? The jump from their right into a cut, but really nice New Speedway Pig winds the evening up with a shit hot Lovelight. Really well done n an otherwise Pig free show. They wind the living shit outta this one and absolutely freakin erupt at the end. Im not sure how long it is, but I think it clocks in at around 25 min and all of the necessary elements are evident in this one. Success for sure and that is that. \n\nThoughts \u2013 I really liked this one, and it was really fun to listen to. I was never bored, even when I thought they were just kinda forcing it. I thought everything before China was kinda forced and not too good, and everything after really kicked ass. The whole acoustic set was really good and definitely worth the listen. If the second set started a little stronger and they could continued the energy throughout, I think this coulda been an all timer. This one definitely flies under the radar and it is a true gem. Like I said, I was just looking for a Christmas show and looked up \u201969 first because of all the great shows right around this one. Impressive for sure. I give this show a good solid A, and it would have been higher with a little stronger showing at the start of the second set. I definitely recommend this show. Merry Christmas and Cheers everyone!",

I should be nice, but feeling pigpen rolling over in his grave reading that this is almost a  star show with not much besides a good dark star? Who gives a rat's ass about Dark Star anyway. Just a high brow Space, for trippers. BTW, the best dark star is 10/25 or 6/69...\n\nMost of it rocks. \n\nAs for actual songs, where Jerry's manic, clear, screaming guitar shines, this show is an easy 5 star. Manic but mellow and controlled here. Love it. \n\n\nThe hard to handle is hotter than hell.",

Only reason I give this a 4 is because the cuts listed in the notes do hit hard during the show but on the other hand this is a very nice early acoustic/electric show from very late 1969 that would become more standard in 1970.\nThis one is definitely a keeper!",

      "review_text": "\"You just had it done to ya by the Grateful Dead!\" Truth! Best Lovelight so far, and it's hard to imagine them topping it. Not only does everyone nail the boxback, but Pig actually gets the rhythm right on stingray for once ... both rare in isolation, unheard of in combination. Even Bobby's caterwauling towards the end is in key! Give me this one over the 45-minute rambles any day.\n\nDarkstar, etc. also solid, though the cuts are rough as noted.",

The transition from the seemingly impromptu acoustic to full electric was so cool, and the ending Dark Star through Lovelight was dynamite. I was incredibly pleased to find this concert at archive.org some 50 years later.",
