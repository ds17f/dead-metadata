I was at this one.For some reason,the vibe was on the minute you walked into that concrete jugle(Giants stadium).I have never seen so much lightning in my life.I told my buddy that L.lightning would be nice.Never happened.The first note of stranger was so intense that people were jumping over the big blue wall that seperates the field form the seats.I remember seeing a guy jump and break his arm.As soon as the second set started,he was in a sling,dancin in the lightning storm!Only at a dead show!Now to the music.The first set was prety standard and well played.The second set was unexpected to say the least.Lightning,lightning lightning!John Sheir(promoter) comes on stage for a weather annoucment.Jer walks on slowly and looks up to sky!He gave this shaking head sort of expression and it was on!\nNice foolish opener,but an even better Just aliitle light.Thats right.Just a liitle light was smokin!!!The Nevllies joined them at the end of set.All in all,this show is worth the download!Sound quaity is an A-.Nice SBD.I taped the show,but the rain won that day!!!!\nENJOY!!!!!",

Over the top show...Does anyone remember John Sher saying to the whole stadium, \"you're all going to die, get off the field.?\"  ...Outside on top of car was this big Jerry-lookin' guy...\"It's what it's all about, havin' a good time...\"  Echoes through my mind today reminding me.  Stranger-->Franklin's Tower and I thought the show must be about to end....haha.  That night, things were happening at light years a second...Those in attendance this night know.  Electri-city By Tennessee Jed, the downpour rain and lightning was scarily intense.  Like at any minute, the whole place could be fried by a gazillion killowatt lighting blast...the band didn't seem to care...In fact they welcomed it..and almost seemed to egg it on in a innocent sort of way....This was the first of many times I realized how the Boys had the ability to control weather patterns.  As the played Music Never, Jerry seemed to in control of this specific lightning storm. You know when they do a Don't Ease after a Music Never, it's a rockin' time.  Fooish Heart was a different planet...Brent was telling us how it is w/Lil' Light...\"Ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care.\"  The Neville's coming out added mysticism to the night beyond recalled comparison.....This sound quality is a 4 star btw, but I hope you understand that being at this show 20th row with 80,000 people? \nmakes it 5 star for sure!",

What a beautifully sweet jam after such an amazing UJB.  You must hear it, it is what GD were all about for me - a divine experience. I only wish they had explored post UJB territiry more often rather than just drop everything into drums as was all too often the case.  Although it is GS with 65,000 plus fans, the boys sound cozy and comfortable and tight like they are playing for a few of their best friends.  The guest appearance does not dissapoint.  Sounds like they were playing together for years.  Not muddied and muddled like alot of guest appearances. This show, 2nd set in particular must be enjoyed by all.",

      "review_text": "My First Show- Glad to see it posted So I wanna write the type of review that sends tingles down your spine. The Spinetingler89........... so we went down to the stadium early that day as I had never been to the likes of a dead show and my friends were eager to show what all the brewhaha was about. What I  saw resembled a flea market on acid. Now I have been to flea markets and I have done acid but never Fleacid Market. Boy was I in for a life altering experience. My knowledge of the dead was a grestest hits cassette and whatever was being played on the classic rock stations, this was the middle of the whole touch of grey influx of people into the scene and there were folks of all strains present and accounted for. I would like to say we wandered around the lot and looked at all the freaks but I hardly recall much before we entered the stadium. A breif instance of ingesting some form of sacrament and a run in with my friends baseball cap that was really strange. The first of many strange things to come that evening. \nWe got inside before the show started and I remember all the people flowing over the walls onto the floor like water once the band started playing. I remember the rain- I also remember the undeniable electricity in the air- we were onto something beyond all our control and all you could do was hold on and smile. Somehow we made it down onto the floor and up into the sea of people and at one point we were ridiculously close to the stage. I remember how everyone knew the words to uncle johns band. The I sort of recall the encore and next thing I know we were in parking lot eating kind veggy pasta and trying to make sense of some paper that was not preferated. Yup life changed that evening and I have not looked at the world the same way. \nPretty cool to see this show up here. I forever had a really bad audience copy of the show and then about 5 years ago I got a videotape copy of the big screen feeds from that very show. It is the stuff that you would see up their in all its psychadelic glory. Anyone else ever see this video or is it somewhat under the radar? Its great quality and I have no idea where it originated. A friend who had not been to the show but collected all forms of media in a reckless manor came across it. Probably came out of NYC if I had to guess who who knows?????????  I have the thing encoded into a mpg on my hardrive but never got around to mastering a dvd. 80+ shows later it all came to end.  Miss that fat fucker!",

      "review_text": "Oh how it rained.... This was the 5th and final show of our Dead Tour Honeymoon.  It was a typical scorching hot and humid day in Northern NJ, with the haze that can only mean \"thunderstorm\".  Part way through Set 1, it started to rain.  The Dead played a \"Music Never Stopped\" like I have never before or since heard.  It was incredible - by this time the rain was coming down in buckets and we could barely see the stage, and it was thundering and lightening.  Everyone and everything was soaked, \"but the band kept playin' on\".  One of the spookiest moments was right after Bobby sings the line \"balls of lightnin' roll along\", a lightening bolt actually hit one of the towers above the stadium.  On the tape, you can hear the crowd let out a collective shreak of glee that comes in a weird place in the song.  The jam at the end was AMAZING.  Everyone was dancing like maniacs.  When I listen to the tape of it in the car, I can't help but car-dance and yell \"whoo!\", it's THAT good.  The rain began to subside as they segued into \"Don't Ease\".  After Set 1, an announcer came on stage and begged people to clear the field b/c of the inclement weather.  Later, we heard that funnel clouds had been spotted in the area.  WOW!  What a way to end our Honeymoon!!!",

It's still very good, but it just lacks a little bit of energy that most of these 89 summer shows have LOTS of. I do LOVE the \"you know your bound to wind up WET\" line that Jerry pulls on TJed right after the rain starts during Masterpiece.

When I saw hundreds of people surge over the opposite lower tier railing, (and secutity run over there) I grabbed my friends and we took a 20 foot plunge onto the field.  We ran until we were immersed in the crowd about 30 rows back from the stage.  I had always dug the Dead as a casual fan up until seeing this show.  I \"got it\" right away.  When it truly seemed that the lightning storm (With tornado warnings)was entirely in sync with the music (and the vibe) that sealed my fate as a deadhead.  I'll always regret not \"getting it\" sooner but I'm be glad to be counted amongst the converted.  My rating is far from objective relative to sound and set list as it was an amazing experience I'll never forget.  \n\nToday at 40 I follow a band  called the Radiators who have a grown up deadhead like following.

What I really like here are those 2 and a half minutes of jamming during Sugar Magnolia (from about 3:00 to 5:15).  My liquid Jerry and the rest of the band locked into a tight groove.

Though previous night has it's great moments too. And the Sugar Mags on this night, is now my new fave version i measure all others! I had previously found the 89 Freedom Hall Sugar Mags my fave, and had also attended that show.  This one is another melodic rhythmic GEM.  Jerry locks in as AceHigh4's review describes. and Brent and the drummers, heck everyone, are beasts.  Drummers on this recording sound MASSIVE as they were at the show.  Also caught on this recording, Jerry is on top playing these sweetly piercing lead lines more so than in other versions and gets more pronounced as the song progresses. As others have said, the Neville Bros band played & sang from the drums segment until the end and they added an extra punch & spice to the proceedings.  just an outstanding show. I was way out in the middle of the stadium on the first row of the first tier and everything sounded fantastic. I agree that the \"new tunes\" were exceptionally played.  Jerry guitar picked his face off that night.  You could hear him so clearly even as far as we were. When the rain stopped he was very clear sounding & expressive. Mickey was stellar during drums and made up for any issues he had in the 1st set.  1st set may seem a bit off because the rain was also getting onto the stage and on Mickey in particular. The youtube vid of the show bears this out. But by the 2nd set everything & everybody was/were all in synch. ....and how did Mickey and Billy get to sample or do a fantastic improv drum & techno cover based on Jimi Hendrix's \"May this be love\" (also known as Waterfall as pointed out by UtmostBeast describing the dusborne matrix version of this show).  Starting in track 14, first obscurely around 1:50 and sounding almost exactly like it at 2:30 and then goes into a fantastic soulful rhythmic improv, and incorporates the large overhead drums, snare high hat, toms, talking drum, etc....Simply stunning!  I remember being so caught up in a drums segment like never before!!!  probably the best drums (and bass & midi) & space i have ever heard until this day from all of the boots and releases. Again, the Sugar Mags was excellent!  PS Dew was spectacular after the downpour and everyone was chilling in the after glow mist & concert lights that was lingering over the stadium...Jerry up on the big scream singing and strumming. simply perfect soundtrack to the evening by the band and captured in this recording.",
