I was about 10 feet in front of Phil when the boys came out to tune up.  There was a group of other young guys standing there that started shout ing to Phil, \"Jack Straw...!\"  I love Jack Straw, so I joined in the shouting (remember this was an east coast show).\nPhil looked up and smiled and nodded at us.  We continued shouting until the boys launched into the Shakedown opener.  We Grooved...\nAfter Shakedown, we resumed our pleas to Phil.  Phil smiled at us, then walked over to Jerry and Bobby.  They spoke for a second, nodded then launched into a rocking Jack Straw.\nWe Grooved...  \nSound quality on this recording is awesome.  414's are phenomenal mics, and if used properly, as this taper did, they produce awesome results.\nWhile crowd noise is minimized in this recording, you can hear that the fans were jazzed.  We were only a small fraction of the 100,000 people that were yelling and screaming, and all psyched up.",

      "review_text": "Summer 89' Just watched the Buffalo DVD no extras but I think it is the best sounding release to date. I've been a fan of the Alpine DVD. The great thing about both of them is it really shows how much fun the Boys especially Jerry were having that summer. This is probably the best summer tour of the decade sorry 85' Almost every show in July is smoking. These 2 are no exception. Amzing Shakedown Ripping Jack Straw West LA one of my Fav was nice to. Victim odly placed in the first set but still was apparent that this was going to be a hell of a song.  Strong BEW and QJ is hot up there with RFK 90' And Greek 88' which is IMHO the best. The Bird Song to close the first set was a pretty Good Indicator that a Dark Star bustout was looming. They had really started to regain there footing in deep exploritory Jazzy modes that for as good as they played were just not their for most of the decade. If there was any doubt after the 1st set that this was going to be monster China Rider oblitarated it. High powered well played Phill just thunders away. Samson kicks the energy level Bobs vocals are top notch. Great Guitar and organ work from Garcia and Brent. Built to Last seldom played and rarer still in the 2nd set was a nice choice i really love this song. Truckin' gets things moving again. Bobby's vocals again are excellent and the music is fantastic. Post Drums is really strong. The Gimmie Some Lovin Goin Down the Road are both really good Throwing stones is done well with an etremley powerful jam and lots of energy from Bob. NFA is awsome really heavy drums and organ. Garcia really goes all out for the NY crowd. Brokedown encore to wrap things up. Expectations are high for the next night.",

Then I clicked my way over here to read almost verbatim what I just wrote: The 7-4-89 video release is IMHO the best performance the Dead has issued in video format (of the newest View from the Vault releases, etc...) Along with the Downhill from Here video, these two releases really do show Jerry (and band) having a great time during these shows. The Bertha from 7-4-89 is AWESOME.

Why does anybody actually reserve the right to review a Grateful Dead show...Who really cares what your opinion is and if you didnt have a great experience for whatever reason keep your bitchin to yourself...There's a ton of people out there who only saw one or two shows with Jerry anyway. This might be someones actual favorite show...Lets try not to rain on anyones parade, just discuss your personal experiences and leave Jerry and the Boys' efforts alone...\nHow's that for a review??",

Levels are more balanced, instrument separation is good, and sound quality is better overall.\n\nCheck it out: http://tinyurl.com/n9tzofa\nPreview: http://preview.tinyurl.com/n9tzofa",

I vividly remember the moment where I stopped dancing and just listened with my jaw on the floor. He played some of the most wailing licks that I've ever heard.  Blown away!",

      "review_text": "Greetings from Asbury Park This was my first show, and it was unbelievable, I was 17 and this night, I was introduced to a whole new world that I would forever call home from that day forward.  Before the show on the way in, I was on the left of the stage making my way down to our seats, a few rows back from the top of the wall that overlooked the field.  But somehow there was a huge surge of people n a push and I was forced down against the wall and eventually had to jump down, off the wall, like 20 feet and THEN dodge the security guards who were tackling people n throwing them out of the show.  So WE ALL JUMPED, and deked the guards and made our way dead center of the floor..... I danced all night in awe that a band could possess a power like they did.  On the way home, in my 1979 Toyota Corolla, in a scene out of the Griswold's, in VACATION, the movie, I was driving and eventually the whole car was asleep on the turnpike, The next thing I knew, was I was dreaming with my head against the window and sparks flying up off the side of my car door as I grinded against the guardrail.... Miraculously I gained control off the car, but my friend in the back slammed his head through the window, shattering it, but he was fine.  The police were right behind us and let me go even after they saw open beer in the car and us being 17 only.  All they kept asking for was the Cocaine...\"Where's the cocaine, you have any cocaine....????\"  Truly bizarre.\n   Anyway , that was my first Dead show, and all I could think as I finally lay my head on the pillow, was..............Man, I can't WAIT for the next show, cause there is nothing in the world, Like a GRATEFUL DEAD SHOW  !!!!",
