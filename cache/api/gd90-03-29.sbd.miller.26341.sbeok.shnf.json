      "review_text": "Hello Branford!!! This was effectively my last show. Though I saw quite a few shows after March 29, 1990, nothing topped this one. The legend was that Branford Marsalis had not even heard The Dead before getting on stage with them that night. The next day, he allegedly went to Tower Records and purchased the entire GD catalogue. From Branford's first peeps during \"Birdsong\" to the crazy, up and down, second set scale-runnings with Jerry and Brent and twisted jazz that eventually found its way onto \"Infrared Roses,\" there was an energy and genuine excitement present that simply wasn't there in future shows with Branford. This show was about exploration. Jerry was on the mark. Arguably the farthest-out rendition of \"Dark Star\" of the later years. Probably the sexiest \"Estimated Prophet\" too. The entire band rose to the challenge, and then raised the bar. Bottom Line: Killer '90's Dead.",

      "review_text": "Just exactly perfect... This is probably my favorite latter-day Dead show. As someone who's never seen the Dead back when they were still Grateful, unfortunately, my opinion is based solely on the performance. Sure, personal taste comes into play, but I try to be objective here. However, a show with Branford Marsalis and a killer setlist like this certainly gives it an advantage going in.\n\nBut it's not just because of these things that it's great, because as we all know, great setlists don't mean much if the songs aren't performed well. Here they're not just performed well, but near flawless. Jerry pours his heart out into every song, through his voice and his guitar.\n\nI honestly can't pick a highlight, as the whole show is amazing straight through. Branford Marsalis really gels with the band here, turning Bird Song, Eyes, and Dark Star into entirely unique compositions, worthy of repeat listens. Over the years I've listened to this show dozens of times, and it never ceases to amaze me how new details and intricacies reveal themselves to me with each new listen.\n\nWith so many shows up here on the Archive, it can be difficult to really spend time with one show for a few days. This one is well worth knowing by heart.\n\nImpeccable sound as always from Charlie.",

They are playing like an ensemble, instead of a bunch of aging druggies going through the motions.  Breaks my heart to say that, but it's what they evolved into.\n\nBob's singing is more restrained that usual.  At some point, he got a theatrical, over-the-top style which I don't care for.  But not so much in this show.\n\nBrent's keyboard playing is also ON (I can do without his song, but that's ok).  Shows a lot more range than his usual schtick.\n\nI don't think there are any weak points.  The sound quality of the recording is also very good.",

If the Dead ever experienced a \"comeback\" period, I'd say 1989-1990 was it. The band actually spent time rehearsing for shows, their equipment was boss, and they started having genuine fun with the music again. I'm not a big fan of the MIDI years, but at least they were doing some really creative stuff with their effects racks during these tours (not just noodling away during Space, or adding godawful horns to Ramble On Rose). Brent and Jerry were especially hot during '89-'90.\n\nI agree; this show is the Barton Hall of the Brent era.",

Like most of their stuff from this era, \"Knockin'\" doesn't need two drummers - it ain't no \"(The) Eleven\".\n\nKiller version though (and overall a very good if not great show) - better than the one on 'Crimson, White and Indigo' and that one's pretty good too.\n\nOverall good show = 4 stars (i.e. not a 5 star 'Live/Dead').",

Which one is the best, is something that can be debated forever.  I think they are all great, with incredible moments in each of those shows, that could make each one \"better\" than the other,(although i would put the LA show last no matter what), I think being at the show makes the most difference if you were lucky to catch one.\n\n3-29-90:  I know if you were there, nothing would compare to it.  Probably the most pleasureable Eyes of the World to listen to at anytime, the first time together and just how good it all sounds is why i think people rate this as number 1.  I have it ranked at 2,for only 1 (well maybe 2) reason which will be stated below.\n\n12-31-90:  love the NFA>eyes 2nd set opener, but space>other one>wharf rat, wow is all I can say to that madness. I rank this at 3.\n\n9-10-91:My number 1 branford show, because he played the whole show and I had the best seats in the house (SECTION 75, ROW L SEAT 3, look it up). The fact he played the whole show sets this one apart from the others by a hair. The first set,  from shakedown to deal, is incredible IMO. By far, the most powerful 1st set I ever heard, even if it was only 7 songs. The 2nd set wasn't filled with thier greatest versions of these songs other than Standing on the moon, but the slipknot was out of this world and the jam from estimated to dark star was pretty awesome in its own right.  \n\nThe LA show:  I have only listened to this show once, and I wasn't even impressed with the scarlet>fire, so this is a solid 4th place for me.\n\nI know my seats have made me biased, because the sound I heard at MSG was and still is, mind-boggeling. It was as though you could SEE the music coming from the stage (and no, I was fairly sober this night as this was the 6th of the 7 shows I caught of this tour). This is just my opinion, but I am glad that all these shows happened, because I love it all!!!!!",
