I remember dancing up a storm during the first set and noticing several times that the dude behind me was looking at me like I was an idiot.  After the set closed, he said, loudly, for me (and others around me) to hear, \"that was the worst set ever.\"  I still can't get over that.  I thought it was pretty solid, with an unusual Box of Rain opener and a good Jack Straw -- the set might have bogged down a bit after that but nothing out of the ordinary.  I thought it was pretty good.  Second set had tons of energy, with Bruce; even Picasso Moon was cool, and Days Between was one of the best I ever saw.",

And they did.  I remember Deal ending the first set really well, and the second set hitting some good jams.  And of course, the Brokedown encore was really nice.  A separate note is that stadium shows just aren't very good.  They're just too big and chaotic.  But anyway, these summer '94 shows were so-so.  But when the Dead hit the fall shows at Madison Square Garden, they were a difefrent band, and played a hell of a lot better.  Instead of downloading either 8/3 or 8/4 of '94, go straight to 10/1, 10/13, 10/14, and 10/17.",

Perhaps my view was altered by the fact that the prior night (8/03) was a show that I almost walked out on during the pre drums. This night however had a decent setlist and for the most part average to better playing from the band. I remember the Box/Jack openers being pretty good as well as the closing Deal (although not as good as the Nassau Deal on 3/27/94). The 2nd set with Hornsby featured China/Rider and Playin/UJB in the same set which selection wise alone blow away the previous nights pre drums debacle. Best of the 4 or 5 shows I saw in the summer of 1994 but that in itself isn't saying much.",

His playing was sloppy and weak. I remember seeing Weir on the big monitors with a unhappy look on his face I imagine was there because Jerry was fucked up.\nAnd the encore of Brokedown Palace when Jerry was laughing and smiling when his playing wasn't something to smile about.

      "review_text": "last show I hadn't seen the Dead for a couple of years by this point... probably not since 1992.  I took a friend with me who had never seen the band.  We walked in while Traffic was playing.  I had no idea that they were opening, so it was a nice surprise.  Of course, like always, they killed it.  By contrast, it was a let down once the Dead started playing.  It wasn't that Jerry was flubbing a lot; the ideas were there, and the technique wasn't worse than usual, let's say.  But JJG wasn't a master technician, even at his best (e.g., 8/13/75... even in that great version of KSM, he loses where he is for a few seconds).  What he was was an unbelievably soulful performer, with the ability to move your very being with a single note or two.  He was also a presence.  Hard to describe that.  I'm pretty sure that Jerry had shot smack before this particular show.  Again, the ideas were there... the notes were basically there... but there was really no feeling.  That's what Deadheads paid for: feeling.  So, it was a bit of a waste of time and money.  At the time, I said to my friend, \"I don't know what happened to these guys.  They're so much worse than they were just a couple of years ago.\"  My friend liked the show anyway, but probably more because the GD's shows were kind of a phenomenon... and, generally, newbies either thought the crowd was a crazy cult or the most devoted rock fans on Earth.  I tend to go with the latter belief; we were just totally devoted to that music, because it gave us so much that we felt we had to give back to the band (and vice versa... thus, the story of \"Grateful Dead\").\n\nBut it really was a lackluster show... not even bad, but dull.  And sometimes dull can be worse than bad.  I'd have to say that it was the worst show I saw since 1988.  And, unfortunately, it was also the LAST show I saw.  One year later, Jerry was dead.  I wish that hadn't been the last but, you know, given where he was at by that point, another show could've even been worse.",

I don't love this AUD recording and likely will never revisit this one. Garcia also on the whole uneven.\n\nStill, the first set highlights are - no surprise - So Many Roads and Eternity. God help me with that Childhood's End. Oh, and love the Deal closer. \"Go Jerry!\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Post-set crowd conversation reality-check: \"That's was great! (Inaudible... something about letting the aisle clear.) It was OK....\"\u00a0\n\nMuch better second set. Hornsby joins for the whole set, on accordion, and it's a whopper at nearly two hours. The final set of Su94 and you get a China-Rider, PITB->UJB, a monster Drumz, Days Between, and feel good NFA vibes to send you home. Brokedown Palace encores.\u00a0\n\nSome more (post-show) crowd banter:\n\n\"What a summer... good way to end it, too.\"\n\"Great show... like a different band from last night..\"",

      "review_text": "Grateful to Be There! WOW!  What a concert - I was lucky, very lucky, to be the recipient of 5 second row seats on the \"Jerry Side\" at this fabulous concert.  A friend of mine was able to \"sneak\" in a mini-digital recorder with finger length mini-microphones (which he wore on the underside of his baseball cap). Eventually my friends and I who were there got copies from his recording of the concert, but alas, over the years, the copies were lost as was the original.  However, here it is on the Internet Archive!   My favorite number that they did was \"Deal\" - to me, it was their best.  But, I would not throw out the baby with the bath water- the rest of the concert was amazing.  BTW, the remnants of Traffic opened which was a great set as well!  I can now relive that concert - and with great sound quality!  Hats off to the contributor!  Keep on truckin'!",

Also, as far as I know and have ever heard he never shot smack. Not that he didn\u2019t use it though. This show, a solid 2 star affair. ",

      "review_text": "painful Sorry I was drunk the last review and rambling, my bad. Pay no attention to that crazy grumpy man. SMILE SMILE SMILE!! This show was painful though.  Jerry really just wanted to go scuba diving and play on the couch with Grisman.  He had earned it and we wouldn't let him-- the fans, the band, the organization, the music business, all of it.  Hearing these last 2 years now, the weird eerie haunting notes he would seemingly get lost in were like an SOS.  \"This is how interested I am in the Grateful Dead now. Please send help\".  Absolutely some gems though, and I'm finding them in fall '94, which were the first non sold out shows in a decade or more.  10/1 is a grand tour of the solar system and 10/5 is utterly intergalactic. Like for one night it was Spring 90 again. ",
