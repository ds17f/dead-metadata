The sound quality is obviously 5 stars, easily. However there are parts of this show that seem to drag to me. The Help->Slip is awesome, kicking interesting and full of energy but the Franklins...I have tried, listened as closely as I know how...imho it is boring.  The BE Women is great but the night before has it beat. The Peggy-O is virtually above reproach, gorgeous. Sunrise--maybe if this wasn't there thing could be different but that kills the set for me.  TMNS is great and tight but by the time it comes around my hands are in my pockets. Bertha->Good Lovin smokes and Ship of Fools, while a wonderful song, squashes the energy from the 1st two songs. Imo, they never are able to bring it back up after this. The rest of the show is very tight, well played, but in comparison with many many other shows bores me. Seems like cruise control. 5/4 5/5 5/8 5/11 5/15 5/25 all stand out more for me. 2/26/77 4/23/77-period shows with H>S>F that kill this one...6/19/76 10/11/77 also. Dont take this review wrong.

And all the while, my 3 friends, who arn't heads, standing in the shadows watching me the entire time. One thing I can say, one can play music VERY loud in the Michigan woods. My friends came out of the shadows, scaring the shit out of me, while laughing thier asses off. They just didn't understand.\n  Interesting that very few comments about Music, which to me is the highlight of the show, and the best I have ever heard. Jerry is just crazy jamming.

This show is perfect. Keith isn't blackout wasted and is hitting his key solos with perfection. Bobby actually hits some interesting riffs, specifically in Bertha. Donna isn't overwhelming Bobby or Jerry vocally. Phil is experimenting like never before on the fretless. THESE ARE THE MOST INTENSE PHIL BOMBS ON THE DEADS ENTIRE CAREER.\n\nWithout spelling out the whole setlist which is all amazing (except for Sunrise, but that goes without saying, and was expected in 77') i'll point out the highlights.\n\nHelp>Slip!>Franklin's opener is quite a treat with the band in high vocal form and no slacker moments in the slipknot jam. Phil and Bobby seem to have a mutual understanding of what needs to happen in this. \n\nOther set 1 topper seems to be Big River which is spectacular. Each instrument is relevant and no one is \"soloing\", everyone is cooperating.\n\nMany reviewers have mentioned Music Never Stopped as being great here. Again we get some outrageous Phil bombs with  a faster, more intense solo than used to from Jerry in this song. I almost felt twinges of the guitar energy displayed in numbers like the Eleven from 1969 fillmore shows. Never would Garcia play guitar this sharply or intensly again.\n\nSecond set is magic time and dosn't nessesarilly follow the second set formula with a spectacular Ship of Fools, a musically brilliant Estimated (all three nites from this run have exelent estimateds), and a particularly emotional Comes a Time that beats 72' versions.\n\nBrilliant, sound is sublime, 5, band is at it's highest point, 5,\nall is good.",

Someone said (somewhere) the set list wasn't really important and if that's what you are looking for in a Dead concert then you've missed the point.  I disagree.....sort of. I never went looking for a specific group of songs. However, my preference for music sung by Jerry is unquestionable. I could listen to Loser, Eyes, Fire, or Franklin's Tower (to name a few) every night. I'm not looking for those songs, specifically, but it was so beautiful most every time I heard one of them when he was at his best. As good as Buffalo was, it's missing a song or two that I'd of liked to have heard within the flow of this show. I know, some will say it's all a bunch of bullshit.

      "review_text": "Perfection When I first got this tape it quickly became a favorite and has remained so. I love shows that start hot out of the gate and this is a prime example. Tons of energy and everyone at the top of their game musically (except perhaps Keith who is nevertheless just fine). Everyone stands out at different moments. First you're hearing Jerry's incredible leads and that tone. Then you're noticing how loud and on Phil is. And the drummers are at the peak of complemnting each other and the musc, ever propulsive. Then Bob's guitar, also loud with great tone and well balanced, laying down the perfect counterpoint to Jerry's leads. I think a big part of this tape's (and this run's) reputation lies in its sound and it sounds incredible. The balance and seperation are just perfect, and this source sounds as good as any of the others to me. I love how loud the toms are. Phil was stil such a driving force. After '77 the rhythm section would rarely ever be this driving again.\n\nThe Dead were never about perfection, but to me this first set is as close to perfection as they got. Sure there is a minor lyric flub or two, but every solo, every transition, every vocal, every version of every song in the first set is near definitive (even Sunrise). Certainly my favorite Help Slip Franklins. Pair this set with the previous night's second and wow! Don't get me wrong this second set has its moments but isn't at the same level as the first overall.\n\nIts interesting that this run of shows came at such a difficult time in the band's career. Things with Keith and Donna were on the downslope. Jerry was overwhelmed with finishing the movie and had been recently introduced to the Persian which would ultimatly lead to his  musical and personal decline. Nervertheless, the boys pull out a run for the ages! The second set of Cornell through the end of this first set is my personal favorite stretch of Dead music. I probably reach for this show more than any other.",

One of my early impressions of the Grateful Dead back in 1974, When I first listened to some of their albums, was that they have the unique ability to hold a note without actually playing it. Listening to the '77 shows confirms that first impression.  \n\nAmong the standouts for me in this show are Not Fade Away and Sugar Magnolia. Played very differently and yet still Very fine.\n\nthe sound is excellent, the performance is excellent. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that it almost like a studio recording for quality.  \nExcept for Kieth the band is really on this night. Kieth, while still playing very, very good, seems to be coasting throught most of this show.  Maybe he was distacted by something that happened or a toothache or who the hell knows what, but he does not seem to be part of the group mind on this particular night.  Makes me wonder what this show would have been like if he was \"on\" too.  \n\nthere have been some comments about Sunrise, most sayint that they did not care for the song, and I cannot argue with that, but I think that the reviewer who said that it does not have a Grateful Dead groove is wrong. Sunrise is the Grateful Dead playing behind Donna Jean's solo.  No question about it, with the Grateful Dead the music plays the band and that is what you have here. IMHO\n\nGiving This a five for the quality of the sound and mixing.  And a 4.75 for the performance.",

But with all the hoopla surrounding that one specific date, it seems that many folks have blocked out the amazing music that surrounded that incredible musical experience. Case in point: the following night in Buffalo. The energy from the previous night is channeled into perhaps the best version of Help>Slip>Franklin\u2019s of the year. Gone is the meandering mellowness of 1976. This is the Dead at their finest. The boys are on fire. The transitions are spot on and Jerry\u2019s vocals and guitar work on Franklin\u2019s Tower are magnificent. My four favorite versions of this trifecta are One From The Vault, Beacon Theatre, 06/14/76, this version here and the beauty that is the opening sequence of Without A Net. \nThe rest of the first set is perfect Dead: Brown-Eyed Women shines with Americana and Jerry pours his heart into the solos. Bobby\u2019s clean slide work compliments Jerry\u2019s fiery guitar as the boys flow into a traditional Bobby Mexicali. Tennessee Jed follows and Jerry is on as always. I have a huge affection towards a well-played Big River. This one here\u2026well, just listen. Johnny Cash wrote it. Bobby sings it. But Jerry makes it his own. Take a listen after Keith\u2019s piano solo. Pure magic. This is vintage Garcia. Billy fills in with a beautiful flourish and we wind down into Peggy-O. Has there ever been a more beautiful Garcia tune? Vocals, guitar work, timing\u2026perfect. Jerry\u2019s first solo takes us far, far away and then gently brings us back. Tales of rejection and triumphant return entwine beautifully, while we, the listener, are reminded of a time when worry was closer to home. Why do we find this experience so emotional? Ask any deadhead and you will get a different answer. History combines with beauty. Why am I listening to a band that I only saw live once? Why do I feel an instant affinity to any person that I hear playing the boys? Well, the music lives on and hopefully I can forward some of the experience to all of you. That the music lives on and continues to gain listeners is a testament to the integrity of the band. The spark that was lit back in my formative years has grown and I hope that I have helped turn on a few friends along the way. I will just leave it at this: do those first notes of Eyes of the World always make you smile? No matter where you are or what you are doing? \n\u201cRight outside this lazy summer home\u2026.\u201d\nSunrise is standard as always, but my goodness\u2026The Music Never Stopped. This song was born in 1976, but the Band brought it to its height in 1977. If I were to pick my favorite Donna accompaniment, it would be the Music Never Stoppeds from 1976-1978 or the Wharf Rats from the same era. All else aside, this version is one of the best from 1977 and may be the best from the late 1970\u2019s. \nA beautiful Bertha begins the second set. Jerry, Bobby and Phil charge through and bring the first set magic right to the forefront. A predictable Good Lovin\u2019 flows into Ship of Fools. Jerry brings everything down, down, down only to launch into Estimated. This tune was still relatively new to the band having only been introduced during the Terrapin Station recording sessions. Any hesitancy the band may have had at the February Swing Auditorium show has now dissipated. Estimated is here to stay. Jerry\u2019s thwunky wah goads Phil right into The Other One. \nFor astute listeners, Jerry\u2019s signature 1977 \u201cgrowl\u201d can be heard in evolution throughout 1976. Swing Auditorium 1977 is really where the 1977 \u201cJerry growl\u201d takes over. Throughout 1976, Jerry\u2019s tone can be heard to flow in and out of the \u201csignature growl.\u201d Sometimes we hear him almost all the way there and then at other times we hear the individual beauty of 1976. An overlooked year indeed: a transition year. But if you catch yourself with an ear for the Dead, you will recognize 1976 right out of the gate. Such is the beauty of the Dead. When you know, you know.\nThe Other One is one of the Dead\u2019s primal tunes. Here we get a dark, yet fully satisfying version that flows into early Dead psychedelia while maintaining the feel of late 1970\u2019s Dead. Mickey and Billy intersperse a brief drum interval and then the band falls into Not Fade Away. The boys have been playing this tune since 1970 and are quite aware of where they can take it. The drums thunder as Jerry finds inexplicable note combinations and the band builds towards an inexorable crescendo, only to find all the instruments fade away\u2026 except Jerry. \nThe haunting notes of Comes a Time slowly emerge: a solo Jerry tune that was worked seamlessly into the Dead repertoire. Pure emotion. The end solo section is pristine. And then we come to every deadhead\u2019s favorite tune: Sugar Magnolia. I cannot say I ever liked this tune, but you become numb to it after a while.\nThe Dead were never known for playing the best encores. But honestly, I will take an Uncle John\u2019s Band encore any day. From a historical perspective: a fitting send-off to a brilliant three-night run. The Grateful goddamn Dead!",

      "review_text": "My First Show The first time I heard or heard of the Grateful Dead was the first time I got stoned, Summer 1975. I became aware of and locked in at Brown-Eyed Women and by the end of Morning Dew I was utterly convinced that my parents and everything they stood for were extinct. Dead were Done too, they said, Pig Pen was the end. I was buying sugar cubed over the counter a the record store, circulating boots from Felt Forum, Winterland and The great Hway (The Family Dog) Next I knew they were trucking' up to Buffalo, I was 15 and didn't have a drivers license but my cousin Bobby lived in Lockport so he came through with an extra to get a guy to drive us up From Cleveland. We got there late but you can't ever late to the future. Tie-dye twirling among kaleidoscopic lights, drenched in a deep gold budded smoky haze...the Women!!!  and Brown-Eyed Women locked me in again. 2nd set rolled just as I was coming' heavy on.. It lifted off Bertha>Good loving' settled back into Ship of Fools then a monster shot: Estimated Prophet Phil taking me inside out and sideways, Bobby straight ahead. California WAS the prophet on the burnin shores of my Cuyahoga river. Everything got hot, The other one and the other one and a half had me out of body, infused in the pores of war memorial.. then something happened near the end that may have saved some lives. The question: All that I want to know is are you kind? Brought me back in a sobering and sternly inquisitive way.. these compounds weren't toys, they were tools. I was deep in it, riding shotgun an hour or so into the ride home when the driver nodded in my direction, the wheel coming with, it jerked and shook me, pounding my back into door with a pretty good sized kid coming in on me shoulder to knee. It was probably a 70 mph situation, on a 2 lane each way with embankments over the side. I saw it all, every particle..I felt it come, utter calm. Not nonchalant but ultra clean in the lean behind left hand clasp of the wheel while the right knew where to catch and grab his collar  and shake with sufficient force to bring him back into the now, where he knew to get off the gas but not so much to rattle and over react.. then we synchronized our way back into place, headed for the next coffee stop.. got a nod and \"right on, man\" from the HS Senior for stepping up. Good deal, Great Show, I highly recommend it.",

      "review_text": "Seems like yesterday... Was enjoying spring time in Georgia, when a buddy going to Cornell said, \"come on up for the Dead.  We can hit Barton Hall and then Buffalo.\"  I gave the very lame, \"but I have a huge paper due the Wednesday after the shows, a and a huge test on the Friday after the shows.\"  We both had a good laugh and I booked a flight to Ithaca with a return to Atlanta the night of the 10th.  Aside from great shows, seeing a handful of friends that stayed north for schools was a great morale boost to carry me through my own finals that were coming up in June.   And yes, I did just fine on my test and paper.  But that's not why I'm typing away today.  Not at all.... I'm here to tell you a story of two remarkable shows...  Remarkably well played, and remarkably different.   \n\nObviously, I was blown away by 5/8....   everyone was.....   But, the next night in Buffalo.... WOW!!!  I may have been the only one in my group saying it, but I liked Buffalo more than Cornell....   From start to finish, all great stuff.  The best versions of some songs?  Not really sure as I've heard some comparable Help/Slip/Franklin as well as some stand-alone Franklin's that are smoking.   And I've heard some mighty fine TMNS and Peggy-O's and Bertha's, etc., etc.   But from the opening chord of Help, to the UJB encore, every note was purposeful [thank you tripping balls guy behind me at the first night of RFK '86 for that descriptive].    \n\nAll my buddies thought I was nuts...  After all, 5/8/77 could be the greatest Morning Dew- -certainly my favorite by a long way.  And that Scarlet>Fire- -especially the jam and the Fire.... OMG!!!  Jerry's lead cascading and cascading in Fire still gives me shivers when I think back to that night.....   \n\nBut almost 40 years later, I still think Buffalo stands the test of time as well as any show the Dead ever played.  Unlike Cornell where I'll sometimes skip a tune to get to a highlight, I have never skipped a tune when streaming 5/9/77.   As that smiling, tripping dude said.... every note was purposeful.\n\nSo let the debate continue.... what was the greatest show in that merry month of May 1977?   No matter your answer, you can't be wrong.....\n\nBTW- - if you want another tale of two remarkably well played yet remarkably different shows, fast forward 3 years to spring 1980.  Senior year of college for me.  Trucked west from Atlanta to Birmingham on 4/28.  Great little show capped by a hot GDTRFB encore.   Then back to Atlanta for the Fox Theater on 4/29.  A proletariat song list compared to the night before.  But just as then, and notwithstanding what the folks I trucked to Birmingham say, from start to finish I still prefer the Atlanta show.   Oh well.... opinions.... as Charles Durning said in Home for the Holidays, \"Opinions are like assholes.   Everybody has one and everybody thinks the other guy's stinks.\"  :)\n\nOn that note....   back to work I must go.....  Have a grateful day....   and keep the music and vibe alive!!",
