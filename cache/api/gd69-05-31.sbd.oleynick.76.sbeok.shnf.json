DB didnt even have a setlist for this show when i got it.\n  It seems he was a fixture at Hepurn Heights back in the day and everyonce in awhile Jerry would poke his head up out of the basement for a smoke and some conversation. After awhile he started slipping this guy some tapes. And this was one of them.  My friend was surprised to learn that Jerry DID listen to his own shows, and just plain old raved about some of them. \n   Anyway it was one of his favorites too :))\n\n\n    Charlie if your out there tell us the whole story!!\n\n(~)}] \n\n  Too much of everything, is just ENOUGH!",

This is one of the best Dark Stars -- and arguably the very best -- of 1969.\n\nFor what it's worth, the long and mellow Friend of Mine, the Lovelight, the Hurts Me Too (!) and the Baby Blue are also magnificent.  Even the Bid You Goodnite is sung with more than the usual feeling.\n\nPlenty of great quotes and banter throughout but my favorite is Jerry's comment after \"Bid You Goodnite\":  \"That's your groove.\"",

May 2010 This is the first time I've written a review, although I've been enjoying the Dead's music available on IA for many years.\nI'm from London, England and I don't usually feel the need to comment on the recordings and performances, but I felt moved to say that the singing and playing on \"He was A Friend Of Mine\" is just very, very special for me. Jerry's playing on this song is exquisite, so light and gentle : a glorious experience for me!\n\nThank you to all those who've made possible this wonderful archive of the Dead's music.",

      "review_text": "This is the captain speaking, prepare the rocket fuel for the faster than light drive... An Acid Test reunion show. Never trust a prankster...\n\nTIFTOO rages. A week of great Lovelights(see 5/23, 5/24 in particular, and this one). These 3 versions often explode into intense jams, including some Caution-style jams reminiscent of the 4/22/69 Lovelight. \n\nOthers have highlighted the He Was A Friend Of Mine - they seemed to be playing extended versions of the song around this time with some sweet, mellow jams. I wonder if the emotion of this version was due to it being played in honor of a Prankster who was conspicuously absent from the evening's events - Neal Cassady. \n\nMid to late 69 is an interesting period for Dark\nStar with some wonderful versions. It seems as if they have reached the peak maturity of the Live/Dead form and are starting to really traverse new territory and explore the open potential of the song. As the year progresses we hear them weaving in thematic jams that would lead into the 70s.\n\nCosmic Charlie is just a snippet but it's a soothing send off.",

      "review_text": "'Everything promised, is delivered to you' This is a great show. I always love the Oregon shows, and this one is no different. Laid back, fun, and they always seem so relaxed and happy. So thankful to have found this entertaining gem.\n Hard to Handle starts off strong, with the boys really in their prime. Cold Rain and Snow was still played at breakneck speed, and there follows some wonderful banter into a Yellow Dog Story. I love this period. Young, confident, and still surging headlong into the unknown. They're so playful, and you really get the campus vibe circa 1969. Just ten weeks before Woodstock, Green Grass feels perfect and is just a hoot! Going into MAMU they're just begining to pour the fuel on. Controlled chaos!\n It's not controlled for long Cryptical > Drums > TOO > Reprise. That Cowboy Neal lyric is fierce. Top of the World is great, and Hurts Me Too is making the paint drip off my walls. Blistering. Love that solo. The intro to Baby Blue is unique, and Jerry just shines on this version. I agree with the other reviews, these may be some of the finest versions of Hurts Me Too, Baby Blue & He Was A Friend of Mine ever! Epic. Speaking of epic, Lovelight. Wow, grate raps. Like a cherry on top, Dark Star. But wait, Doin' That Rag burns, even if clipped, and the Charlie fade out just leaves me smiling.\n Listen to it, stream it, or download it. There's no dud in the whole lot. With the Pranksters present, it's like everyone has to elevate their game. Summer of '69 ? 5 star all the way !  \n\n'There's more of us than them'",

      "review_text": "UNEVEN - BUT BRILLIANT MOMENTS  OK - so yesterday I listened to the Springer's Inn concert from the previous night (and reviewed it).  This here Saturday night show from McArthur Court is MUCH BETTER.  It has some really rough / badly performed or sung songs at the beginning and here and there throughout, but the brilliant / buoyant moments lift this show to five stars (IMHO).  I'll just touch on the high points.  \"Me and My Uncle\" is good and solid. \"The Other One\" is very good - with some needless repetition from Garcia on guitar licks here and there - but the brilliance outshines the few awkward moments.  \"Sitting On Top of the World\" is just great all around, and \"He was a Friend of Mine\" has quite a bit of fantastic and beautiful guitar from Jerry!!!  The \"Dark Star\" is MUCH BETTER than the previous night - it is really good (not anywhere near my favorite - but I've never heard a \"Dark Star\" that wasn't at least good or that I didn't like at all). This \"Dark Star\" is still close to the classic LIVE DEAD version - and there is that guitar-lick-repetition problem Garcia got into during this period - but it is more tasteful here somehow in the way repetitions bloom into brilliance ... and the surprising / creative / awesome parts (with the entire group engaged) are clearly inspired. \"Doin' That Rag\" (a song I initially disliked on AOXOMOXOA) ALMOST makes it here - Jerry's singing is still very awkward - but he comes closer to pulling it off.  I can now see that the chords and the lyrics are better than I thought in 1969 (when I was turning eleven and we bought this album and just didn't get it).  I'm glad \"Cosmic Charlie\" cuts off - they butchered the vocals the night before.  I'm guessing \"Lovelight\" is at least super solid (I didn't have time to listen).\n\nA followup to my comments on Springer's Inn last night. Even though \"St. Stephen\" and a couple other songs were FANTASTIC on AOXOMOXOA, that album caused me to reject the Grateful Dead for awhile (until I heard LIVE DEAD).  Jerry Garcia was really struggling as a singer - and i had really loved his voice on the first two albums.  On AOXOMOXOA Jerry tried to do too much - and didn't quite make it.  I was still very young and a couple years away from collecting bootlegs and witnessing concerts.  I think Jerry was really stretching himself in the songs he was trying to sing (like \"Doing That Rag\" and other songs) - but he just couldn't do it.  The entire band could't always sing at all well together - though when they did (\"St. Stephen\" and some other songs) - they were great!!!  I thought they all pulled off vocals very well in 1968 with ANTHEM OF THE SUN.  A lot of early fans got off the bus at this time with these vocal problems.  Jerry's voice evolved - and by the early 1970s he was singing much better (even on the next two 1970 studio albums).  The other thing that turned me off is that my beloved Pigpen did not have a single song or even a credit on AOXOMOXOA.  You could see Pigpen in the picture on the back of AOXOMOXOA, but his credits listed only \"Pigpen\" (no instruments or vocals).  I WAS FURIOUS!!!  Why did we get so much terrible material or so badly sung songs (\"What's Become of the Baby\" & \"Rosemary\" & \"Doin' That Rag\" & even \"Cosmic Charlie\") ... and not employ Pigpen to really sing some great songs???  All of that changed, of course. with LIVE DEAD and the next few albums. Jerry returned to being a beautiful (yet different) singer, the band got much better at harmonies. And the subsequent songs were much better, and merely good songs from AOXOMOXOA like \"China Cat Sunflower\" turned our to be PHENOMENAL in concert ... and I got right back on the bus!!!  \n\nExcuse me for this silly rant, a la 'Portrait of a Deadhead as a Young Kid in 1969' ... But hopefully my silly commentary provides a glimpse into 1969 - an essential and pivotal year - but also a \"muddled masterpiece\" era if ever there were one. ",
