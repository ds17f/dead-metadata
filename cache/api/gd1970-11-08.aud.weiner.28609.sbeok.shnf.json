The electric set starts off with a bang, with a superb Morning Dew.  The masterpiece, however, is the Truckin through the Good Lovin.  They're all playing so hard on these jams.  The Main Ten comes out of a some crazy space jams in Dark Star, and winds its way around into a bouncing Dancin' Jam before Billy and Mickey hammer them into the song.  Kick ass jamming on this Dancin.  One of the best from this year.  Check out how hard they're playing on this Not Fade Away.  \nKiller show.  Finally in decent quality.",

Last acoustic set until 1980, final Operator, final Little Susie, final acoustic Uncle John, and the electric set is chock full of oddball stuff, and the melding of tunes not usually played together.

Well steal my face and call me Bozo, this show just made an AUD tape lover outta me!!\nI had seen this show mentioned around for years on the boards, and of course it's high up on the Deadbase survey list for 1970 as well. But hey, who has time for AUD shows when there's so much SBD to grab?? (he said foolishly). After reading the reviews of this new remaster from the Port Chester folks, the old Dr. decided to take the plunge and DL this monster.\nSo I load up Set One in my WAV player and click on\nFOTD. I was stunned! Speechless! The clarity of the vocals and acoustic guitars is amazing. I would have never believed an AUD from 1970 could sound this good. Okay, so maybe not quite up to the Holy Grail of 8/6/71, but close. REAL close. A big hats off and a pass of the pipe to the Port Chester group. But of course it helps to have a great source recording to start with - which this is.\nThe acoustic set features some fairly rare items - a slower El Paso, a beautiful Rosalie, and an even rarer Operator. The FOTD and Uncle John are stellar, and the Ripple really sweet. Well that's about the whole set isn't it - hell they're ALL good here. The band is in a good mood and it comes through in the singing.\nSet Two finds them trying out some different material, since no doubt they played almost everything they knew the previous 4 nights here. Kind of a laid back set if you can dig it, with lots of Garcia doing bluesy jams in the middle section - which is mostly instrumental. The Morning Dew is a real standout though, very strong. And the rare Baby Blue make this a very enjoyable set overall.\nOkay, put on your space helmets Cadets, and get ready to obtain orbit, cause the last set is not of this world!!\nA great Truckin (still a new song here) kicks it off, and then a seamless segue into Dark Star. First, some nice spacy jamming with Jerry offering all 64 Crayola colors in an ever-changing sound collage that's on the mellow side. Then after the verse - look out!! They go immediately into a long Feedback-like weirdness section, led mostly by Mickey and Bill on percussion FX. At the beginning during the Gong jam, someone in the audience contributes some bird calls - which temporarily breaks the spell and Bobby jokingly admonishes the crowd to \"be serious\". Priceless!!\nWarning - this Dark Star is a bit harsh if you're not into electronic effects. Very similar to the Caution>Feedback jam of the 9/20/70 show. But I like it, call me a freak. You'll find it hard to believe this is the same band that played Little Susie an hour ago!!  Finally Phil and Jerry enter the fray, and morph the jam into a fine early Main Ten (read Playin) jam. And the Dancin is just over the top, with Jerry delivering some scorching leads.\nThe rest of the show is so hot it's beyond description. Suffice to say that Pigpen brings it all down to earth with one of the best Good Lovins of the year. Those lucky few who were at this show really got their money's worth, and probably their lives changed as well!!\nThis one went right to the top and rang the bell for me. A Top Ten for sure, with the acoustic set, a fine shining example of what the Dead could do in 1970 when the force was with them. \nSuggestion - put this AUD show on a good stereo, tweak your EQ a little, esp. the bass. Turn out the lights - no ALL the lights. Turn on your surround sound and light up a bowl of Cheerios. I guarantee that by the 3rd or 4th song - you'll feel like you're IN the audience!! A great experience and a must have show for fans of this period. \ncheers,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

In New York City we had John Zacherle on WNEW-FM, who loved the Dead. Most of you are probably familiar with his band intro of 2-14-70 at the Fillmore East. Anyway, on his late night radio shows, he'd occasionally sneak in some bootleg Dead songs. This became so common, that I'd sit around waiting to hit the \"record\" switch on my trusty reel-to-reel to acquire some of those tasty treats. He would never tell you any dates or anything, just blow you away with the cool stash he had access to. Well, since late '70, when he played and I recorded this Morning Dew, I've been trying to locate it's date and source. 36 years. Turns out the copy I had was a Marty Weinberg copy. This one is SO MUCH BETTER!! This site is a treasure\n  To me, this is THE Dew. I know everyone has their favorite, but this is mine. Jerry's guitar tone, his phrasing, his volume control are sheer beauty. The solos are staggering, and the building intensity near the end of the song, when Billy and Mickey kick the beat into double time - that's just magic. The chord changes right there are unique to this version too. Of all the Dews I've listened to in my 57 years and thousands of hours of tapes, I've never heard another played like this.\n  As for the rest of the show, it's like this : GET IT. Besides the Dew, you need this show (Ken and Judy Lee version) because : The recording is so clean; look at the rarity of the set list; the energy in the performances; disc 4 has Jerry on Pedal Steel with The New Riders, how cool is that? If you ever witnessed him with them, you know what I'm saying. Great show, great audience recording.\n  A big Thank You to the Archive, to Ken and Judy Lee, and to the Port Chester Project for preserving history.

I even went as far as downloading shows from 77. I now make this pronouncement - The Grateful Dead are the present day Avatars of our time. All they bring is Joy and Light to all who are receptive enough. I even figured out that Weir's voice is AMAZING!! (will never like the chuck berry crap filler).\nSorry to rant but I had to.

There's not much left to say after all the other reviews, but I MUST single out the INCREDIBLE \"Dark Star\" > \"The Main Ten\" sequence.\n\nThis is my favorite \"Dark Star\" of all: just the right length and full of outerspace weirdness.  This reading of \"The Main Ten\" is absolutely spine-tingling; it sounds like the band is channeling some other world.  You just GOTTA hear this, gang!!\n\nVery nice AUD recording, capturing an astounding evening of music!!",

I was fortunate enough to be at every show during this run at the Capitol. \nI remember that there was a bomb threat called in and the fire marshal got on stage and told us that we all had to leave so that they could search the building. After the search they had no choice but to let everyone in. The theater was packed to the rafters. I remember Garcia and Weir saying we know that you're in here (referring to the person that called in the scare ) and they thanked the person. \n\nThe exit doors on the fire escape were open and we were dancing out in the alley of the theater and on the fire escape.\n\nThese shows were simply the greatest experience a person could hope for. It was a four day party. At the time I couldn't imagine it ever ending. The music was insane and the boys were just having a ball.\n\nI had this show on a Maxell tape for years and ultimately lost it. I was so happy to find it here on the Archives site.\n\nI have loved the Dead since I first saw them on 2-14-70(hence the user name)although I was hooked on Anthem, Aoxomoxoa and Live Dead before I ever saw them. Nothing in my life has ever touched the experiences I had at Dead shows(except for the births of my daugters).\n\nThese shows on the Archives web site whether Audience tapes or sound boards are like mana from heaven and should be cherished. Nothing will ever come around again that can compare to the total package that a Dead show could offer.\n\nFor sure there were nights that didn't hit the heights but all in all there was no place I would rather have been than at a Grateful Dead concert.\n\nI will always remember the joy and exceptional vibe that came with a show.\n\nI don't miss them because they are right here on the Archives site.\n\nGod bless the people that make this happen.\n\nAs for a rating of this show, for pure entertainment I give it a 10 but since 5 is all there is so be it. 5 it is.",

First, I have to say it is so encouraging to see other Heads who agree with what I have always thought, that this is the finest Morning Dew (and one of Jerry's finest guitar solos, period!) that the Dead ever performed. One of the great shows, maybe even my favorite to listen to given the vibe, energy, song selection, etc. \n\nNow since the late 70's I have had a cassette copy of much of this show that is a far superior recording.  It is a stereo audience that was dubbed from a reel to reel copy that I was told was a first gen copy, making mine a second gen. The highs and lows are vastly superior to any other copy I have heard circulating.  The only problems are that there are many cuts and glurps in the recording, it seems the taper stopped and started his rig after every song, (Baby Blue is particularly butchered) and it completely runs out at the beginning of Dancin', and is only the electric set (it starts about a minute into Morning Dew). Also, there is hilarious audience bantor throughout.  Despite the flaws, I think the recording is a gem because it TRULY feels like you are in the room when you listen to it. Has anyone else come across this version? If it has not circulated, I will try and post on the Dime to get it out there.",

First set acoustic, from what I gather, followed by the New Riders, then two complete electric GD sets. This is Ned's second show. As with his first, a few nights prior (11/5), his sit-in is this show's highlight. Must-listen: Dark Star->The Main Ten->Dancin'. It's the last Main Ten- sort of proto-Playing- and the Dancin' features an awesome Tighten Up jam. Also, like the previous show, it's hard to find/hear Ned. \"In 1970/1971, because of PA input limitations and/or whoever was mixing, it is hard for him to be heard. But there was no conscious effort to be absent, and not recorded.\" This of course changes in 74.

I am not always a big fan of El Paso, but this acoustic version is off the charts followed immediately by a rare and quality Operator from Pig Pen.  In general the aud source really works of the acoustic set - you can easily imagine yourself sitting in the 10th row along with a couple hundred friends.  The second set song selection is one of a kind with all those classic early rock and roll tunes.  They had already done Wake Up Little Susie in the first set and at the end Weir shouts out for the crowd to go back to the 1950s in a complaint for them to settle down with all the shouting of song requests.  This foreshadows the second set list where they uncork their own one of kind tribute to their early rock n roll heroes.  They get on a roll and just go for it.  If this is not your thing, hold on tight for the third set that is a high tempo electric romp that sends the audience into a frenzy.  It is so rare to get a great aud source for a 1970 show before the high tech quality taper scene of the 80s and 90s.  Do not miss this one.
