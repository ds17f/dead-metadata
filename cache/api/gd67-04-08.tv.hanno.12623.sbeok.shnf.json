With all due respect to Ssag - Dec. 5 2006 - Dave Freiberg sang other tunes but not Walkin' Blues, that was always sung by Gary Duncan - as I was at most of their live Fillmore and Avalon gigs in the 60's. The order of composite playing was: 1)QMS, 2)Dead, 3)WF (the sloppy guitar solo) 4)Dead (check out Pigpen's harp) and 5)QMS (the finale). Who's ever listening/reading: PLEASE, pretty please scour the friggin' Earth for some live Quicksilver Messenger Service sets. Live, from '66 to '68 they were just as awesome, if not more so, than the incredible, edible Dead.",

We happened to drive by 710 Ashbury as Ralph was standing at the open door of a Cadillac limousine. We saw Jerry, Bob and Pigpen climbing into the car. Ralph waved at us and motioned us to follow, which we did, out to the KPIX studios on Van Ness Avenue (at Greenwich Street). As we were walking in, Quicksilver were walking out. We were bummed, that we missed them. The Dead played Cream Puff War two or three times. We couldn't hear vocals in the studio, as Jerry was singing directly to the soundboard. The performances were incredible. After they recorded the final take, sat down for the interview with Ralph Gleason. It was hard to hear that, since we were sitting pretty far away, behind the cameras in some small bleachers. I saw the first broadcast of the show and have only seen bits and pieces since. What a lucky day, especially since I had been around in Menlo Park and saw much of what happened before these guys went electric and became  the Warlocks then Grateful Dead.",
