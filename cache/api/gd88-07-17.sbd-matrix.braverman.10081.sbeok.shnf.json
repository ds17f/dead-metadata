A high energy, tight performance with a fine song selection, not the most jammed out show, but for '88 it's as good as it gets for big jams. Let it Grow and Althea standout to me in the 1st set. Solid pre-drums but the post drums separates this show from so many others. Bobby growls throughout the Watchtower and then the boys drop it down a bit for a lovely Beleive it or not. What a great tune, this was my favorite Jerry ballad from the later days. Too bad it was droped from the rotation...Sound quality is exceptional. \n\nClose your eyes and be transported to a late afternoon at the Greek...those were the days!!!",

I definitely would have left the house stoked but I don't get the 5 feel from this.\n\nBeleive it or Not is a classic version of a seldom played tune. Worth it for the feel of that song alone.

      "review_text": "Hercules makes a surprise appearance at the Greek I keep comming back to this show. 1988 was much different than 1987.In particular I love the way Bobby plays in this show. Its difficult to describe the sound of this show. It's mechanical in a loose way. The band sounds spaced out and airy. The sound quality is a solid 5 and performance is pretty much a 5.Not everyone likes 88' I always did.Phil makes reference to a struggle in the beginning of 88' in his book searching for the sound. I would agree that the spring 88 tour had it's ups and downs. The summer tour of 88 is much tighter and psychedelic than the majority of the spring tour I've heard. This is not a typical sounding Grateful Dead show. It's not the Good ol Grateful Dead, it's something else. They sound like Pink Floyd with all these little drones,angular lines. Its more jazzy and minimalistic.There are alot of spaces inbetween the notes and beats. Where it lacks in high energy it makes up for it in clarity and smoothness.I know there are soundboards out there of equal quality of the other two nights.I wish I had the other two especially the night with China/Rider. Enjoy..Turn this one up real loud.This show is in memory of Pete 'The Greek' Baldukas who passed away two years ago.",

      "review_text": "Closing out the summer for me Overall:  Really good show.  In keeping with the last two shows, this one has a laid back west coast vibe.  Everything is slower and more open.  Listen to Maine and then these shows back-to-back; you can hear a noticable difference in the high energy east coast style and the laid back open west coast style.  The sound quality on this recording is great.  After getting some nice long jams at a few of the east coast shows, they fall back to pretty short jams here.\n\nThe scene:  the final night of my first Greek Theater run and the end of my first full summer tour, which started back in Alpine.  These were three days of beautiful California sun and fantastic playing.  As someone else mentioned, the weather was really hot for this whole run.  For this night I was dancing in the walkway around the top of the seating and remember it being an absolutely gorgeous evening.  I was flying out of SFO first thing the next morning, so after the show I went and slept in the airport - back when you could still do that!  When I got back home after these shows, I immediately got back to work to save $ for fall tour!  \n\nThe music: Set I:  Foolish starts nice an slow with a relaxed feel.  The whole set retains that feel.  Check Brent's contributions on Big River - simply fantastic.  You can even hear how he gets Bobby into things b/c after Brent's solo, Bobby suddenly brings the vocals with that little bit of extra energy and growl.  That was the magic of Brent - he could raise the musicality and energy of the other members of the band with just a riff here or there.  Mickey gets some good groove going for Let it Grow (listen for his input during the mid-song jam).  In fact, everyone has some great contributions on Let it Grow - this is a really nice version.  \n\nSet II:  Jerry's backing vocals are a little off on Box, but Phil's voice is actually pretty good here.  This is definitely the best Victim thus far.  Bobby sings it with conviction and they begin to stretch the jam a litte (though not as much as later).  Crazy Fingers' third appearance in the last 7 shows - that's a little more often than normal, for some reason.  This one is really nice, with some really fluid playing from Jerry.  Jerry strong arms the jam a little suddenly to steer it into Playing.  Playing is nice, but a bit short.  Same for UJB.  Really nice Watchtower.  During Throwing Stones, Bobby's guitar work really gets in the way of some nice playing from Jerry and Brent.  I'm not a Bobby basher, but he just stays on the same loud distorted chord which just smothers what the other guys are doing.  Blackbird is another hilareous disaster (equally bad as the first attempt in Alpine), but bless 'em for giving it another shot.  Brokedown brings this fine evening to a beautiful close.",

We got smoked by his guitar work - the guitar god that he is - and the bartender said he hadn't seen John that wound up in a long time - it was a great weekend for all.  The weather was more like San Diego and no one was complaining.\n\nWe lit incense at the corner (you know what corner)and almost missed the last show.  I thought I was walking in real early to hang with the heads - hey where is everybody - I said to a fan stepping lively towards the venue - look at your ticket mannnnn - he answered back not missing a beat -D'oh - \n\nAnd we spent time with Chris Cain at Larry Blake's, freakin' awesome show - we just went in - had no idea - we took one look at the set up with the sax and keyboards and knew something was up - and then Bobby Blue Blands scorching version of Stormy Monday came jumping out of the jukebox and the party was on - more dancing and spilling of beer.  Slept at the Pelican Motel - had lunch at Stinson Beach - I'm actually looking at a picture of the lobby of the Pelican with us in it right now - and marveled at the \"Bliss Mobil\" parked out front.\n\nWow, wow, wow, what a music weekend - 5 days and nights of fun, fun, fun, and ran into old friends on top of it all - bliss mobile indeed!\n\nListening to wooden ships (thought it was Grace and Paul singing it though)and it was very etheral (other worldly)walking through Golden Gate hearing that song drift through the woods.  I mean if you didn't catch the magic right then and there you were never going to.\n\nBeing way down front for that Golden Gate Jam with Steve Kimock, Jerry, John Cipollini and a host of others - including the original lineup of Steve and John's Band Zero - Martin on horn and yes Mickey on percussion.  \n\nThe Not Fade Away audience response at the end of this show was really strong and we had a great time singing that at the top of our lungs.  Basked on the hill all day like a couple of seals - dancing seals that is - dancing, air guitar playing seals - okay thats got it.\n\nBelieve it or not - just a few moments - we love you too Jerry - check out Philly 1988 - not fade away - the crowd develops its own call and response - very cool - love the whole audience participation about these events - like I heard Phil say once - you have to put something of yourself into the music - and there's the thing, the pay off, the vibe, the moment, the magic - all being tugged together by creativity - our god.\n\nWell Jerry's gone and he's never comin' back 13 years later I'm starting to listen to the music again.  There was a time right after he died where I couldn't - I mean I just couldn't - it didn't take thirteen years - but it did take a while.  \n\nThere's a world of beautiful music and musicians out there from 17th century baroque transcripts from unknown composers to Arturo O'Farrill.\n\nKeep on keepin on old friends and I'll see you around some corner where it's been waiting to greet you - love to all and to all a goodnight!\n\nPaul\nAuthor - Journey Home",

      "review_text": "A wonderful stealth show! For many, myself 1988, is a often overlooked year. The last time this show was reviewed was  almost three years. In my case I  got  off the  bus in late 1987. I  did get some tapes from the MSG shows from the fall of this year and they were not nearly as impressive as this night.\n\n\nThis  year was the  beginning of Garcia & Hunter's last great songwriting period and many staples of the 1990's came out of this period.\n\nThree are  featured in this performance, of which one would disappear by October only to reappear once more in the Spring of 1990 believe it or not\n\nSet one is a nice set list and I have grown to appreciate these earlier versions of Foolish Heart, which by 1990 was one of my  second set favorites. The tempo is  slower but Garcia thoroughly enjoys singing it and as other reviews stated this version gets better as it it  played.\n\nGSET is cranking and except for Healy's  unnecessary messing with Bob's vocals,  something he commonly did this during the  late '80's up until the summer tour of 1990. Was it out of boredom? Who know's but the band did  fire him by by 1994 and this has to be one of the reasons why.\n\nAlthea is a strong version  with the band settling in quite nicely and firing on all cylinders. A couple  cowboy tunes, Big River is very good, and then back to Jerry, who coming in from from Memphis where he learned to talk the  jive.\n\nI always loved this song and the band delivers a  solid performance.\n\nThe highlight of this, less than 60 minute, first set is the Let it Grow. The band plays it with a sonic reckoning urgency that is  full of beauty and power. It would be another six months until the Midi sound changed this song dramatically.\n\nI am a purist and prefer these pre-Midi versions and once you listen to it you know why. Jerry just completey unleashes on this one and Bob vocals are strong and passionate. Phil is right there as well.\n\nSet to is down right strong from start to finish and  features a  great set list.\nThe \"Let Phil Sing!\"  chant although not as common as it once had been, as Phil more than likely would sing one tune during a strong run. Tonight is no exception.\n\nBox Rain gets the vibes going in the right direction. Then the first surprise, the west coast breakout of Victim. This  version is excellent and has that focus that  makes the song a modern GD standout., then back to the essentials with a sweet version of Crazy Fingers, which in my opinion continued to get better as they played it through out the remainder of their GD career.\n\nThe PITB is short but is quite enjoyable with a smooth transition into a very strong Uncle John's Band. The D>S is not outrageous and is more of a cerebral stroll through the sonic garden on this hot Sunday afternoon\n\nThe GDTRFB  picks up right where UJB left off and the band cranks it up, along with Phil's bass,. Watchtower is extremely intense and Phil and Jerry just rage on it.\n\nThis drops into a  memorable and sweet Believe it or Not, which has Jerry really being as intimate with his vocals as he ever could be. Robert Hunter would love this version.\n\nThe set ending T.Stones> NFA has the  former being the strong of the two.\n\nBlackbird is sweet and not as perfect as one would desire but it does feature Bob on the acoustic and is bittersweet.\n\nJerry closes out the night and the run with a poetic Brokedown for those loyal and loving freaks at the Greek\n\nHappy Trails.\n",
