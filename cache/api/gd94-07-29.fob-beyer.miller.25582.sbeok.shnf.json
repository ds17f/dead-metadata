A marked improvement to say the least. Overall, not an amazing show, but one of the better ones at this portion of the east/midwest 94 run. \n\nJerry sounds burnt during the Foolish refrain.

The boys were in a great mood, Jerry was dancing (well doing the Jerry sway we all love), they were all smiling. It was pouring rain the whole first set, which brought on all the rain tunes, the rain cleared just in time for the Standing On the Moon, while dancing in the trees under bright moon, high energy lovelight, even freaking Samba was rockin that night lol and what could very well be the best Mighty Quinn I have heard live while in the Phil Zone surrounded by friends. \n\nWe were wet, muddy and having the time of our lives.\n\nI made a ton of money that day in the lot, got a ticket for face early in the day, loved the friends I was riding with, spend the show with a boy I cared alot about, the night walking around laughing dancing playing, we found after much seaching the french bread veggie pizza van (they were hiding), watched the sunrise, gosh I could go on and on, it was a wonderful night, it was magic... My personal favorite of summer 94. Well East coast summer 94 anyway. :) \n\nBlessings, \nSunny",

      "review_text": "great experience @ a great show I'd never been to Buckeye Lake before this show, and it was quite a different environ than many other venues.   I recall sitting in traffic trying to get the parking field/lot for a good while.   Walking around the lot were LOADS of people holding up HUGE mushrooms for sale---and it seemed that there were NO cops patroling at all.   There was a police helicopter flying over though.   I was hawking cookies @ 2 f/$1 or 5 f/$2, and made my pockets fat to offset the costs of the trip.\n\nBack to the fine fungus---bought some and ate-em on the way into the show.   By the time it started to rain they were kicking in.   Had a minor freak-out over all the wind that kicked up & the possibility of tornadoes.   But rain or shine, the GD threw it into gear from the start.   The whole first set it rained, but I seem to remember it clearing some and the sun shining through the clouds before 2nd set started---beautiful!   There were small platforms that had large TV cameras filmimg the show---does anyone recall the \"APPLAUSE\" message that was shown on the screens @ the end of Deal?   I found that to be hilarious!\n\nThe second set was no slouch either.   Previous mentions about Samba even being a fine performance are correct.   Me & a friend managed to get pretty close to the stage during a good bit of 2nd set, which usually wasn't too easy considering everyone that crowds as close to the stage as they can in GA shows.\n\nOverall, it was a good show, and worth the listen.",

Oh well.\n\nIt was my first show, long overdue, and all the reviews above are INCREDIBLY accurate about the show, the rain etc. Someone even OD right in front of me at the beginning and it was crazy I think the person died not sure. Security guard looking at me screaming for a DR....surreal.\n\nThe show was amazing. After relistening a few times I love it more- how ironic was it that the song Uncle Johns Band got me into the Dead- and was played from scratch as previously noted- a nice 20 minute version amazing.\n\nI have had fun showing these review to my younger brother whom never saw Jerrry- this was a time I travelled from Florida to Ohio to see the Dead and it was so fantastic. Great show fudge the negative reviews it rocks. SOunds like being there in the crowd.",

      "review_text": "Good 1994 Dead show Excellent sound quality and a really good show. I am just starting to get into 2 things regarding the Dead I don't know much about - AUD recordings and post-1993 shows. Ive heard so much negative things about '94-'95 that as a budding Deadhead I just never bothered checking any shows out from that period. Sorry but to these ears this is a hot show. The newer songs are all excellently played (Samba, Eternity, Standing on the Moon). 1st set has really sick versions of Bertha, Deal and esp. Eternity, which is a song I never really liked but this version is great. Anyone have any other '94-'95 recommendations?",

Traffic had reformed that year and was opening this show (along w/ a few others that tour). They were just amazing - very high level musicianship. After seeing nearly 150 shows spanning 20 years ('75 - '95), I'll always remember this show as the \"Rain Show\" and of course for Traffic.",

      "review_text": "forces of nature Drove up from Louisiana to catch Buckeye and the rest of the summer run. This show was in the pastures outside of Hebron, Ohio - with virtually no presence of the law. What people referred to as 'Shakedown' sprung up in one of the more open, sloping fields, a spontaneous medieval market. There was Boocoo open country - lots of ecstatic and +lysergic energy going on. The stage crew filmed the crowd rushing into the stage area when it opened, and spliced it with images of ranging cattle, playing these images back to us on the overhead screens at various moments during the show.  \n\nTBH I don't remember much of Traffic's performance b/c I was out of my mind on the Dancing Skeletons and the approaching rainstorm. I remember high-octane winds introducing the storm, giving a severe and elemental twist to the general energy of the situation; you could see Jerry and Billy K stageside - smiling, bopping, getting into the end of Traffic's set, the electrons of the storm, and the general crowd scene. Somewhere around the end of Traffic's set or right after, the sky was pretty pregnant w/SOMEthing - it got very dark and dropped on us. I remember the rain/wind being hard enough that the crowd started up makeshift tarps/rainguards. I remember being a human post for one of these 'tents' - drenched and tripping fantastic, utterly satisfied. So the crowd sat out the storm ...and The Dead took the stage when the rain eventually began to lift, revealing blinking stars to an ecstatic audience. The wide-open spaces and weather outside of Hebron that night made for a special recipe, spicing up the energy of the show in a really unique way. UJB bug-eyed the muddy post-apocalyptic audience - and if you were There, The Mighty Quinn was pretty damn mighty, wrapped up with a bow, Jerry winking at us. \n\nBefore the storm this venue was a bucolic paradise - after the show it was a muddy dark wasteland. I have no idea how I was able to find my friends and my car that night, trudging back through the mud in the joyous herds. If the Rain was gonna fall, well, we can say in hindsight that it was right on time: the scene thrived in the summer heat before the show, and the exact timing/duration of the downpour was effectively perfect. Supersonic backwoods psychedelic Baptism.     \n\nOn strictly musical terms this show wasn't exceptional to my ears then or now (which isn't to say that I didn't enjoy & treasure every second of it then and now), but even a cursory glance at the set-list testifies to its singular energy being severely upgraded by the forces of earth and sky, and a really unique scene not possible in more populated areas. This combo was the real deal, folks - a really off-the-grid, exceptionally Close Encounter between the forces of nature, America's greatest rock&roll band, and hordes/herds of Friendly and very enthusiastic Freaks.   \n\nWith a nod to gratefulvince(see below) - I'd say the most musically exciting Dead show I saw that summer was right after this Buckeye romp - on 7/31, at The Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan, right outside of Detroit. Great bday party show w/ Jerry blowing out the candles.(one of nine in the history of the band I'm aware of). Check out Keith Litzenberger's AUD of the Auburn Hills show. \n\nCheers to the caravans from Buckeye to The Palace that summer... Ah, the magic carpet of the Good Ole US of A. Thanks to everyone who made this now legendary 'Rain' show so special.",

Well, we left our camp completly open and needless to say when we returned I think I had a very tiny courner of a dry tent. I remember \"blanket city\" over our heads when Jerry struck the cord to Rain and, like the song says, \"and I don't mind\" One of the best shows I got to see before the passing of Jerry. \"Right on\" my brother, may you still be making beautiful music in our souls!!!!!!",

I was there with my brother and we were tripping so hard in our car in \"traffic\" on the side of the highway that we didn't notice everyone going into the show and just parking where they were. We were laughing hysterically over stupid stuff and finally made it in during Althea. I was SO pissed (and still bothers me to this day) to miss half the first set, including the Rain opener. That's when it was still rare to hear at all, much less out of the encore slot. Love that tune. No worries though, still a lot in the 2nd set so plenty of music. Love the bouncing, pumping Foolish to kick off second set, Want to Tell and Saint never hurt much and the SOTM was perfect. My birthday was the 30th so by the time they played my first ever Mighty Quinn encore right after midnight my brother looked at me and said \"Happy Birthday\". A memorable night and everything I've read on the comments here about the atmosphere and weather was true. Then, we go to our car in the morning and we were out of gas. Ah well, a 20-minute hike to a small auto station over the hill and in the middle of nowhere, and we were back on our way to Chicagoland. This show and the 2nd night at Deer Creek (7/20/94)--another great rain show--were highlights of that tour for me. ",

I think I will do Set 2 over at the latter. \n\nThe Dead used their in-ear monitor system to communicate with each other privately in between songs, but they occasionally forgot to switch off the mic feed to the loudspeakers. At the beginning of this show, Vince complains about the band changing the tempo of rain, and Jerry responds. At the end of Althea, Bobby suggests playing Eternity to the band, and it goes through to the speakers. You can hear people in the crowd shout \"NO! NO!\" in response, which I find absolutely hilarious. I guess Bobby's new songs were never very popular. Apparently, people used to complain about how much Estimated Prophet was played in '77, believe it or not. \n\nSet 1 Highlights: Rain, Deal. All good performances, but no major standouts. Bobby had a number of equipment/sound gripes. \n\nSet 2 HIGHlights: Listen to it all! Beautiful SOTM. The Mighty Quinn rounds it out.",
