      "review_text": "Good summer '95 show. This is a hard show to review, as it starts and ends rather sloppily, but the middle contains some of the best energy of the '95 Summer Tour. The show gets off to a really bad start with a very off-key Stranger - Garcia sounds more like he is casually jamming along to a tune on the radio rather than playing with the rest of the band. However, after a shakey Bertha this show really picks up with a sharp Same Thing, followed by an on fire Stagger Lee, Jerry really getting into the groove. Eternity is a bit messy as always, but could have been a lot worse. Deal though is again right on target, with Jerry doing some really great runs for '95, even if he isn't turned up too loud for some of the song. \n\n Fortunatly the energy doesn't stop there, flowing right into the second set with the best China>Rider of the tour, a great version of Way To Go (which will get you rocking even if you're not much of a Vince fan), and a nice Eyes which Jerry handles very well both lyrically and musically. After Drums and Space however, the momentum starts to fade - A decent Spanish Jam and powerful Miracle are followed by one of the strangest moments I've ever heard at a GD show. Jerry sounds like he is going to play the intro for Throwing Stones, but then tries to morph it into an out of time Wharf Rat...though he can't quite get it right, and repeats it over and over. The rest of the band completely STOP while they wait to see what he's trying to do, and have only just joined in with his spacey little jam when he starts singing! Right chords, right lyrics, wrong rhythm, and this is only rectified after the first chorus! Needless to say, this very awkward moment puts an end to the party pretty much, with NFA and Lucy In The Sky being very average renditions, Jerry's playing sinking back into shakey mode. \n\n  Sound wise, this recording is very good for an AUD, not too much crowd noise, not too much echo and not too much bass. And on a technical note, this show fits nicely on 2 discs if you put China>Rider and WTG on Disc 1. Download this show if you want to hear some great energy for such a late date, but be warned that the Wharf Rat intro will put things back into perspective.",

This is a 95 show so im sure you wont be shocked that it wasn't very good.  Wharf rat was strange, I would download that if I were you just to check it out.  Otherwise I would go for something else.

I remember as we left we commented that garcia neede to check himself in for  some rest. those jumbo tron monitors  were not kind on Jerrys frail , sickly looking self. I really felt like we were watching a genious dying.. sad and upset are words that come to mind. I saw my first show in 74.. and  this was the worst, some previous folks were very kind in there reviews.. both nights at giants stadium were weak at best... after jerry checked out.. my brother tom said i was cryptical  at the giants stadium shows saying  we may never see him again... who knew... I would loose my brother 6 years later   on sept. 11th... I never saw that comming... Im sure jerry is playing som e sweet music for all  ..  anyt way most of 95 and this show in particular are for the folks who need every thing.... thanks jerry for a great ride...",

Garcia's direct response to this request was ....\"sure let her have it, maybe that's why they keep coming.\"\n\n\n\nThis show along with all of '95. I stopped being in Grateful Dead denial in '93 and listening to some samples of the final 2 years of GD.... what a good decision that was. Heck even the band knew they sucked at that point. The good thing about the GD being gone is it allows one to be objective and choose, without having to rationalize something ongoing. I have gravitated to the period between '70-'74. I find this period contains some of the most listenable music (beyond the weirdness of the 60's and before the bullshit 80's and 90's). More important than any sound or style, what I hear most in the 70's is musicianship. The net result is the best American music that I've ever heard (just watch the new release of the movie) Garcia was brilliant, and what sheer joy it is to just sit there and watch it. So to the junk pile with all that Easy Answers/Samba in the Rain/Wang Dang Doodle/ teleprompter shit, and give me the good ole Grateful Dead. R.I.P JJG.",

I know the others who were at this one with me, got goose bumops during China>Rider. It is very well sung & played, Jerry wails his \"Northbound train\" part! Jiffyruffle was right in judging that one. Hands down the best China>Rider of '95!! Yes Wharf Rat was very shaky, but I what would you give to hear Jerry sing any song again?! Great setlist, above average show (for '95) The only reason I gave this one 5 stars is to boost the rating average.  Don't hesitate, this one is not as bad as everyone else seems to think. All of the other reviewers are basing their rating by comparing this show to one from the 70's Or one of the other hundreds they say they saw.

I'll continue to speak honestly, however. When the boys were on they were beyond amazing, but they weren't all keepers, folks, and some of them weren't even very good.\n\nBy the mid 90s, most of them weren't.\n\nPoorly played music is just that, regardless of who is manning the instruments. Garcia is obviously beyond exhausted, and his bandmates are audibly going through the motions. It all adds up to a once great band no longer able to find even a brief spark of the old firepower. As a whole, this show blows. The first set is lifeless, though not appreciably worse than the typical soggy 1995 effort. The pre-drums portion of the second set continues the evening's free fall, and the post drums segment is nothing short of musical incontinence, \"highlighted\" by  the embarrassing debacle that occurs as Jerry fumbles for his place at the start of \"Wharf Rat\". He isn't \"doing something new\", he's completely lost. This epidsode is discussed in Blair Jackson's Garcia: An American Life. Both the band and the crew recognized this as an uninentional train wreck. To claim 10 years after the fact that he \"meant\" to fall apart like that is nothing more than revisionist history. \n\nTruly horrid.",

The poor misguided soul down below who thinks that \"Wharf Rat\" sounds funny because Jerry was trying to \"give us a Dylan-style version\" is in complete denial. Jerry played it that way because he didn't know where the fuck he was in the music. He was up there in front of 50,000 people trying to play a song he'd been playing for 24 years and he had no idea how to do it. Point blank period. The rest of the band practically stops playing because they didn't know what the hell was going on. Blame drugs, age, exhaustion, indifference, whatever, but the bottom line was that it was a moment of utter incompetence that was painful to listen to.\n\n\nThe Dead had plenty of off nights in their career, but this was different- it was as though all of the skill, energy, and magic had been drained from the group, and you just knew it wasn't coming back. Saying some version or another is \"one of the best of '95\" does nothing to recommend it. This whole year was a sad joke. The first 2/3rds of this show is incredibly weak, but the post drums segment is a true abomination.

First of all, let me start off by saying that the show is clearly not a stellar effort by any stretch of the imagination, and the sound quality of this AUD is lacking as well; however, I would just like to assure anyone that doesn't know any better that Garcia, who was obviously not doing that well, did not just \"get lost in the music\" during Wharf Rat. Actually what he did was relatively creative, as he took a shuffle, Wharf Rat, a song in which the verses are usually swung and instead played a modified theme of Throwing Stones, aborting the triplet feel of a tune that is swung to a song where there is an eighth note pulse. Conceptually speaking, he was doing something relatively cool, but in performance THROUGHOUT, it is terrible. That is NOT all Garcia's fault, and if you listen to the rest of the band too, you will realize Jerry's idea doesn't change, but the rest of The Dead, having gotten so used to playing the song swung, struggle to follow Jerry. Should Jerry have rehearsed this idea with the rest of the gang? Sure! Should he at least have communicated it to them during their drum break? Probably, if they were even talking to each other at that point. However, I think that this situation is more indicative of what the Dead were at this stage. It stated in McNally's book on the Dead that at this point in the bands history, one day, the sound guy (Cutler?) checked each individual in-ear monitor mix only to find out that each player in the band was TUNING OUT the other band members in their monitor mix, listening to themselves most prominently, and THAT is ugly! Yes, Garcia was sick, but to pin all of the Dead's musical problems on him is just as ridiculous as giving him all of the credit when the band sounded great.",

However, remember Dylan opened these shows and killed. I remember hearing Weir and Mickey commenting that why didn't *that* Dylan show up in their tour together. Jerry, to me when I was watching the show, was clearly phrasing Wharf Rat like Dylan. I turned to my friend at the time and said, he's singing this like Dylan would. Later most everyone thought he messed it up, but one other friend of mind caught it also. Soooo...am I right? I don't know but I certainly think so. I do know everyone that is so sure of him screwing it up might not be right either. Oh, my last show, I skipped the 2nd night for the first time in my life at Giants.

Half the time he was just pointing\n at members of the audience  and laughing. Still\n a worthwhile show, but there were probably plenty\n of people who would have written a review right\n afterwards that exactly mirrored the sentiments\n of the naysayers for this show!\n\n  One problem may be that Jerry and the boys\n were finally breaking past the rock idiom\n and experimenting with subtle and intricate\n jazz stylings that simply sailed over the\n heads of the post-\"In The Dark\" crowd who\n simply came to party. Half the '95 crowd\n at most shows didn't know the difference\n between Around and Around and Dark Star.\n No offense intended.\n __________________________________________________\n What a fascinating discussion on this show. So\n polarized and regarding such a controversial  \n year. My download was really slow this time, so\n I took my time and carefully read every review\n before listening to the music. \n\n My take is that the Wharf Rat is INDEED THE\n REAL THING!! And very exciting and bold at that!\n Garcia is clearly not confused and fumbling,\n but he is feeling his way, exploring a new\n musical interpretation. The boys back him up\n just fine. I have to say this rendition is\n both a creative success and listenable.\n\n  While it is true that there are many, many\n fine moments in 1995, the boys were definitely\n engaged in a tough uphill struggle and Garcia\n was the cement sled. But even on a terrible\n night this band outperformed equivalent super-\n bands.\n  I grew up in England in the 1960s and was\n extremely lucky to have been exposed to the\n immortal music scene of that period.  \n Nevertheless, the number of totally stinker\n Rolling Stones Concerts must number in the\n many hundreds - I mean a complete lack of even\n basic musical functionality. The Who, while\n geniuses in their own right, confined themselves\n musically to a very basic skill level and\n yet performed many shows at a level that would\n make a subpar bar band blush.\n  Get enough musical experience under your belt\n and you'll never regret listening to the Dead\n again.",

Its almost like he's playing the opening riff of Throwing Stones along with Wharf Rat but in a strangely done manner.  His timing on the vocals are so off it's not funny.  The band behind him have no idea whats going on and can't follow him.  Usually when the Dead redo a song they practice it some before hand. But in this version you can clearly hear they didn't and five guys behind Jerry are floundering about because they clueless as to whats going on. It sounds like a jam with Wharf Rat's lyrics. Further proof to me that Wharf Rat did not go well is the fact the next song (NFA) Jerry was turned down and you can't hear him  It is also the only time I have ever heard were he doesn't take a solo on NFA.\n\nAnyways I am not a good judge of this era so my opinion might not be good. I hardly have listen to the 90's shows if ever. In fact I have never heard any of the new songs like Days Between etc.. After 300 shows in the 80's I quit in 1991 and didn't look back.  The scene no longer justified the music to me. I still regularly (daily) listen to the 60',70's and early 80's but this time period I can't justify.  It's too cluttered and plastic (synthetic and computer generated) sounding for my tastes. Remember now this is only my opinion and never are opinions fact.",

Personally, I did my dead stuff from 87-91, but did spring 95 for nostalga's sake. My favorite years to listen to are 79, 85, 89 and 90. That being said, I was surprisingly able to get into this one, surprising because I expected the worst. The drum/piano start to China Cat is unique and cool, as is this rendition. Samson is above average. Eyes is solid, I dig the outtro to drums. The Wharf Rat is kinda interesting in a morbid sort of way. Who knows what Garcia had going through his head. Stagger Lee is pretty hot, worth checking out. Spanish jam isn't what it was so many times, but easily listenable and quite pleasing. Ditto Miracle. Hey, I don't listen to 95 much, in fact this is the first time I can remember since that tour, and this one ain't too shabby.",

      "review_text": "Wharf Rat tidbit I just finished Blair Jackson's biography of Garcia and in it he quotes Bob Bralove saying that he really got scared when at this show, Jerry gets lost in the beginning of Wharf Rat and can't get out. He knew at that point it was much more than just the drugs that was kicking Jerry's ass. \n\nIt's interesting to listen to, as he can't find his way until the drummers take over and get the tempo together and cue him right before the burgundy wine lyric. So no, he was not trying a new arrangement as someone earlier in these reviews suggests. \n\nThis book is a must read if you really want an insiders experience and a flat out tour by tour history. It's great!",

I don't have a lot of music knowledge but could tell something was wrong on stage, particularly with Wharf Rat. The Dead must have done the Miracle/Rat combo hundreds of times but it took Jerry half the song to find the right tempo. Almost sounds like he is playing Throwing Stones which they wound up aborting and instead went directly into the lamest Not Fade Away I ever heard. \nThe first set is another six song throw away which was common place by this point. The second set had a nice set list but the playing never matched the selections. Eyes in particular never came close to the decent version I saw in Vegas a month before. \nI sold my tickets for the next night and while I regret missing the show, at least I didn't have to experience Corrina\\Matilda as my final Dead memory.",

I'd have to say there are better shows, but, who cares?  It still is 100% better than 90% of bands out there.  So are these reviews based on comparing the dead to the dead, or the dead to whatever the hell else is out there?  If we're comparing to other dead shows, sure it's a 2.5 to 3 star show.  If we're comparing to other performances by any other band out there, it's a 5+ star show.  I don't know though, I listened to the whole thing, and I really don't know what ya'll are talking about.  I think the space was fantastic, Spanish is one of my favourites, even the supposedly horrible wharf was just fine.  I'm satisfied with my daily Dead.",

      "review_text": "THE GRATEFUL DEAD !!!!! This was my final time seeing the late great Jerry Garc1a perform. My first concert was at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic NJ in 1978 when I was 13. I feel blessed to have been on board for 17 of the Garcia years. I continue to go to this day and thank God have been fortunate enough to have not missed any of the incarnations after Jerry died. The Other Ones - The Furthur Festivals - The Dead - Phil and Friends - Ratdog and now Furthur. I go for the same reason now at 45 years old as I did way back when. I just dig it (the good - bad and the ugly / warts and all) \nUs East Coast deadheads are very fortunate being the band played the hell out of our area and still do. MSG - The Meadowlands - Nassau - The Spectrum - The Capitol - The Tower - Englishtown and Giants Stadium. Like I said this was my final show and I treasure it. 1995 was what it was and thats it. To say the magic was gone is fucken ridiculous. I was there at the Spectrum for the 1st Unbroken Chain and when the crowd realized in a state of disbelieve what was happining it was MAGICAL. The Visions of Johanna on 7-8-95 - MAGICAL - the So Many Roads on 7-9-95 was MAGICAL. There were some ass kickin nights in 95. This show for example was a good 95 show. Yes it did fall apart with Wharfrat and Not Fade Away. Wharfrat was sad and beautiful all at the same time. It is clear Garcia was lost BIG TIME. If he'd stuck with the faster arrangment he went to after the 2 minutes of fumbling it could have been pulled off. When he switched to the usual arrangement in the middle you knew it was totally fucked up and he was lost. And yes there was no solo during Not Fade Away. So fucken what -- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH -- nope lets not say thanks for 30 great years. Lets talk shit about a  musical genius who was clearly fading away before our eyes. This guy gave the best he had to give right till the end. Dont you haters realize this. I mean what the fuck the guy would be dead in less than 3 months. Jesus Christ most people stay home from work with the flu. Picture going to work in front of 50000 people when you have less than 3 months to live - Jerry must have felt like shit and still was 50 times better than most. I'm right now listening to the China Cat and am totally diggin the drumming intro and this Spanish Jam is excellent - I mean great. Again this show was good man - trust me I was there. God Bless Jerry Garcia and God Bless the Grateful Dead. There's nothing like a Grateful Dead Concert !!!",

I attended 3 concerts on this final tour, starting in Vermont and seeing both at Giants Stadium.  I met up with some old Deadheads, that took me to my first concert on 4-12-83. I thought this concert was the best performance I had seen in years (approx. 1991. The 'whole' thing' became too big.  I remember the crowd being almost louder than the band and guffawing as a group during the transition into 'Wharf Rat' and then doing the 'Not Fade Away' clap as if trying to force the tune from the band. While The Grateful Dead may have had somewhat of a format in the later years and worked hard to please their fans, they were not a 'juke box'. I think this was a great performance for the year. Maybe, it goes back to what Bill Graham reiterated before the encore at the 4-29-71 concert.  The Grateful Dead are not a band, they are an environment.  Your personal experience at the concert is more important than someone else's perception.  I don't really want to analyze it to death, either.  Take it for what it is or move on.",

The roady informed Mr. Snider that some audience members actually through shit at them, Snider was beside himself that someone could be so disgusted by a live performance that they would actually pull down their pants, squat on the ground, take a shit, then pick it up with their bare hands and throw it at them!\n      Well I wasn't at this show.

The China Rider is nice and the eyes is certainly listenable and played at a nice pace with Jerry audible throughout but playing and singing.  The Wharf Rat is the low point maybe of alltime on stage. Jerry must have chased the dragon when he left for drums, Before that and even through space this show is enjoyable, it is not life changing dead but it beats Ratdog or most Dead cover acts.  Only saw them twice after this show and this was better than either of those by leaps and bounds.  Many just automatically give 1995 1 star.",
