      "review_text": "4-17-82 - excellent moments This show, and 4-18-82, were some of the best played at Hartford. 4-17 spills over the sides with crackling energy - Of particular note is the solid shakedown, with Jerry and Brent trading riffs playfully - Sailor was memorable for the goofing Jerry and Phil did behind bob - they swayed back and forth in *perfect* choreography for a good bit of the tune (like backup dancers), and Bob couldn't figure out why we were all cracking up in front....\n\nTHere is a Spanish Jam, but it is after Saint leading into drums, and without Jerry. Bob really shines - The drums space is remarkable (no foreshadow for the next's nights madness) with  the lead-in to UJB absolutely beautiful. The jam from UJB into NFA is also fairly unique when juxtaposed against the more predictable versions that NFA would evolve into...\n\nFinally, the Baby Blue (\"for all you folks up back there who've been watching the back of our heads\" bw) stands out as THE monster version - Jerry rips \"forget the dead you left\" verse with overwhelming power and emotion.\n\nThis show made the difficult security scene at Hartford worth the effort to get to a space for dancing.....",

      "review_text": "Break out that old Victrola, put on your Rocking Shoes!! Awesome funky Shakedown with grate solos by Garcia and amazing interplay between him and Brent. Brent's keys sound really trippy. This is followed by my all time fav Sailor>Saint. Passionate vocals by Bobby and ripping runs by Jerry. UJB is excellent. What gets me post Drums on this show every time is Around and Around>OMSN. I love Bobby's vocals on this. OMSN in particular is so grate. Bobby is just beside himself. \n1982 is a landmark year for the Dead. For me this is the end of the Good Ol Grateful Dead Era that began in 1977. Its the last year Jerry can sing. Its the last year before the Junky Jerry era (83-85)which is one of my fav periods, but is nowhere near as tight as 77-82. The change between 82-83 is significant. 82 was the last year it had that really tight sharp sound. This is an excellent example of Good Ol Grateful Dead. Get it if you dont got it.  \n\nPeace\nDavid",

Hitch-hiked to this one from a repressive Western MA prep school and missed the Minglewood but caught about half of Sugaree.  Got into the Russian Lady in downtown Hartford after the show. Some douchebag bouncer let me and my five 16 year old friends in because we bribed him with a $20. What a peach of human being!!! As noted by an earlier reviewer, a nice Lost Sailer/Saint of Circumcision on this one, but for a better one try Achorage, AK 6/20/80. And can anyone for the life of them distinquish the so-called \"Spanish Jam\" from the plain old garden-variety \"Space Jam\"?  It's all just white noise to this cowboy.",

      "review_text": "Outstanding 2d Set & Great Sound \ufeffDisregard the review below this one.  This is one of the best 2d sets of 1982.  The first set is pretty standard stuff although nicely played.  The second set however, kicks off with a thunderous Shakedown which develops a really nice groove in the middle jam before winding down into the first version of Lost Sailor>St. that I recall hearing that was more than just a time-killer (read bathroom song).  This was the show where I finally got the point that Sailor>St. could be a killer combination.  It's too bad Lost Sailor was shelved after the Philly run in '86.  \n\nThe Spanish Jam is mislabeled on the list and actually comes before the drums.  The post drums sequence is both well-executed and interesting.  The rare UJB rising out of the space is a real treat and was quite a surprise at the time.  The NFA that follows is blistering.  The rest of the set is typical, but good, post-drums fare for 1982.  The Baby Blue encore, however, was another treat.   These earlier Baby Blues were not as perfunctory as the ones the band was doing as encores later in the 80's.  Jerry nails the vocals on this one and does a few nice leads, so this is one to savor.\n\nTake my word for it, if you have not downloaded this show, just do it -- don't even think about it, just do it.",

      "review_text": "Space > Uncle John's > Not Fade Away > Wharf Rat Haven't heard this upload in a couple of years and was scratching my head when I heard the Minglewood again. I now have to rewrite this whole \"SBD\" review.  I hate to tell youz guyz, but I think everyone else has to relisten too.  This sounds like an F.O.B.  Listen to how close the whistling is.  It's closer than the band... much closer.  I read on bt.etree somewhere there is a Nak 700 > D5 FOB from Barry Glassberg that isn't circulating much.  Well this could be it.  I've also heard about another, possibly by Rob Eaton. \n\nWoops, sorry guyz.  Looks like Minglewood was an AUD patch.  Hmm, will I have to rewrite for a third time?  Think not.  Anyway, I've had a so-so, muddy audience copy of the second set since late '82.  Not having kept the 1st set (I am not a completeist), Fitzy may be correct that the majority of the show is just average. But the Minglewood was solid so it might be better than I remember (Not that I've ever had to rethink my opinion about a show.)  \n\nThe above segment of the second set is one of my favorite passages in GD history.  The long, delicate intro by Jerry into UJB is just so wonderful, it almost - well, yes it does - it brings tears to my eyes.  They really nail the body too - w/ cowbell. And the trans into NFA is fabulous. I agree wholeheartedly with all of Bill's review...very unique.  Both favorites!  My only beef is that NFA is fairly short.  It's funny, my impression with UJB is also the same.  But at over nine minutes, I really can't complain.  I guess it's just becuase I truly want it to go on forever.............................",

Although I saw the Dead several times up close at GA concerts, I actually had a ticket for a front row center seat. At the time I was lucky enough to have a friend whose mom worked for the HCC box office and she punched out the first 4 tickets for this show and gave them to her son. The highlight of this show was Baby Blue when the band actually played to the folks behind the stage...thats the only time I've ever seen that. Great TJ, IAON, Shakedown, LS & SOS.",

The second set is a 5+ for the many reasons already stated including the shakedown, the awsome spanish jam w/out Jerry, and the post drum segment.  \n\nAlthough I am not a minglewood fan, the set opener starts off with a great grove and rest of set doesen't look back.\n\nThis board is solid and would give it a 5- rating. As mentioned on other post, I think these three shows (4/17, 4/18, and 4/19) are the best in 82 - all good soundboards too.\n\nThank you Archive!",

      "review_text": "Duty When I saw this listing as a Bertha Remaster since I have heard over 100 Bertha Remasters I felt it my duty to hear this one and give a report.\n\nIt's a really good show and a really good recording spruced up by the Bertha-thizing. All the songs are well-played and Jerry and Bobby sing good, too.\n\nThe Sugaree is pretty nice. Towards the end Jerry goes into his fanning mode and then continues on with the fanning longer than usual. It sounds sort of half-hearted at first, but eventually you recognize that Jerry is playing this way for effect. \n\nThe Bobby Womack song All Over Now covered by the Rolling Stones is a song the GD did from their stint as the Warlocks in Palo Alto. The Dead loosely patterned themselves after the 1965 Stones and this was part of their fledgling repertoire. This version is relaxed and easy to entreat ~ perfect for lounging around on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nHave to say that the recording from out of the Hartford CC is special for the clear vocals. This must have been a decent room for acoustics. Previous Reviewers have noted that the Dead played this venue well.\n\nWhat proceeds is an elegant Bird Song highlighted by Jerry's gentle gnat notes. This is a song the band loved performing. Have the GD ever played a bad version of this song? \n\nAnd what can anyone say about the African based Man Smart Woman Smarter? A pedestrian tune ala Aiko that sort of salves and lubricates and makes your body sway. Like Aiko this song was a semi AM radio hit in the mid 60's. It's a pleasant song. If I had a say in it, I would change it to \"women are wiser\" not smarter. Hence: Man Smart Women Wise.\n\nShakedown Sailor Saint = all choice stuff. Great jams, highbrow playing. It's all there just the way you like it.\n\nThe rest of the second set is just as good. All Good stuff, competently dispatched.",

Then it turns into the SBD. We're all spoiled by Charlie Miller's uploads, and he tends to note all the AUD patches.  The Around and Around track actually includes One More Saturday Night.  The OMSN track is just crowd noise, FYI.  I love the fact they turned to play to the audience sitting behind the stage.  Truly, a Heart of Gold band.",

      "review_text": "40 Years Ago Today It's hard to believe it's been 40 years since I saw this show.  My 7th show on the Spring 1982 tour.  This one and April 6th at the Spectrum were the most memorable.  This show is excellent from beginning to end, but what sets it apart from other shows is the 45 minutes of music from the end of Space --> UJB through the Baby Blue encore. Jerry's voice is at its strongest and sweetest (since 1977) this tour, and really, never to be again.  Plus, the way the songs, post-drums are joined together, with Jerry leading the rhythm section, is refreshingly  unique for this era.  If you know of a better vocal performance by Jerry than the way he sings this Baby Blue, well, I'd like to hear it.  This show is in heavy rotation for me and is in my top 5 shows seen, along with 10/31/1979, 8/29/1980, 9/2/1980, 5/17/1981 and 6/28/1985.  I know, that makes 6 shows.  If you haven't listened to this show, or haven't listened to it in a while, what are you waiting for?",
