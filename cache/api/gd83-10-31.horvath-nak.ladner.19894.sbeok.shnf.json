Even Brown Eyed Women totally rocked and the first set Sailor/Saint was a real treat.\n\nThis was also my favorite drums/space segment.  Airto broght some weird drums to the front of the stage and Micky and Billy followed.  Jerry eventually came out and jammed behind the drummers while Airto started some \"happy halloween\" chants.  The space jam went on until Phil came out and then it was St. Stephen time.  Stephen was played like the monster of a song that it was.  Throwing Stones was ok but Not Fade Away was played with emotion that carried on to the crowd chanting you know our love will not fade away.  Revolution was dessert after a great meal.  No one left this show unhappy.\n\nSmall indoor venue and a tough ticket to find.  These were also shows there were not on the dead hotline but word of mouth spread through the deadhead community to find out about these shows and many (including myself) found a connection to get into this show.  Probably my peak deadhead moment with only the Dark Star at the Greek and the 20th Anniv. shows at the Greek to even come close.",

This was the first time they had played St. Stephen in 8 years prior to this. No, not the last, but the first in along time...A special west coast treat. the whole audience all knew it was St. Stephen from the 1st note, and we were prepared kinda, because they had played it on the east coast a few days b4 this. I can hear myself on the tape scream-laughing. heheheheeeee!!! wow what a show. Hallowe'en @ Marin civic. I'll never forget this one. They played Stephen after this, but never like this.",

      "review_text": "Marin Civic-creme de la creme Old school 83' Halloween St. Stephen what a trip. I agree BEW rocks and Peggy-O- has a nice groove as far as Rooster, it was good with some nice energy but, it didn't sound like it was one of the best. I don't know maybe? Not a huge fan of Rooster the Brent solos were always my favorite part. These Oct. 83' and the spring 84 Marin shows are so awesome. A rariety for the Dead to play small cozy venues because of popularity the small intimate venues like Hult,Warfield or Augusta some others scattered about. Talk about gems, You can assume the band enjoyed that atmosphere as much as crowd, it fed off of one another which helps create that energy and vibe between both.\n ps The Mecca in Milwaukee 1989 was the closest I got to have seen the Dead in a small cozy venue. To this day its my favorite indoor show that I went to and listen to still now.",

      "review_text": "One Of The Best I was not there, but I had this particular tape of the second set for years. I played it so much that I could replay it in my head from front to back. I saved it twice form death by re-rolling it and splicing it with tape. I actually just found after these many years. In difference to what some other have written about this show. I beleive this to be ONE OF THE BEST SECOND SETS THEY EVER PLAYED MUSICALLY. Jerry and brent were clicking and phil is on top of his game. Help Slip Frank is perfect.  After going back and listening to all three St. Stephens of 83  this one is the best. The drums/ space are one of my all time favorite to listen to. The Jam going into Stephens is absolutley sick. It's like they loaded the gun and now they had to get it cocked and ready for firing. You can hear Phil turning up getting ready to drop bombs and Jerry doing the same. It's absolutley the best.",

      "review_text": "Saint StephEND The first set starts off nicely with a crowd pleasing decent Wang Dang Doodle which prepares the mass to have fun \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2All night long\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2. The first set really picks up with a twirling Brown Eyed Women (I love this song) then a break to a Lost Sailor into Saint Of Circumstance (Probably my favorite 80\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s continuation TWO GREAT BOBBY SONGS, Saint really gets the blood pumping) and from Saint Of Circumstance the band jammed into a classic first set ender Deal, nice version to. Second set is mind bending all the way through, starting with a traditional Help to Slipknot to Franklin\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s all marvelously done. A break to Estimated Prophet (which always puts me out of this world) perfectly jammed into an outstanding yet unusually fast Eyes Of The World. Coming out of space the band plays Saint Stephen for the last time live. The band played Saint Stephen three times in \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c283 and the last time before that was in \u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c279 so this was quite the treat for heads at this show. From Stephen the band goes into familiar 80\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s/90\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s territory with Throwing Stones then an end to this incredible set with Not Fade Away. Wow this show couldn\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2t get any better\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2 unless the band came out to close with a sensational cover of The Beatles \"Revolution\", and that\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s exactly what this crowd got. This show is a prime example of why I love the dead in the 80\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s, lots of material that can be covered, originals and covers.",

Therefore, it is hard for me to find audience shows that are of good enough quality for me to listen to without doing further damage to my hearing (by having to turn up the volume past 5 to even tell what song is being played!).  I am not saying anything about these shows except that as a person with major hearing lose, these are some of the shows that I have on my I-Pod.  Of course some are better than others.

      "review_text": "Too Much Fun One of the best - and most fun - shows I ever went to!  As I remember, there was a four ticket maximum mailorder with luck of the draw for assigned seating.  Luck of the draw - my buddies got four seats in 10th row from dead center to the right, and we got two seats in the same row with only a couple between us - who were more than happy to move over so we had six friends all together.  \n\nI did so much mescaline - I remember being in the bar during intermission and asking my friend Michelle if it was just me, or do they keep flashing the lights up and down.  Um, it's just you . . . \n\nAnd yes, we pretty much expected St Stephen since they had just played it back east.  And yes, as we awaited the encore I said the only thing they could possibly play was Revolution!\n\nComing outside afterwards we got a flyer for the as-yet unpublished Golden Road magazine; I sent a letter in with my subscription which was published as the first letter in the first issue (if I had thought it would be published I would have said something better).",

Reviving St. Stephen - while it seemed to overshadow the rest of the sets/songs - never did what Dark Star would do 6 years later at Hampton.\n\nThis was - to set the record straight - the final St. Stephen. Played twice as mentioned above, this one is tighter than the other 2. And what it may lack in \"Suprise\" it more than makes up for in execution.\n\nHelp>slip>franklin's is not too shabby either. Brown Eyed Women and Wang Dang have already been covered as standouts from the first set. \n\nTo tie this together - I think the reverence for the band bringing back St. Stephen has prevented this from being a D.P. or whatever the vault releases are called nowdays. \n\nI think (and again this is just MHO) that the Dark Star craze caused people to judge an entire show as 5 stars just b/c they played Dark Star.\nThis didn't happen w/ Stephen. \n\nGo back and listen to the 3 shows (10/11; 10/15 and this one) and see if you can pick up the X factor that may have been fueled by St.Stephen - but nevertheless existed in the songs and threads in the sets. \n\nGod Bless and Enjoy 4 and 1/2 stars",
