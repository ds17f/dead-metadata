I came out of the venue (which I remember to be the Paramount and not the coliseum), to find what I though was snow falling.  It was actaully ash.  I am thankful it didn't ruin our car engine on the 20-mile drive home.  I remember looking at my watch at the beginning of Fire and noting the time.  When I got home and watched the news, it was obvious the mountain blew about 5 minutes or so into Fire on the Mountain.",

After the first four songs or so I was danced out - and streching it already. When I left the show I thought it was snowing, and luckily, I only drove less than 10 miles to get a motel, rather than try to drive to the upcoming Seattle show. Seeing as how my dad lent me his best car, I'm glad I didn't try to get to Seattle. Rumor had it that a guy started for Seattle and burned up a Porsche motor. Just the other day there was a special on TV about Mt St Helens and they explained what would happen if a Jet Airplane flew through that ash - \"it's like finely chopped glass\" - great for an engine.",

However, I have been searching for it for some time and am glad to have located it because it was one of my favorite shows of all time (say of 50ish shows).  As for venue, definitely the Coliseum.  I stayed in the hotel right across the street (and was a bit of a regular there in those days).  As for whether it was \"snowing\" ash when people exited the show, not!  I went with my friend Larry to a nearby bar for a postshow beer only to find everyone watching the tv.  On the tube was a map of the area which showed the mountain and the path of the ash plume.  As the newscaster predicted, the ash began to fall sometime later.  We stocked up on beer and headed back to the hotel.  However, we were too twisted (does this cast my entire account in doubt?  I hope not) to use the covered parking and the next morning found my car covered in a grey glop.  Thankfully, it had rained during the night (no surprise since it was the Northwest) and we were able to drvie back to Seattle for the show the next night (which was also amazing).  By the way, I long thought (and wanted to believe) that the mountain erupted during FOTM.  Recently, I received a book as a gift from my youngest daughter, basically a chronological history of the Dead on a show by show basis.  Very cool.  According to this book, that is exactly what happened.  Cheers.  Uh-Oh.  Look out.  Mannix.  Pretty peggy.",

At 9:09 p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles (16 km) skyward.[32] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.[33] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 feet (60 m) and a width of 1,200 feet (370 m) within a week.[32]\n\nI was not there, but this one gets five stars...just because .....",

      "review_text": "Good, not great show Ill start by saying that I rarely, if ever, listen to anything from \u201980. Its kinda weird because I have no problem with \u201980, I just never seem to select it. At any rate, I thought this show was pretty damn good. Brent sounds great and everyone seems to be pretty much in sync this evening. If they actually knew about Mt. St Helens, I sure couldn\u2019t tell. The crowd, as usual, absolutely loved this one as well. The source was great and the vibe was awesome. \n\nThey kick this one off with a bang, ripping right into a smoking Alabama>Promised Land opener that fired the house right up nicely. Nice little opener right there boys, sweet! Next up Jerry slows it down with Peggy-O after a few technical difficulties, and this one was just a touch quicker than I prefer. I really liked it though, and Jerry\u2019s voice sounds nice and smooth this evening. Well done and flows nicely. I can tell I already like the feel of this show. Nothing crazy goin on yet they seem totally at ease tonight \u2013 and I love that shit. Bobby comes out with El Paso next and Jerry is literally all over the map. His noodling seems a bit faster than normal and there is something different about Bobby\u2019s rhythm as well. Start is a little off but they finish strong for sure. Respectable version for sure right there. BEW is pretty standard, but respectable as well. Again, a touch quick, but no too fast. Cassidy comes up next, and this is the best playing I have heard so far this evening. Brent\u2019s harmonies are a really nice accompaniment to Bobby \u2013 especially when he is not turned up too much. Really nice bit o\u2019 jamminess to this one as well. Quick, but still very good. They shoulda kept that vibe goin for a while \u2013 that abbreviated finish kinda sucked. Sounded like Jerry was just getting goin\u2019. Brent rolls out Far From Me next, which I\u2019m not a huge fan of, but this one was not too bad. He sounds strong and it was well played. Althea>Sailor>Saint up next, and I really liked Althea. Thought Jerry sounded great. Sailor I generally have hang-ups about \u2013 and I think most of it stems from using Dark Star in the lyrics. That just pisses me off for some reason. AND, the song is kinda cheesey imo. Saint is always enjoyable, and Bobby does this one justice. Nothing off the charts, but good none then less. Standard issue Deal with some serious nutiness towards the end closes out the set and that is that. \n\nI like this show so far and just sounds like it was fun to be there. Its more of a Rock and Roll show without the trippyness from years before or speedball express that would be coming in the next few years. I think it might just be the period as well. Even with a few songs I didn\u2019t really care for, I dug this first set. Damn good listen. The boys sound in sync and are playing well. \n\nSecond set starts out with Drums for a couple minutes, and then they find there way into the second set opener which is actually the entire set - Scarlet Begonias> Fire On The Mountain> Estimated Prophet> Drums> Not Fade Away> Black Peter> Around & Around> Good Lovin. Scarlet comes on strong and when Jerry starts his soloin\u2019 he sounds like he\u2019s having just a touch of trouble with feedback and whatnot, but once that shit is straightened out \u2013 it\u2019s a little off again and on again, and he does quite a bit of screwing around lower on the register which is pretty unique. By the second verse the crowd is in an absolute frenzy. He then beefs it up with a little wah for good measure, and then switches back and forth which was also pretty cool. This one definitely grows on you about half way through. Pretty furious little extended jam from Jer towards the end which morphs into a very nice little version of Fire. Kinda cool little transition as it was short, Jerry was flying at the end of Scarlet \u2013 and then just dropped in to that phat reggae groove. Jerry is doing some great stuff that I haven\u2019t really heard before this show tonight. He\u2019s doing like this light speed playing thing, for like a minute, then laying totally off, and then jumping right back and blasting away. Nice job hippy. This one is ramping nicely. Back to the beefcake wah, back to the speedy nuttiness, and we are ready for our next transition into Estimated, which actually, was no transition at all. Anyhow, Estimated fires up and you can hear Brent barely on top of Jerry\u2019s licks, which in general, really gets under my skin. In this case however, Brent gets a pass for his remarkable playing and trading with Jerry a little further down the line. This is definitely a Brent heavy Estimated, and its also one of the better Brent era Estimated\u2019s I have heard. They work this one almost like a Dark Star where they basically take you all the way down to nothing, start spacing a little, and then work their way out. Great freakin job boys! Wow, this one\u2019s got some oomph for damn sure! Really, really nice work from Brent here, some of his best this reviewer has ever heard. They do a little spacin\u2019 out here with a jump into drums, and from there they fuse it right into NFA after doing an almost Fire sounding tease. Very cool turn they take when they finally go full on NFA. Very funky start to this one, never really heard one like it before. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call this one slow, but it is a little slower \u2013 and Jerry comes on with a BANG after the first go round. Nice patient soloing and a great feel. This one is awesome. Very unique. Really nicely jammed on the way out as well. This melts right into a wonderful Peter. Jerry tells this tale with all the emotion you could want, and the crowd just eats it up. Its kinda funny cause the crowd tries to clap along with the slow time and keeps missing(you guys know how hard that shit is to do while dosed  ), but to their credit they keep it up for most of the tune. Nice Peter right there! Really liked that one. Round and Round is up next and is pretty standard, and they finish this one off with a full tilt Good Lovin\u2019. The encore is JBG(ehh) and that is that. \n\nThoughts on this one as a whole\u2026.The second set was much better than the first with some unique jamming I have not really heard anything like before, especially during Fire, Estimated and NFA. The first set had its moments also (Alabama>Promised Land, Cassidy), but nothing to out of the ordinary I suppose - yet still very good. I really enjoyed this show. It was a great listen and it just plain sounded like a good time. I love shows like this where everything just seems to flow so well. It may not have had so many highs, yet it maintained a great vibe the whole time. They really did not reach too awful far this evening, yet they were definitely not off either. I am recommending this show and I am giving it a solid B+. Yet another great show to play the non GD fan who is interested in the sound.",

When we walked out, the 'rain' felt very weird.  In a second, I realized it was dry!  Ash, not rain!  It fell for hours after the show.  Next day we drove to Seattle.  After the show, someone took the phone off the hook...I missed my wake up call...saw my plane fly away, missing grad ceremonies...so, why not go to Spokane?  What a trip!",

It's a reference to a star that sailors used to navigate, I believe in the southern hemesphere.  In the song the sailor is lost and cannot find his way: \"where is the dog star?\"  I did not know this for years and it too bugged me.  I love the song though.  For me it's got that lush sound at the begining that alway got me when it would start.  God I miss seeing them.",
