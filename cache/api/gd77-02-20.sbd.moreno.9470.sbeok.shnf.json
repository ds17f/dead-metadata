The only difference is the 2/17 version has the three outakes from Mars (\"Unbroken\",\"Cucamonga\", and \"Money, Money\"). I almost downloaded both of these, so i thought id post this before someone else did the same thing.\nIt is a really fun outakes cd though, I really enjoy the Mars outakes the most. Most of us know that the GDead did there magic live, but it is always fun to hear studio stuff, just dont be dissapointed if your mind isnt blown in two:)\n\ndarkstr56",

Am i correct with this corralation?\n\nB. If so , and 3/18/77 was the exception to the rule , what was actually played that evening was the Terrapin Transit instrumental section ,At A Siding (withouth the lyrics) and a portion of Terrapin Flyer that lead into drums . \n\nHeres my grudge ..lol...\nWhy on earth is this labeled as Alahambra , and the show that is posted on the site here has over a minutes worth of the end of Terrapin in the drums file. So to hear the song in its entirty from that evenning , download  Terrapin , Alahambra and Drums - listen to it , and listen to the album. It all matches up , section by section , and somehow became labeled Alahambra. \n\nby the way i think it stinks this entire song was not played live more than once. The lyrics on At A Siding are great and the instrumentals rock - its right up there on my **Why did they never bring back Ripple or St. Steven** wish list.",

What does performing Terrapin have to do with performing another song? If they wanted to play Equinox they would have. Why would the lyrics of another tune have any impact on performing a different tune? That makes no sense to me, as a musician by trade.",

My understanding is that Phil thought that song was sucked. Well, for my part, in this version, I hear riffing on that \"Station Man\" theme throughout. This is different from other/later versions of \"Passenger\".",

I think What'll you Raise was on that tape too. Hunters Version of Terrapin goes on forever. There's no way Garcia was going to pick up that whole thing. It's still a shame that they only played the whole thing that one time. Also, the main reason why there are so many parts to Terrapin, and I know that you guys all know this little bit of trivia anyway, is because they had to deliver a certain amount of songs to Arista to complete their obligation for the album. Terrapin parts, same as Anthem of the Sun parts. Thats it for The Other one, quadlibet for tenderfeet, etc...",

      "review_text": "Terrapin Suite Really grateful stuff like this is up on the archive. The full Terrapin Suite alone in gives all the reason anyone would ever need to listen to this recording. While some of today's bands have excellent full versions of part one of the Terrapin Station Suite,( and I've found a single performer who does play the second part of the Suite with Hunters endorsement however it does not incorporate the first part of the work whatsoever leaving no single piece too include both parts of the suite in full by any performer)  the omission to include later parts in live performance's by the band is something that leaves me at a loss? \nWas there ever a formal explanation of this from anyone in the band? Does anyone out there really know why the band didn't try to incorporate these segments into performance's? If anyone knows ...\nOther highlights include just about every other track. This is the kind of nugget that makes this archive such a valuable resource for us. I'm not shameless pitching for donations but support of the archive is what will keep it around for everyone to be able to access all this great stuff. Imagine having to seek out everything through the mailing lists and in lot like before the internet. And here we have it all now at the touch of a fingertip instant gratification.",
