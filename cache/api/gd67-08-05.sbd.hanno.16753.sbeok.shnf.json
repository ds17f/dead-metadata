It seems like if you stay in the penta minor and give it a blues feel you can do no wrong. The first of many great lovelights to come. God bless Pigpen! I think he helped Jerry dig deep and tap into that eternal soul. If you listen to the studio tracks from 65 in San Fran (Early Morning Rain) you can clearly hear that Pig was an obvious influence on Jerry vocally. The Alligator is jamin too. Bravo!",

Driving energy, free-form psychedelic jamming, always moving forward, a true ensemble working together. Alligator was relatively new when they played this gig, but the band is very comfortable with it.\n\nDeadbase lists this as the first Turn on Your Lovelight. It could be wrong, but not by much. This Lovelight is a goodie, with Pigpen and Jerry tearing up the place.",

Apparently she lived in Toronto or near there and knew that the Dead covered her song (she had heard and enjoyed the version on the band's debut album).  She made it to the one of the shows but unfortunately they didn't play Dew that night (they had played it the previous night).  She thought they were pretty great, regardless. ;)",
