The music at this show in particular is on par with other shows of the era. It was also interesting to hear the taper get shut down by someone in the dead organization, pity it was during an interesting New Speedway Boogie. All in all, the show ain't perfect, but how many really were? Thanks to the archive, we have some of the shows that were not in wide circulation over the years. This one is at least worth a listen.",

Workingman's Dead had gotten some airplay on the alternative FM station in Philly, but most of us were there that day to see Hendrix.  Also on the bill was Cactus.  So these strange looking white guys bounce out on stage with cowboy hats, and about 200 people upfront are  jumping up and down from the get go.  Curious..They played for less than an hour, but it was wonderful, joyous music, particularly in comparison to the dark pain that Hendrix produced later that day, only a few days before he died.",

Jerry's guitar comes across very clear on this tape, but the vocals are a bit low and the music kinda muddy. It's almost like having a Grateful Dead kareoke (I know - I butchered that word) take. We know all the words, so let's just sing along!",

I was 14 years old and we stood outside the house with our (older) neighbors listening to this concert. It was SO LOUD and I do mean \"LLLLOOOOOUUUUUDDD\" that we could hear it quite clearly from that distance. I can't say I remember too much about The Dead's part of the show, but have a vivid memory of Jimi Hendsix playing The Star Spangled Banner, Purple Haze, and Foxy Lady. My parents friends who lived down the street from Temple Stadium (which was located in the Olney section, a residential neighborhood) had 6 TV's on full volume in one room and couldn't hear a thing! It was the first, last, and only concert ever held at that venue - Frank Rizzo, the infamous Chief Of Police (and future Mayor) of Philadelphia also lived in that neighborhood and made certain to prevent a repeat of what he had termed a \"hippie catastrophe\". Ah, the memories....",

When tickets for this concert came up, I ran downtown after work and bought two. Cactus was the opening band, then Steve Miller, Jimi Hendrix, and the Dead played a really long set to close.  Tickets were cheap, maybe $15 if I remember correctly. \n\nIt was a warm, clear day. The concert was excellent. A very good time was had by all. The Philly Cops closed the gates and stood outside the stadium never coming in to the crowd.  That was comforting.  \n\n If you missed the 60's, there's no way we can explain it to you. ",
