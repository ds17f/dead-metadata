Snappy drumming and some amazing flamenco interplay make this sound like a Clint Eastwood/Lee Van Cleef gunfight. (97 pts)",

This tape is definitely from 1/27, since at the end, you can faintly hear Garcia saying, \"See you next time we're in Seattle.\" (This was their last Seattle date on that tour.) \nThe \"1/23\" jam cuts off just as the Spanish theme is heating up. 1/27 picks up at almost the same point in the music, with apparently little missing (though there is a gap there, probably a reel change). \nIt's true that the total makes for a very long Spanish jam (at over 18 minutes, by far the longest of the tour) - but consider, it's the last song of the show, and they do seem to be dragging it out quite a bit. The length includes a fair bit of space - and the next longest Spanish jam, from 1/17, also comes at the end of a set. \nThe biggest argument against the match is the different sound mix. But the sonic difference isn't that great - one listener found that the 1/27 tape has the stereo image reversed from the \"1/23\" tape. Simply switch left to right when you compare sources, and they're much more similar.",

Can anyone say \"reel flip?\" This is a clearer tape, though... less wear.",

Rate the music, not the freaking date!?!?! By all means, have these probably very interesting (to some) discussions about what time it is in the review box. For instance, how do we know that 1/27/68 as we know it now was really 47 years ago today? Maybe the earth swung too close to a wormhole that year and so it was really 47.348 years or 29.956 years ago! You don't know: or if we could know, then how? Even if we could know how, does it affect the experience of the sublime gained from lstening to this Spanish Jam? No! It freaking doesn't! In relation to time, the experience of the sublime re Spanish Jam exists a priori (from the very beginning, i.e. BEFORE TIME). So we could have that discussion too, but I still wouldn't let that affect how I would rate the performance by these musicians of this Spanish Jam. Am I alone in this? Why do you think there was anybody at this concert: to experience the concert, or to know what time it was?",
