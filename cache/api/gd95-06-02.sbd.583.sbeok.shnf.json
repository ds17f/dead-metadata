      "review_text": "At least the monks are good! I hate giving Dead shows bad reviews but it's hard to be positive about this one. The sound quality on this is indeed very good, but the performance itself is extremely lacking. \n\nThe 1st set starts off bad, with Garcia putting Alabama Getaway through the mincer in every aspect. However the worst comes in Birdsong, which starts off well, but after a few minutes Jerry seems to lose all concentration, which in turn results in a further 12 minutes of sheer mess. The highlight of the set is perhaps Schoolgirl, though Garcia has minimal input, Weir does a fine job holding it together. The 2nd Set is not much better. New Speedway Boogie (which they usually managed to pull off quite well in '95) and He's Gone are totally unemotional, and TWBS just sounds more like a mess-around jam. WTG is just a bore on everyone's part and by the time they get to Saint Of Circumstance you can really hear them tiring of the situation. Post space is, though not bad as far as playing is concerned, very lack-lustre, even for a '95 show, and SOTM is a very sad example of poor Jerry's state at the time. \n\nOn the good side however, the Guyoto Monks' chant inbetween Drums and Space is an interesting little moment, and probably the best part of the evening. If this show proves anything it is that by this stage in the bands history, Weir was seriously covering for Garcia's short fallings in his much more active-than-usual guitar playing.\n\nCollectors Only.",

      "review_text": "Jerry sings strong This show, like so many from it's era, is difficult to review in clasic criteria because at this point in the deads career Jerry did sound more like he did in '85 than even '87-'92. I was at this particular show- I remember driving in from Santa Cruz- missed the last night of the run however. \n\nJerry sings like a prophet who knows the end is near. I have no other way of explaining it. In those times I would always go to shows as often as possible full well knowing that JG's energy could waver from show to show- but the rest of the band was energetic but for me, they always seemed to feed off JG anyway, so he was important to the dead's energy from night to night.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is that this show is a great recording. SOTM is sung with great passion and JG is doing the best he can at the time, which is touching and to me the essence of what the dead was about. It was the greatest Garage band and always jammed out. This show technically doesnt sound terrific but to me that is okay. The guys don't get A+'s for singing class but so what? Jerry gives it his best shot and I remember him screaming at the top of his lungs during SOTM. \n\nEverything else in the show is decent stuff,songs like Schoolgirl and speedway were classics and Schoolgirl was all up in tempo- it was not 1969- but it is the dead and this run at Shoreline was my last ever so I downloaded it: June 3rd the next night is great too and was my last show. I may not have downloaded it if not for the sentimental value actually. \n\nHaving listened to it though, it is a solid 2 sets from 1995 but I have to agree with the previous  writer that this is for collectors only. Jerry souds like he has a cold and is a little nasaly at one point; I think he was even getting a little emotional durring SOTM. \n\nI give this sow a 5 for sound but only a 3.5 for overall rating- so I will give a 3 here- as an impartial rating since it was my last show.",

It was also the first time I had heard El Paso since the early 70's...what a treat...always one of my favorites.\n\nAnd what can I say...the Gyoto Monks were unbelievable. \n\nListen to this show carefully...it was not your typical show...but it was special...and a forebearing of things to come.",

I disagree with the earlier comments about Birdsong being a complete mess.  As a fan of Ornette Coleman, I'd always wanted the band to push that song as far as possible...and this night, they did.  I recall the melody, then the key, then then rhythm completely falling apart into some very free music.  They pulled it back together admirably, and it remains one of my favorite versions.  Not much else to recommend about the show, but I had fun.",

      "review_text": "Wish I had gone... This show has enormous sentimental value for me because in fact \"I did not go\" and I wish so very much that I had! I had just gotten back to the SF Bay Area from overseas, just in time for the shows in the region, but I flaked! I had not any energy nor the financial means. Though when I heard the second set of this show years later for the first time, it struck me so clearly that I just should have been there.. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING! So groovy.. Contrary to criticism by some, this show sounds superb to me (I just should have gone no matter what..) Little did I know, this Shoreline series would have been my last.. Makes me teary in the eyes and in the heart.. \n\nAs for the music, sentiments aside, I think this is just an excellent show, considering this is the post-sixties, jazzy-Dead era. \"That Would be Something\" has the coolest groove that is Dead's signature, \"Way to go home\" is allright if you can pan out the screaming vocals down a bit. \"He is Gone\" on the other hand is very powerful and has a great vocal jam in the end. It peaks the groove for me into the drum jam.. Jazzy and rocking groovy at the same time.. Besides, you really can't seperate the sentiments with the music, in my opinion, because the Grateful Dead's music is afterall essentially sentimental.\n\nThanks for putting this great show on the archive. Unfortunutely, I only get to hear it through my strereo and did not witness the energy which must have been there at Shoreline. As some of you suggest, it must have been something. The last time I got to see The Dead and JGB remained the end of 94 because I missed this show. I have a feeling from there on I would have gotten on the bus and followed the band till the end, all the way to Chicago. It makes me teary in the eyes and in the heart.\n\nSafe journeying to you all...",

It shows the band breaking out (or at least mastering) two different arrangements, one for Schoolgirl, and the other for New Speedway.  Along with some of the other \"new\" stuff the band was working on (i.e. Take Me To the River, It's All Too Much, Visions of Johanna), it's easy to speculate about the directions the band would have gone in had Jerry not passed.  IF they toured less, IF Jerry got help, IF Vince had a better handle on the music, IF IF IF ..it's a bit of a bummer, but this is a decent show.  Check out the out there jam about 7 minutes into Bird Song, the Gyoto chanting and LSD.  Not too shabby.  This is really 3.5, but I always round up.",

I had friends who would sit for darkstar...WTF???  So..anyway....i was there..never missed a shorline show--but this one was special.  Except that they totally screwed up the parking for this event..and made people walk miles to the old booty lot......this show was pure DEAD magic!  I got into the soundcheck, and i swear they warmed-up a cosmic charlie.  this band, if jerry hadn't left so suddenly, was about to break a bunch of knock-out hits.  I know they were warming it up for this show...maybe another soon.  That never got to happen, unfortunately.  But waht did happen that night was amazing. There was a weird energy...and it was contemplative to say the least.  This show wasn't as much of a rocker as a soul-searcher.  You gotta hear it as a story instead of a party.  maybe then you'll get it.  I photo'd this night and was right up front....and during this amazing standing on the moon....Jerry closed his eyes through the entire song, never opening them from my point of view.  He seemed to almost wince in pain singing this song and i know i saw an occasional tear from the corner of Jerry's eyes.  He really felt this night....it was plain in his face, for all to read.  He was carrying his ol' burden at this show...u could tell, and it was a deep trip.  He let us out alive...but it wasn't long for him afterward.  When hearing it now, i detect the warnings.....as if Jerry was saying \"Yeah, you may hate this, but I know u rider....gonna miss me when i'm gone.............\"  This show was a slice of what made the dead experience, and so often, that was not a smoking or perfect set--  It was life....full of the ups and downs that make us human.  This show was equal to the 'real' Dead experience....a mountain of emotion....and not all can be pretty.  Indeed, at this show, some got raw.",

Guess you should've joined the band if you wanted to make these decisions.  As for a Deadhead since 91 OF COURSE YOU CAN BE IMHO(listen to older HEads  you can always learn something) you can be a DeadHead starting last week ...if you get it and can get one the proverbial bus. Oh the show...FUN...perfect??? HELL NO. but that's the beauty of the DEAD",

      "review_text": "That would be something... ...if this darkness would give. I don't usually feel the need to comment but the spirit has moved me. So many people have touched on so many important points in this discussion. It amazes me how people can hear, witness, feel, and otherwise experience the same thing and come up with so many different interpretations of it. We can listen for technical precision, vocal prowess, creative genius, emotion, etc... Some come to laugh the past away and some come to make it just one more day but whichever way your pleasure tends, if you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind. \n\nFor some reason, this little show that few have heard of has, I think, touched on the heart of what it is to be a deadhead. I have to agree with some that this is not the show to turn your friends into deadheads and is technically poor. The drummers do sound off at times, which is unusual, and Jerry does his almost ritual lyric fudging. Alabama is certainly slow. But it is not a slow show. In fact, GMLSG hits the quickest pace I've heard and harkens to Muddy Waters's original version. \n\nI will agree with others that this show is about magic. I have been a Deadhead for, oh my, 13 years; I just missed Jerry, in fact my first memory of the Dead after being kicked a couple shows by my cousin was of hearing the sad news of Jerry's passing. That said, I KNOW this band and I FEEL them, even outside the venue, tucked away in my little room, and fourteen years away from this show, I feel them This show, with all it's flaws, is rowdy, spiritually speaking. \n\nAs much as I dislike this version of Alabama you can hear from the start that Jerry is improvising vocals, which he does not often do, and the solo on GSET is unusually loud and ferocious for 1995. I haven't even heard SOTM yet and by GMLSG I know this show is special. It is in no way the same as the love I have for a crisp and electric late 70s SBD but it is a mature, thoughtful, and brooding love for a band that can exhibit more depth and raw emotion in one night than some people experience in an entire year.  Albeit deeply flawed, this show is deeply special and the flaws actually are what make this show so emotional; for what is a jam without tension,  triumph without hardship, or a Dead show without some glaring imperfection?\n\nSorry for the lengthy post. I'm done.\n\nPeace y'all,\nJamestowne",

Neither is Vince and their aleatoric \"free\" jazz fumbling is not rewarding. Bobby tries to bring the band some tonal center and does some fast lead work but to no avail. Sloppy indifferent playing characterizes this show. I'm not feeling it.",

Absolutely stunning rendition that gives you everything. Too often this one gets abbreviated or exists as an awkward landing pad, this one shines on its own and is given plenty of space to wrench your guts with emotion. \nFour star show as there's fun renditions of GSET, Schoolgirl, El Paso and TWBS. Classic Ramble and Bird Songs and the perfect SOTM. Jerry is electric throughout with the band on all cylinders, especially Vince. You can keep the chanting, it is interesting at best and not a must hear. ",

      "review_text": "Well, they liked Shoreline And/or obviously felt good on this evening, because the music is clicking and the band sounds great. Jerry and everybody. Here, this is one of those 95 soundboards that sounds really pure. Jerry's guitar Sounds full and it's back to the original tones if then some that he last had a 92 before the sounds changed a lot in 93 in the 94. I feel like 95 was the year they got their sound back and if Jerry could have rallied healthwise they would have had another era of cool sound in their evolution from 95 to 96. This is one of the best shows you can listen to to hear with that 9596 sound was going to be like.\n\nOne thing the dead do not shy away from during 95 is wacky mixed up set lists, and long extended a tonal psychedelic breakdown jams. On this show, they unleash It On Us in the first set during a 15 minute bird song. It really really gets out there and, I don't understand why people want to compare 95 dead or any year dead for that matter to another year dead. You can only listen to one at a time! So for me, it's all about does that particular show have something interesting to it, it doesn't really matter how it Compares up to other shows. You can just rate it on its own merits I truly believe.\n\nI give this star four and a half stars for playing not because it's not a five-star played show but they could have done a better set list for how good they were playing that's all. Five stars for sound quality",
