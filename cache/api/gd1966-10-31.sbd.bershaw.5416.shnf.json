Neither the phrasing of the guitar nor the bass line sound anything like Jerry or Phil, and the beat's waaay too fast for that era's GD. They moved pretty consistently back & forth between straight-ahead electric blues and the white-boy SF harmonies (a la Jefferson Airplane) at the time. Viola Lee Blues bridges the two pretty nicely, which is why it's one of the standouts of the era. In my humble opinion, that is... :-D",

Various MP's kept interrupting and fiddling with the sound and mics during their performance, so they quit and left. After that, the Pranksters themselves took up their instruments and began to play. This is probably the AAofA, but the harmonica makes me think that it may be the Pranksters, late in the evening. I really don't know, since I wouldn't be born for another 11 years anyway. Just my 2 cents...   (2)http://www.pranksterweb.org/grad.htm",

A bit too much \"noise\" for me, which is why I think the Dead strayed away from this as the '70's grew nearer. Would've loved to hear more from this... Some Neal Cassady banter would be nice.\n\nDid you pass the Acid Test?",

Also, the Dead were advertised to be playing at California Hall (Polk St. in San Francisco) for a Halloween costume dance ball called Dance of Death. A poster for the show is here: http://www.concertpostergallery.com/concertposters/wp-content/uploads/1237340680dance-largest.jpeg. The only Halloween of their 60's era on a Monday was 1966. ",
