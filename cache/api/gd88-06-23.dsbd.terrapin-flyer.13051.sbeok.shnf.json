I thought I was to be disappointed when Iko made it's first set appearance.  What a wonderful way to dry one's eyes coming out of Believe It, when Women popped up.\nThe Dew and Brokedown stand for themselves.

Ramrod comes onstage and she sees him point, thinking it was to sit down. She just stared at Jerry and he is leaning back, looking down at her, digging in hard, with a big smile on his face. I do think there was something in the punch that day. Crazy Dew, best I ever saw. Best show of the 4, possible best show of that leg of the summer tour.",

I consider this summer the last great Dead tour.It has great sentimental value for some of us that had been out there since the early 70's. I met my wife on this tour at Saratoga. From the blistering heat, to the piles of hail that looked like snow on the road in Maine we drove the Terrapin bus,the Rabbit,the Buick,the Chevy wagon, good gosh! The road just kept rolling.We were at Alpine for 6 nights, two of the days were 104f-105f back to back. The chilled cantalope filled with ice cream at the Lake Vienna diner may haved saved my life...nah,I have never had or heard this show on tape. I listened to Poky and it smoked. When I heard the \"Belive It or Not\" I broke into tears. So many memories. So many roads. So many good friends gone. So much of life passes by as we raise our kids and try to survive in a cruel profit driven world. My daughter is now 10 years older than I was when I saw my first show. Last night my two young sons and I danced a tribal stomp in the living room while listening to Rotterdam 72( yeah, mom was at work). But this show seemed to bring so much emotion back. \"Belive it or Not\", It's so typical Dead it could have been a \"Pig\" number. Now that the lads are gone I've started playing my drums again as my musical outlet. Pushing 50 and still playing the blues! but I will never forget this tour. The band seemed re-energized after some ...Ok I'll say it,Lame years. The scenes were huge but we made a last effort to impose the \"old hippie\" self governmant ethos it almost worked and did succeed in maintaining a purpose driven vibe especially at this venue.Remember cosmic recycylers,Micky in the clown suit and other band members out in the crowd/jungle. I wish I could go back. I love the archive and thank you for it. God Bless you all. Peace. We can still change the world. Think about it. Lets do it! Slante!",

The boys are content to provide chill music. \"Stagger\" flows nicely and is expressive if not forceful. \"Masterpiece\" has that Sunday afternoon 'drive' tone...All night, Bobby's rhythm guitar has been a little sour and off. \"Bird\" is again pleasing, but nothing soars higher than rolling hills. The mellow set concludes with a lazy loose skiffle of a \"Promised.\" \n\n2nd Set: A call to festivities \"Hey Pocky\" opens up the final of eight sets from the Valley of Alpine. Tonight is the commencement of the less than two year life span of \"Believe it or Not.\" It's a direct plea to a potential lover that despite his/her doubts the singer is committed to the blossoming of the relationship. Unfortunately, the insular quality of the tale and the undistinguishable melody hardly ever allows the song to reach a transcendental point. \"Man Smart\" is keen but nothing blisters -  it's all nicely performed without rough edges or genuine excitement. \"He's Gone\" is a pretty straight-forward rendition. Some interesting tones and rhythms seemingly out of 'Cats' extenuate interest in a long \"Drums\" segment. \"Space\" feels slightly dirty leading to a Bobby cheesefest \"Miracle\" that continues the vibe of a good time without authentic drama (hear that Bobby, authentic, non-artificialized) keen outro moments around 3:05. More shakey's during \"Gimme.\" \"Watchtower\" is enjoyable but doesn't grunge as hard as some better versions from earlier in the year, and '87. The \"Dew\" crunches harder and is at a three and a half star rate whereas the rest of the show is at three. The climax builds to a noisy crescendo, but it's a bit muddled and not really worthy of a show-ender. \nWe're encoring tonight with..oh my, that sounds like an acoustic strumming of \"Blackbird.\" Their voices are not melding well on this recording...someone's distortion effects are quite distracting. Brent giggles after coming in early to the last verse....which causes the whole band to mildly chortle their way through the early 2's...the reprise is unnecessary... Because the music was at a minimal they easily stroll into a show-closing sweet lullabye \"Brokedown.\" \n\n3 1/8 stars",

      "review_text": "a special show for me Overall: A much more solid night than the night before.  This was my favorite night of the run.  Healey was apparently, as others have noted, adding a stupid flange effect the vocals (and instruments at times), but if you listen to the audience recording (as opposed to this soundboard) it actually kind of fits with the acoustics created by that huge Alpine roof.  It definitely takes away from the peformance, but it's not horrible and you get used to it, plus its not as prominent in the second set.  Aside from that, the song selection is really fantastic and the playing is mostly solid and at times great.  One interesting note - Bobby loses his place rhythmically several times during this show, either falling one beat ahead or behind the song (Masterpiece, Bird Song, Women R, etc.), which cracks me up.  \n\nThe scene: the dust bowl coming to a close.  After the show, Frank and I split ASAP and drove all night to get back for our high school graduation.  I used to have a funny picture of Frank with his head back against the passenger seat of the bus, asleep, and a really beautiful sunrise in the background.  The school didn't want to let us participate in the graduation ceremony, ostensibly because we hadn't attended the rehearsal.  In reality, they were just pissed because we skipped half our finals to go to these Alpine shows, but our grades were still good enough to graduate (that really ticked them off).  But this night brought to a close our first run of Alpine shows and was special for me in a few different ways.  \n\nThe music: Set I: A decent Aiko is always a good way to start an evening.  Roses is just rare enough to be special (I seem to recall never hearing it more than once a tour) and this is a beautiful version, even with Healey's vocal effects.  Masterpiece>Bird Song>Promised Land is one of my favorite first set song blocks.  The jam on this Bird Song is definitely unique, although it rides that fine line between disjointed and \"out there.\"  \n\nSet II: Hey Pockey Way continues the outstanding song selection for the evening, and Brent's working hard to get you off your ass and shake that thang.  Believe it or Not continues the nightly new song parade for this Alpine run.  I think this song faded away soon after its debut because Standing on the Moon (which debuted less than a year later) sort of had a similar vibe and it was, frankly, a better song.  Women R Smarter gets everybody dancing again, with some nice moments from Brent.  He's Gone was really special for me this night.  On the day we left for Alpine our friend Nick died in a car accident.  Frank and I didn't find out until the 21st when we called some friends to give them the set list updates for the first couple of shows.  So when they started playing this, I sat over by the little group of trees on the far Phil side and cried a little.  I'd known Nick since elementary school, but only been friends with him the last couple of years - mostly because he lived in the same neighborhood as Bill P, so we all wound up hanging out.  The week after Alpine, he was supposed to move into the apartment on Alliance Ave (with Aaron, Larry, and Jaime) that I moved into that fall when I got back from fall tour.  This is a decent version with a somber little jam afterward.  Drums has a lot of intresting sounds and instrumentation on this evening.  Miracle>GSL>Watchtower is another favorite song-block of mine and this one is played really well.  Dew is awesome.  Jerry really wails out some lyrics and Phil churns out some big chords at one point as well.  There are two very nice peaks to it.  Blackbird encore??  This one blew me away.  It had some really special meaning for me personally because I was embarcing on my first full tour, I was graduating from high school with so much ahead of me, and this was my first trip in the new VW that would be my home periodically for a few years while out on the road.  In sum, I \"was only waiting for this moment to arrive.\"  This was the first of only two \"attempts\" at Blackbird (they screwed up both pretty well).  It was a complete surprise to me at the time, but astute listeners might not have been so surprised.  At the beginning of the second set on 4/8/88 Jerry played a full couple of lines of this song before they started the set.  Brokedown is always my favorite of the slow-tune encores.  To this day it still reminds me of falling asleep with my walkman on as a 15 year-old kid listening to Dead Set.",

I've been reading a lot of the reviews out there and I'm a little dismayed at how much they focus on quality, whether the boys were on, set selection, etc...  For me, a show like this will always be priceless because it captures time.  I listen to this Alpine run and remember all the little things that, together with the music, make up my experience on tour.  This was my first \"real\" tour. I bought a one-way plane ticket to Minnesota and relied on that unwritten etiquette, where no one is left behind, to get back East.  I remember finding that little stream, just outside the fence, where the few who knew about it found respite from the heat.  It was here that I really began to make the deep connections with other heads that, post-Jerry, I miss and try to re-establish today.  I remember the turf spikes we found and piled up by the speakers on the hill (or was that '89 during the rains?) and the bogus opium peddled in the lot. The lucky campsites amidst the trees and spending the first night sleeping on the gravel underneath a school bus after having been separated from my ride, with no shoes or any gear. \n     All I had really brought with me that summer was the belief, NO, the knowledge that I was SUPPOSED to BE there.

My personal favorites are within the 2nd set: Hey Pocky Way and one of Jerry's most emotional singing I've ever heard in Believe it or Not.  And of course the sheer fun of Blackbird.  I've had an audience tape for years and wished I could get a better copy.  I heard this soundboard tape for the first time and said UGHHH!, I'll go back to my audience tape.  The vocal flanging was very distracting, it especially made them seem like they were singing off-key during Women are Smarter, but most of all, I really miss the audience's cheers during Believe it or Not. To me that felt as much a part of this emotional song as Jerry's singing itself.\nI know audience noise can be distracting much of the time, but for this song in particular it seemed to definitely add to the song.",

      "review_text": "Brent Was awesome as a back up singer or helper in alot of Bobby songs like Stranger, Rooster,Women Are Smarter, Midnight Hour and you get the point. Kind of trading off lines or repeating verses. Sharing a song with Phil. There was nobody better. He was the man on the keys also but lead singer he was not, sorry. Maybe Mr Fantasy but I cant think of any other song that makes me go wow I have to hear that again and again. I can listen to Jerry blow the words on Terrapin a 1000 times and not get sick of it. Sorry I love Brent and wished he was still around but a lead singer he was not.",

      "review_text": "Jboy must die! Just kidding, I found his reviews annoying (a kind of low-rent version of Greil Marcus, another individual who's writing I can't stand), so I just skip 'em. However, I fully support Jboy's right to post reviews, and feel they should be available for anyone who would care to read them.\nI also have to post a quick opinion on any given review style. I don't particularly care to read stories about people's fond memories of the show, or tour stories, good or bad (some have been interesting, though). A reviewer below expressed consternation at why everyone is so focused on \"quality\"??? My answer to that would be, \"what else is there?\" Would you use this show to try to get someone into the Dead who hadn't heard them? Would someone who wasn't there and didn't have the fond memories you do come back to this one for repeated listening? Again, anyone can write and post reviews in any style and from any angle they want. I'm just throwing out my opinion, so keep those stories comin' (I'll just skip those parts.....lol).\nFor this show, I'd say, \"yes\" (at least to question #2). Strong from start to finish (except for Blackbird). Jerry's vocals are heartfelt and passionate, and sounding as sweet as it was possible for him to sound at this stage of the game. While Blackbird is more or less shabby and unrehearsed, the fact that you can feel the good mood of the band (along with the novelty/rarity factor) make it fun. I'll admit it sounded way better to me on the night they played it than just now. Plus, they threw in a sweet Brokedown for a bonus. Believe It Or Not could be a \"best version ever\", and the rest of the show ranges in the \"better than average\" to \"great\" category (except Blackbird, but there are mitigating circumstances, in my opinion). Stream the soundboard, download the audience if you need to own it. Best night of the 88 Alpine run. 4+ stars, rounded up to 5.",

The strangeness of the sound you hear comes from the SBD feed, and is on any SBD copy of this show circulating. \nNeed a time machine to correct it....\n\nGreat setlist, fun show...

      "review_text": "Lovely I only found this show b/c of the \"this day in Dead history\" link, which I'm using more and more these days. Great show, very listenable, would kill for a Matrix of this.\n\nAll the other reviewers have covered what's so good--and not so good--about the show. Even though the mid-80s to early-90s was when I went to shows, I'm not too nostalgic about those days and prefer the earlier stuff ('68-'74 mainly), but every now and then I hear something from this era, and I get choked up. I was not at this show, but the sound is very familiar to me, this era and setlist, and this is a fine example. Oh how I miss them...I become a bigger fan with each passing year, and wish I'd felt more comfortable with the scene at the time and could have seen more shows (well, I could have, but usually declined. Silly me.) \n\nThe Dead were a cultural phenomenon, a true inspiration for an anti-authoritarian, alternative lifestyle, and the people at the shows I met were so, so very wonderful. Thank you all for being so good to this young 'un back then.",

      "review_text": "Still holds up after almost 30 years I personally have a hard time listening to any of the SBD's from this Alpine run, as Healy was applying a slow panning stereo chorus to the mix.  (The experiment obviously didn't work because I don't hear any other boards with that effect after.) There's some good AUD's out there that give the feeling of \"being there\". \n\nI did most of this summer tour (some of the fondest memories of my life)! This night, although not perfect, was one where if you were there, you'd never forget it.  Especially the Morning Dew.  It was the Magic of the Grateful Dead at it's best.  I haven't read all of the reviews, but I haven't seen anyone mention that during the Dew, on two separate occasions, a person from the audience walked up on stage toward Garcia.  Nothing threatening, just in awe of Garcia.  The second person came up right after the crescendo of the first solo.  He/she (can't recall the sex after 29 years), walked toward Garcia from Weir's side got within 5 feet of Jerry, backed up as if there was a force field around Garcia, backed up a foot and sat down, cross legged by his speaker cabinet.  Of course Parish was there within seconds, but just politely got the dude/dudette up and gently escorted the mesmerized dead head off the stage. I you listen closely you can hear Jerry chuckle during the first line \"Walk me out in the morning dew...\" after the solo.  Great Memories! Epic Dew. Miss the boys...",

With ya regarding that tour...I went to Alpine and Buckeye -- drove from Tallahassee Florida in a VW bus...long trek...especially at 62 mph...lol...several of my crew went all the way to Maine.  The Dust Bowl shows...and vividly remember the sun coming up cooking me in my tent before 6am -- being so close to Summer Solstice and the latitude of WI..we had like 18 hours of sunlight...dirt blowing around...but such a great time.  Overall the shows were a great time...can't say they were top 10 shows for me -- but a great time nonetheless...!!!",

I never made it to Alpine Valley but have many friends who did and heard their tales.  Yes, as many pointed out below, the vocal effects are odd and take some getting used to, but some real high points in this show.  Love the Pockey Way 2nd set opener - very hot! - and yes the Dew is thunderous!  The stories below of dazed Heads wandering up to Jerry while he plays are priceless - the show truly reaching an emotional climax!  While the Black Bird wasn\u2019t perfect, it was incredibly fresh and alive, and I can only imagine the impact of \u201cyou were only waiting for this moment to be free\u201d had on the Heads as the summer tour lay out before them.  Ah, those were the days when we stopped to decide, where we should go we just ride....",
