Listen, listen, listen to the intense jamming after the chanting. There are so many themes, and styles, located in this 30 or so minute segment that would not reapear for years to come. I've been downloading all of the pre 69 stuff, and there really is nothing comparable to the jamming in this show. I would consider this show to be foundational, in that so many themes years down the road would spring from this single jam. Give me some of that kool-aid, now, and Les Claypool rules the planet in 2004.",

Sandwiched between a LOOONG Lovelight is the first NFA, then a 25-minute long \"Chant\" from the crowd...it's trippy and really weird, and is not really worth repeated listens. The Main Ten and Other One jams are interesting and very well played. \n\nUnfortunately, the SBD quality of this show is very lackluster. It's not as bad as 2/2/69 to be sure, but that hum from the board due to a bad electrical connection during Lovelight and the (first ever) NFA is very annoying. But it's a very interesting show, no doubt about that. Because of this factor, it's worth the download. But get the Lossless version.",

This is what it's all about and personally I can overlook the crap sound for this - When you are listening to the Main Ten close your eyes and suck up the sounds and breath in the Mexican dope and that electric sweat you get when you are dosed, smell the pichouli and clove cigarettes - It's all here. Look up and see the gelatin prints above the stage swirling with different colors. If you listen closely all of this will come to you as it did me on the backs of your eye lids.\n\nMy favorite line of the whole chant is someone saying to another guy 'no bro thats no you thats the drugs'.

A show with a lot of historical interest. It\u2019s like a day off from the usual stuff that band was playing at the time.\n\nThis is the first Not Fade Away, and is the only NFA of 1968. They didn\u2019t play it again until December \u201969.\n\nThe 20-minute Lovelight is looong. There\u2019s a lot of it is vamping, not as much jamming.\n\nThe 20-minute chanting is reminiscent of the acid trips of 1965-66 (some of them are here at Archive.org). It does sound like Grace Slick singing 7 minutes into it. And it sounds like Bill Graham giving orders just before 21 minutes, trying to get the show started again.\n\nThe jam after the Main Ten isn\u2019t exactly solid gold. It has moments of brilliance and other times where it isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nThe Other One jam is the best jamming of the show. Jerry and Phil are dancing around each other for most of it, a real duet, driving and powerful. (The organ is barely audible, unfortunately). This was much longer than the Other Ones they had been playing at the time. (Possibly the first time without Cryptical Envelopment?)\n\nAlso of historical interest is that this is the last Dead show at the Carousel Ballroom before Bill Graham renamed it Fillmore West. All shows at this venue after this are listed as Fillmore West. I wonder if this was some sort of special event to mark the beginning of Bill Graham\u2019s new venture.\n\n(Graham had moved out of the original Fillmore Auditorium on Geary Blvd. at this time. The original Fillmore Auditorium was reopened in the \u201890\u2019s. The Carousel Ballroom/Fillmore West is now a Honda dealership.)",

Between the Grateful Dead sets, Steve Gaskin blew his counch shell and the 3,000-4,000 hippies, most stoned on acid, began chanting 'aum' and 'we are all one'.

      "review_text": "- Wow! Very weird show indeed, but the musical parts are incredible. This is probably a joint Dead/QMS show (aka the Quick and the Dead): both Gary Duncan AND John Cipollina are playing in the post-chant set: Cips is recognizable instantly by his unique trembling right hand vibrato style, and Duncan is also identifiable to Quicksilver fans such as myself. That second bass player is not Jack Casady, and is most likely David Freiburg...whose high tenor voice I'm pretty sure I can hear during the chant. It's interesting to me how comparatively huge and powerful Garcia's rig was at this point: Duncan and Cips had great amps (Cips' was, in particular, a monster of crazy innovative homemade engineering), but when Garcia takes the stage here they are both instantly dominated by the Owsley Stanley-modded Fender Twin Reverb in both volume and tone and the rewound Gibson Les Paul P90s. No band that small has ever sported a guitar-amp combo that powerful and clean with just the right amount of headroom for any guitarist, before or since! And it wouldn't have worked for anybody but Garcia. Getting a thick, smooth scream like that out of a Twin Reverb is basically impossible, generally speaking; you've got to have extremely strong, sensitive fingers and an absolutely insane mad scientist of a modification engineer. Garcia was a very fortunate man for a while.",
