I haven't made it all the way through this show yet, as I just DL'ed it for my morning commute, but my headphones are still in my ears. \n\nThe sound is so rich, warm, deep and nicely balanced, and what a beautiful and soulful performance.  It has that brightness and depth of Europe '72 and those hot healy Matrix boards.\n\nThis is a great moment in the Dead cannon. They weren't quite as brash as '77 but just as technically sophisticated.  They sound downright classy and professional. Song selection is diverse, rockin', sweet, cosmic cowboy and the slightest bit psychedelic. And dare I say it, Donna sounds as good as she ever has.   \n\nI like it when people tell me to listen to a show, so I'll do the same.  Download this show.  I'll refund your bandwidth if you don't like it.",

This has got to be one the best shows during the Keith/Donna period. I was never a big fan of that era, but this has definitely changed my opinion. Quality was incredible too.

      "review_text": "Best source As with most Bertha sources (though you have to look to note this one is).\n\nThe sound on this board is MUCH fuller than any of the others outside the matrix, which may have slightly more Jerry in the mix, but matrix is a little boomy in the mid range for me.  The other boards are focussed in the middle and do not have the expanse that this one does.  God bless you Jay.  Unfortunately, the Nugs source referenced below is no longer there.  I believe that is the one I had on tape as it was up there with some of the best boards I had.  \n\nThe music here is stellar.  I have had all these Bostons for almost 30 years and still come back to them and enjoy.  The wooden sound of '76 is hard to beat.  Unlike any other year.   Just an overall solid show.  Snag and enjoy.",

      "review_text": "One of the most underated songwriters Robert Hunter has to be one of the most underrated songwriters of the 20th century. \nOf course many Dead Heads realize the depth of his lyrics, but...\nWhen I actually look at lyrics to Mission in the Rain, Might as Well or even Standing on the Moon, and so on...I`m just beside myself. That is reason to explore the GD in later years as the songwriting remained at a high level.\nTo categorize the GD as simply a jam band is a description the somehow misses it`s mark.\nAs well, I`ve come to realize Weir and Barlow have had some song writing achievements. I had listened to Mexicali Blues for years thinking it was a standard-it is that well written. Oh and this show... I`m enjoying it. There is non need for me restate what everyone else has already said here.",

      "review_text": "Low jerry just for those that didn't know about the jerry low guitar issue.trading tapes (yes cassettes) back in the day around 1986 there was a couple of tapes circulating of 6/11/76 Boston which was excellent in its own right. and 6/10/76  Boston. in trading,i was always persistent and ended up with many low gen crispy (as we called them) tapes of some great shows.  i had a 'crispy' tape of 6/10/76 but it was so bittersweet because jerrys guitar was only barely audible, like his guitar mic was off or down. that maybe the little bit of him you could hear was just bleeding through the monitors or something. SO that said, ive stumbled upon this gem and eureka jerrys up!  and up he is! this is a very nice sounding matrix recording.there seems to be a painstaking effort to get this soundboard in sync with a very nice audience.  the one thing that i know for sure now is that jerry was actually audible in the house. i always wondered if it was like a bummer show and no one could hear jerry all that night. and it helps me to now appreciate what a great show it is. get this its a must have!
