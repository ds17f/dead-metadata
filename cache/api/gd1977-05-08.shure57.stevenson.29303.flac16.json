This show was acclaimed the greatest Dead show ever, and without a doubt it is.  But then again the entire 1977 show collection is by far the best year they ever had.  I was lucky to get board copies of every show before they were locked out for streaming only.  \n\nA GREAT show from a GREAT year",

This guy was using Shure 57's hahahahha! For those of you who don't know about mics, a Shure 57 microphone is like a broken down 1992 Buick compared to the 2009 Cadillac of the ECM 33P's. The rich bass and instrument separation this guy got is amazing! It almost sounds like a soundboard recording! I wish this AUD was used for the Betty Board splices! I guess any mic would sound good 10ft from the stage. Back in those days, bands actually used their stage amps as a part of their live sound. Nowadays it's surprising to see a half-stack onstage, everybody just uses ear monitors and the big sound system does all the amplification. This guy must have been picking up the amps and monitors onstage. \n\nAs for the music, this is for sure my favorite Dead show of all time. The band was hot, funky, and extra stoned. The Brown Eyed Women is the best there is and the Dancin' is my favorite Garcia solo. Every time I listen to this show it puts me in a good mood! I really enjoy this great quality AUD!",

This writer began going to the shows in '73, also not at all a bad year; my 1st show was with the \"Wall of Sound\" and without Donna, at the Boston Music Hall 11-30-73, released decades later as Dick's Picks Vol.14...\n   But the main reason for posting this review is to comment to reviewer Folkhippy below, who compares the Shure 57 microphone to a beat-up old car. I do not work for Shure, just as an indie musician & recording engineer who uses their mics. Hey Folkhippy, just F.Y.I., many of the world's greatest vocalists & musicians have relied, still do rely, religiously, on the clear, defined tone of Shure 57 mics, for STUDIO RECORDING (and of course for live work)!!! There are engineers who prefer the 57's even to the eternally successful Shure 58's for certain applications. The basic difference between the mics you compare is that the Shures are \"dynamic\" mics, which are generally more rugged and can take higher input gain before distorting, whereas the ECM's etc. are \"condenser\" mics, much more delicate and yes, more defined in the treble end and 'transparent'-sounding... HOWEVER, had our taper at Cornell '77, who was positioned 10 ft. from the stage, used a pair of fine condensers to record the show, it is quite likely that he would have ended up much worse off---the Dead were not known for being a 'quiet' band, and condensers crap out badly at high volumes! (Also,knowing what kind of hijinks went on at Dead shows, a pair of condensers may not even have survived the show intact!) There is a certain warmth, a certain high-midrange accent, that keeps people coming back to those Shure 57's & 58's year after year. Peace & Good Vibes.",

Electric Dead without Phil, for some of us, is pizza with no crust, a glider with no tail, like trying to kiss a thirsty lover in the driest desert wind. Whatever.

I saw them from coast to coast in 1979 and their were too many great shows to recall. It's one big \"purple haze\". My favorite concert (not Dead show) was in 1973 in Watkins Glen.

Scarlet > Fire reaches huge heights but it's the Stephen > NFA > Stephen > Dew that never leaves your soul.

I used to be entranced listening to the Scarlet/Fire jam that lasted about 15-20 min. Now that I've got the whole show here I am even more \"grateful\" for the audio technology of it all...Great show, great show!

      "review_text": "Cornell '77 \u2014 My First Bootleg Experience There's not really anything I can say to add to the significance of the Cornell '77 Bootleg. I can only comment on my personal experience with the tape originally during the Summer of 1984. At this time in the '80s, I was not a Grateful Dead fan at all. I had previously rented and watched the \"Grateful Dead Movie\" and reasonably enjoyed the film. But I was only a 14-year-old kid at the time interested mainly in loud guitar-oriented music such as Jimi Hendrix. Then during the Fall of 1984, a new kid a couple of grades ahead of me whom was originally from New Jersey moved to my small hometown in Georgia. I met him one day at the local mall where he was strutting through the food court donning the brightest and most vivid tie-dyed t-shirt I'd ever seen before. And he was also also wrapped up in a custom-painted denim jacked featuring the '72 Europe Truckin' fool smashing an ice cream cone against his head. I recall many of the rednecks and other small town passersby laughing at my soon-to-be-friend as he happily bounced through the shopping mall. But I was impressed with his freedom and originality. I introduced myself and since I had long hair and liked lots of psychedelic music myself, the new hippie kid in town ended up becoming one of my closest friends. After all, my toes were already deeply placed within the waters of psychedelic music. So opening up to the Grateful Dead as a fan was only a matter of time and introduction to the right collection of songs at the right time. And soon enough, my new friend and I were cruising around in his VW camper van and partying and he put on the Cornell '77 tapes at a loud but clear volume. Eventually my friend and I met up with some other friends in the middle of the country down by a river with a large bonfire as our only light. With Cornell jamming in the background, I was quickly converted to the music of the Grateful Dead. And now three decades later, I still listen to Cornell weekly. There's just something magical about those particular tapes. The sound quality is great. But what's more possibly is the overall energy and performance of the band during those recordings. But for whatever it is worth, the Cornell tapes introduced me to the Grateful Dead and made me an immediate fan. From there I branched outward into all the studio recordings and countless boxes of bootlegs my friend had spent years collecting. Cornell '77 will always be much more than a fantastic bootleg recording to me. It also represents a beautiful period of time in my life and is forever linked to the memories of youth. Anyone who has not listened to the Cornell recordings is seriously missing out on a great picture in time of a wonderful live band which placed a tremendous amount of focus and energy into its live shows making each show a brand new adventure. Cheers!",

I've been on both sides of that same tale -- the guy being introduced to the music (in 1979, when I was 12) and the one doing the introductions (countless times, '79 - present.) Such a rewarding experience to turn someone on to the Dead and watch as they evolve from thinking the Grateful Dead was a heavy metal band (how many times have we all heard that one!?) to riffing off their favorite shows, versions, venues, recordings, etc. Of course it was a whole lot easier to turn folks on to the Dead prior to July '95, for obvious reasons. Nothing like a Grateful Dead concert, after all. But it's a testament to the band and their incredible music and musicianship that to this day there are teenagers and 20-somethings -- many of whom were born well after Jerry died -- getting turned on by and to the music. As for this show, not much I can say that hasn't already been said. The Dew is worth the price of admission all by itself. There are no words. Seriously, I've never found the words to adequately describe this performance -- and I make my living as a writer so that's saying something (hopefully not that I'm a crappy writer.)

Good and clean are reletaive descriptions, however.  Not bad for a 1977 AUD.  Much thanks to the Archive and the contributors!  I have been listening to GD since I saw them live first time in '92, admittedly a very late bloomer..but a very Grateful listener also.  I am old enough that I have good tape-trading memories with friends (as in, before CD's arrived). For those of us who were too young to attend these shows (P.S. I'm now 40 yrs old) recordings like this are the closest thing we'll ever have to a time machine.

There are several shows from each year (up until the Brent years--and even a couple of Brent shows) that have this same magic.  HOT.\n\nSo much has been said about it, I will point out my own personal 20 second highlight:\n\nThe guitar solo in Brown Eyed Women.  Jerry really takes off.  Sublime soloing over the chord changes, switching it up and attacking it from another angle--makes me smile every time I hear it.  No one did it quite like Jerry, and no one ever will\n\nSO-",

With it being Jerry's birthday I of course wanted to reflect on why this man had such a huge impact on people's lives. Basically, I loved to hear Jerry play guitar! His singing & the rest of the Dead playing was definitely a plus. But it was THE WAY Jerry improvised so much and the fact that the Dead in general played the way they played! I remember Jerry comparing it to blue grass, that each instrument played in a separate range and would sort of compliment each other at times & also seem to have conversations with each other at other times. BUT another thing about the Grateful Dead was the traveling. Because of the the Dead I've been to places like Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon & I've also driven from the East all the way to California. Seen & driven thru the Sierra Nevada Mtns & across the Golden Gate Bridge & the Bay Bridge. And MOST OF ALL,  I now live in DC because of a beautiful lady I met while on tour. And if you were creative enough to think ahead you could make enough money in the parking lots to supplement your income. So that doing a whole tour or a certain leg of a tour wouldn't leave you broke and/or you could make more money than what you started with.  But I do reflect on the fact that Jerry had a huge impact on my life. And my life would probably be much different had it NOT been for Jerry Garcia. But he definitely enhanced my life by his love of music & his musicianship!!\n\n   HAPPY 2021 EVERYONE!!! JERRY SOUNDS GREAT no matter what year it is!!! No one could light off the fireworks quite like Jerry did! Through all of these reviews I hear people say oh this is better than that & that is better than this. IDK, some of it I understand BUT after reading 3 or 4 reviews of that nature, it becomes static. Yeah, you know, that irritating noise you once had to hear when trying to dial in a radio station. HOWEVER, I became familiar with the Dead in 1979. DEAD SET on LP was my introduction. I was in the 7th grade and right about the same time my older brother began using LSD. We had both started smoking pot about 4 years prior. So not long after, by the time I hit 8th grade, I was enjoying LSD & becoming curious about other psychedelics & other drugs in general. And curious about all kinds of music as well. Considering our interest in the guitar, we quickly became interested in Hendrix, Zeppelin & Van Halen. And we had both loved going to concerts, so now I find it very disappointing that I didn't see my first DEAD SHOW until 1987 @ the Omni. My brother saw his first show in '85 at the Fox in Atlanta. After we started getting into the seen it wasn't long b4 we had a decent collection of LIVEDEAD tapes. And this particular tape was lovingly known as the CORNELL '77. Unfortunately we didn't have the 1st Set for a long time. We fixed that tape numerous times. And even once took apart a new Maxell XLII & placed the tape into it. That was when we began searching for another copy & found it with the 1st set included.\nHowever, that was back in the 90's & I've lost all my belongings 3 times since then. My brother for some stupid reason tried to get some guy to murder my wife & I.  So, needless to say, I no longer associate with him anymore. My wife & I ended up homeless cuz she was dying of COPD & I couldn't afford rent with trying to care for her 24/7 & pay for her meds too. She finally passed away Christmas Eve of 2015. And so I'm only left with 3 things I love & cherish. 1) the memory of my wife, Marcia \"Kim\" Miller aka \"Roo\" and/or \"Baby Roo\"& when younger aka \"Gypsy Girl\" cuz she was constantly running away from home cuz she was a victim of child abuse. But I've been mostly homeless since her death & only just recently making a serious effort to get my $hit together. \n2) My love of music, Mainly Jerry's music & 3) I have a daughter by the name of Melian Moonstar Miller who was born in '94 & she is the only family I have left on this world & I haven't seen her since she was 9 years old. I love her & miss her & hope to see her again someday. BUT IDK, last week I got hit by a car crossing the road. Broke 3 bones in my leg. I was by myself. When they took me to the hospital, either the ambulances' EMT'S or people at the ER stole all of my belongings, including all my cash, wallet, gift cards, clothes, coat, & backpack. Steal ALL of a homeless man's belongings. But they consider \"me\" to be the lowlife cuz I stand with a sign asking for handouts instead of stealing or robbing from anyone. Somewhere along the line people just stopped caring about other people. Or the larger majority of people at least. I would have to say that 99% of the people pass by me with never a thought about helping. And the one percent that want to help, about half of them can't really afford to help! Actually, after Kim died, I spent 2 years playing guitar for tips. And I actually did really well for those 2 years. Unfortunately it was cut short due to nerve damage.  I injured my funny bone causing nerve damage to my ring finger & pinky & now those 2 fingers can't really do all that much anymore. Uncoordinated & not strong enough to hold strings down so that I can make chords &/or chord changes. BUT...two dreams I had as a teen I at least got to touch for a bit. I dreamed of being a musician  & having a family of my own. I supported myself for 2 years playing guitar & I had a daughter & her mother & I were together 8-9 years. After that I married a wife in 2007. But she miscarried 3x's and then died much, much younger than I figured when we married. But I keep on plucking away. I miss her terribly. \n\nBut anyway, this is a really Great Dead Show! One of the ALL TIME GREATEST DEAD SHOWS EVER. If you want to hear a recording of it that is of a higher quality. Look for it on YouTube. There is a guy called \"Wall of Sound\". He has a posting of this show that is better than the one here. Don't get me wrong, this is very good quality but his is just a tad bit better. \n3/25/23- Well I just listened to this show AGAIN for the idk hundredth time at the very least & its still amazing as ever! \nI was 9 years old when they played this show. Exactly 5 months away from my 10th birthday. One of the points I was trying to make earlier was that I was in the 6th grade when I saw my first concert. It was AC/DC at the Omni in Atlanta. And considering how much I loved music, the guitar, lsd, concerts, I now feel disappointed that I didn't start seeing Grateful Dead concerts about 7 years sooner! Cuz that AC/DC concert was either 1980 or 81, then I didn't see another concert til 8th grade- RUSH- \"Moving Pictures\" tour but \"Exit Stage Left\" had just come out & it was right about this time was the first time I had taken lsd. And in between that show & my first Dead show in '87 I saw numerous other shows. And many, many thanks to the Grateful Dead too, cuz at the time of my first Dead show I was beginning to get into a lot of heavy metal. I never owned an Iron Maiden album but somehow managed to see them play 4 times cuz I had a car & friends that wanted to go. If it weren't for Jerry I might have been a metal head full of anger & hate. Idk if I really could have done that but at least now, I've made a serious effort to purge all of my hatred & anger so none of that kind of thinking is in my brain. And now I make a serious effort to not think that way anymore. Hate, being the opposite of love is very strong & can work inside your mind to make you want to do some very destructive things to people. However, if you can overcome that hatred and instead put love there & instead of thinking destructive you begin to think constructive. You could end up becoming friends with someone that had been a rival. And/or many, many other positive outcomes. This is something that I learned from my wife before she passed away. And it's probably the most precious thing a body can learn or at least in my most honest opinion!!",

How did she know that this magic had to be captured??",
