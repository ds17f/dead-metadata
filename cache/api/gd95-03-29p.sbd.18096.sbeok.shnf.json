[00:37] Jam out of Playin >\n09. [10:31] SOTM\n\n\n**Notes:\n\nThis tape came from a member of the Grateful Dead's crew. This is not from the scanner in the parking lot. It was taped by the crewmember himself. I cannot reveal his name because I don't want to get him in any shit. I am not exactly sure how it was taped inside the venue. He told to me the story verbally about 4 years ago, and I cannot remember exactly what he said. But one thing I remember for sure, it came from him inside, not from the parking lot scanner.\n\nI met this guy when I was taping a GD member's ?post-dead? band in 1998. They happened to be playing at a venue where I know the soundman. I was taping off the board that night. I got into a conversation with one of the band?s crew. (this tape?s source) In talking I found out he was a former crewmember for the GD.\n\nOn this particular night, the GD member?s band did not bring their own DAT deck. So this guy wanted a DAT clone of what I taped. We exchanged info but I did not get around to making his copy for a long while. During that time, he called me a couple of times and told me about this 95 monitor feed tape he had. We agreed and he sent me this tape in exchange for the DAT. He made my copy from his cassette master.\n\nI had the tape in late 1999 and made a copy for my roommate at the time. We?ve since parted ways. Unfortunately, in the 2001 move I lost my copy. I was at my former roommates house the other night and the topic of this tape came up. He dug out his copy.\n\nThe copy of the 95 UBC Philly sound check contained on side B a monitor feed from the Omni in Atlanta from 3/29/95. This is the third live performance of Unbroken Chain. The monitor feed captures the band talking to each other in the ear monitors. They joke around with the names of the songs at the begining - very funny!\n\nSeeded to etree by Marc Pujol\nJune 14, 2003\n\nBig thanks to my friend Austin Mulhern for holding onto the tape which became the source for this transfer.  Hopefully a complete version of this source will surface someday.\n\n\n    length     expanded size   cdr  WAVE  probs   filename\n     1:20.74      14286092     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t01.wav\n     0:36.37       6437468     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t02.wav\n     3:11.70      33857084     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t03.wav\n     7:09.28      75741500     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t04.wav\n     4:00.26      42397196     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t05.wav\n     6:59.40      74005724     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t06.wav\n    15:52.62     168078668     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t07.wav\n     0:37.59       6665612     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t08.wav\n    10:31.53     111433100     ---   --    ---    gd1995-03-29s2p_earmonitor.d1t09.wav\n    50:20.74     532902444 B                      (totals for 9 files)",

Phil seems to have himself turned up pretty loud in the mix with Jerry and the drums right behind. To my untrained ear, Vince and Bobby seem to be almost non existant in the mix. If you like Phil, check this out. He stands out loud and clear.  4 stars for the novelty of it.",

The music is fantastic and every once in a while , its nice to feed the amazement with a fleeting glimpse of their processes. I find that it doesn't detract from the overall magic , as one might supect, and my appreciation grows. Thanks to all involved.",

You have to be pretty damn good to play this way, without listening to the full range of all the musicians playing together (while playing a live venue opposed to studio.)  Who the hell is the idiot above me that simply states two stars?  You obviously did not take time to read the story behind this recording.  Giving a high rating for the absolute novelty of this brilliant upload.  Thank you!!",

Took me a while, but VInce is mixing in bits of the song 'Golden Brown' by the British band The Stranglers through some of it. This was really cool to me as I've loved the song since hearing it in the soundtrack to Snatch in 2000 (the song was originally released in the early eighties). Less cool is it's double-meaning, referring to a girl and heroin.Great song though! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EahJvGKkEe8\n",

In Phil's singing his reach always exceeds his grasp, which is ponderous, as it's always been said he has perfect pitch. In any case this is historical, and lots of people are posting UBC's on Instagram in honor of Phil's Bday. Kudos to the post below which mentions Vince and \"Golden Brown\" -- the Strangler's positively haunting tune about Persian heroin addiction, the very thing that hastened the death of your lead guitarist struggling through this complicated, sad and beautiful poem about life and death.",
