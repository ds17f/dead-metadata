      "review_text": "Deadbase Ranking For Year 1980: No.9 - \"Blasphamy\" Being in Cleveland at the time, but having missed the show, I received a horribly muddy AUD shortly after The Boyz blew threw.  For anything live in those early days, you took what you could get from the friends of your friends - and liked it!  So I appreciatively gave thanks for the addition to my minute collection and jealously guarded my two new Maxell IIs.  In spite of the airy mud and distortion, I listened - spellbound - to the shadow of what I KNEW to be one of the most amazing nights of music The Boyz had ever pulled off.  You could feel and sense the power, and you could hear the crowd goin' absolutely apeshit. \n\nAs the years passed, I refused to give up looking for a better copy (though it seemed to be the rarest of shows to upgrade.) Living in the general area, I couldn't imagine this show being sooo elusive?  Hey, it was only an '80 show.  It wan't like, 1966?  In the late '90s, I began hearing of a better copy floating around but, never hooked up successfully.  So, for twenty-four years, all I could do was wonder how happy I would become when I got an \"A\" FOB of this show, IF it existed.  \n\nWhen the DP extra of the 9.2.80 Iko > Dew SBD came out, I was thrilled.  \"Wow.  I've GOT to get a hold of it immediately.\"  But when I heard it, I swear to god, I thought it was another show.  It was totally sterile and lifeless.  I was absolutely furious for months. What did you guys do with MY show?!?!  But a few years ago, my Druid FOB prayers were answered.  And now everyone can get it!  \n\nSo, gee, one more five star show you say?  Well ladies and gentlemen, I'm hear to tells ya... IT AIN'T JUST ANOTHER FIVE STAR SHOW.  In my entire collection, it's in the top 5...and rising.  The quality of this FOB is not pristine. I agree with The Archive that it's just in front of the board, which gives it a little air.  And with a few bumps and bruises, I'll give it a B++ to A- quality, which isn't too bad for any AUD.  But but but, the energy is waaayyyyyy off the scale! This night is all about - \"the ambience of energy created between the band and the faithful.\"  As horrible as my copy was, this is the show that brought me to believe there wasn't any other way to listen to a Dead show other than an AUD.  Not until Dick's 5.22.77 came around twenty years later, did I soften my opinion on Soundboards.\n\nThe show starts out hard and fast with a blemished Minglewood and just RIPS YOUR GUTS OUT with Sugaree > El Paso.  I'm putting my ass on the line by saying this Sugaree is just behind my favorite 5.22.77. So as not to make this War & Peace, I'll cut to the other highlight...IKO > DEW.  I quote the legendary taper Jeff Silberman in the '75-'85 Compendium: \"One of the greatest Morning Dews of all time.  I am not unmindful that this is a bold statement.  But I stand by it.\"  Deadbase has this DEW listed as 5th best. It is certainly one of THIS reviewer's top favorites, if not THE favorite.  I am also certain that the transition from IKO will become legendary with all Heads, once this audience version becomes widespread. Out of my 300+ concerts, I can count on one hand any other show that equals this night.  I hereby bear witness that the band did not merely make music, they actually performed magic!\" Mr. Silberman is absolutely right. Jeff also adds:  \"Though 9.2.80 is superior to all, it's poor showing for the year is due to the fact that there were very few recordings made; hense it's rarity and obscurity.  Deadbase's yearly ranking of tenth-best (actually 9th) is blasphemy! And I shall not rest until it is accorded its rightful recognition.\" Amen brother.",

Throw in the clouds, cold and rain and it gets down right depressing, but we keep on keeping on. Any way, we arrived early afternoon and went to check out the scene at the War Memorial. Its amazing, that irregardless of the weather, the scene outside a show, is like a biosphere \u00c3\u00c2the world outside going about it\u00c3\u00c2s day,  peeking in on this  alien community that has decided to homestead around a venerable hall, and totally clueless to the joke.\n\nPeter and I need to kill a couple of hours, waiting for Mercurio and Spike the dinosaur to arrive from Long Island. So we head to a local pool hall. Nice enough place that served hot food and booze and shoot a couple of games. All of a sudden Peter is trying, nonchalantly, to get my attention as I chalk my cue\u00c3\u00c2 Low and behold, as Peter is slotting the quarters the coin box opens\u00c3\u00c2Tuesday, Rainy, Rochester, Two boys from the Island and the place is manned by a lonely barkeep\u00c3\u00c2 After 3 games and stuffing as many quarters as we had pockets, we could barely walk out of the place without the floor boards creaking. \n\nBack to the Memorial, $150 heavier...I smell a hotel, that doesn\u00c3\u00c2t mind coin, in our future.\nMercurio shows with Spike, who\u00c3\u00c2s about 2\u00c3\u00c2 high, pink in color, and never misses a show. We all meet up with Mickey the Sorcerer, as did practically everyone. Doors Opens, GA, 7000 Souls .\n\nThe entire show speaks for itself. The venue, the vibe, the song selection and the performance. I listened to the show yesterday, in the car and loud, and that Sugaree is flat out, transporting. The bridge to El Paso is provided by the crowd as Bobby is two lines into the song before we decided to pass Sugaree to the ages. The China/Rider/Lost/Saint/Ease was just a glimpse of what was to come.\n\nAlthea to open the 2nd set, with a C.C., Ship, Estimated, Terrapin, Playing. Are you kidding me? The drummers were practically into the Solo when Garcia sticks it to them for rushing, and Bobby, never one to miss an opportunity to jerk their chain, pulls out the Playing.\n\nFor those who were there, the closing numbers to this show will remain with us through eternity. Maybe our molecular makeup was altered that night. I don\u00c3\u00c2t know. I know that those opening notes to the Dew were the gateway to a place that very few have ventured.\n\nAs we made our way through a side door, a raging River had cut itself into what was once, a Main Street\u00c3\u00c2 Far Out.",

Excellent audience sound quality and multiple highlights here, beginning with a tremendous Sugaree.\n\nCheck out the Estimated for some fantastic Jerry soloing, which slides right into a Terrapin. Jerry's voice is still silky smooth, a pleasure to hear. Phil is also nicely up in the mix here, and the interplay between he and Jerry is wonderful. Interesting jams both into and out of Drumz. Mellow Aiko, but the DEW, well the DEW is just too damn perfect and powerful. Easily one of the best ever. Listen, download, love this one.",

I downloaded it w/out looking at it first, I like to listen without knowing setlists, and upon closing my eyes I was transported from this freezing cold place straight to that warm familiar zone that I miss so. Killer Sugaree and Friend of the Devil, hell even El Paso was right on. Lost Sailor>Saint of Circumstance were both pleasingly ethereal. Althea fell a little flat but probably one of the best Estimated Prophets and Terrapin I've heard from a bootleg , and Iko is always welcome. The  boys are hot on this one with excellent harmonization and superb jams. This makes it to the top 10 in my list for sure Every Head needs this show.",

Have always especially loved the version on Dead Set.  His solo here is quite nice as well.  \n\nAll in all, very solid stuff.  It's a shame that Dead.net couldn't release this show or a couple of shows from fall '80 in place of the May shows released as a Road Trips--those shows are, to me, rougher around the edges.  Presumably this is in the vault, if there are so many versions here.  Oh well, cheers to having lots of live Dead to listen to.",

I might listen to a few songs from an Omni show in '94, then check out a second set from Fall '72. Most of the time, a specific song from a certain era will pop into my head, and I will go search for a version of it. \n\nEvery once in awhile, however, I get pulled into listing to a show from beginning to end; the tightness of the performance ensures that there is no possibility for me to jump to another show before listening to it in full. This Rochester show is one of them. Each song is nearly flawless and a great representation from the year. The Community War Memorial Auditorium is one of those 'classic' Dead venues that attracted a cool scene and fantastic playing from the boys. \n\nThis AUD tape is quite rewarding as well. It is the best source for this date by far, and once your AUD ears get dialed in, you'll find that it sounds quite pleasant. I really have to recommend the second set, but the first one is solid as well. Jerry has Tiger fully dialed in, and Brent's dynoed-Rhodes piano tone is at its best. I love how his keys sound like a vibraphone. Enjoy the ride.",

When the band peaked in the 2nd song of the night with Sugaree, we knew this was going to be a special night, and then when they broke out with China Cat in the MIDDLE of the 1st set, we knew, and what a China Cat it was, and then Jerry steps up and sings Bobby's verse in IKYR.  Amazing.  But how many times have you been at a show when it seems like this will be the ONE but it never materializes? This night, they really delivered.  We just knew they would do something big in the second set, and when Jerry broke into the Dew, we knew it was happening and it was going to be a monster. And it's probably the best one I ever witnessed.  I remember they started on time (!) at 8pm and walked off around 12:30. One of the only shows when it really seemed like they did not want to leave the stage, no short cuts tonight! The Iko People hung out in the back of the arena for what seemed like an hour after the show. When I now reflect on the hundred plus shows I was lucky enough to attend, this one is right at the top.  And as the other posters said, don't waste your time on a soundboard recording of this show, the audience recording captures the moment pretty damn well!",

If this was one of my tour day shows I might give it 100 stars so I give it 99 now.\n Love it when they extend the jams like this one. Also anther time Jerry sings bob's vrs is the Tempe show from June of 1980. \nman they are on this show here. Upstate brought the jam out on the band for sure.

Minglewood was different, FOTD was ripping. The vibe in the Auditorium was juiced. It really was a special night. Maybe you had to be there to appreciate it, but I was there and appreciate it! Iko of course was a surprise, it was pretty rare back then, and it must have been the first time that I didn't think about what was going to be next, and of course a lot of us, including myself got our first Dew, and what a great Dew it was. My roommate, who always complained that they never played it, didn't like it. Some folks are hard to please, but it goes down as one of my favorite Dews that I caught over 18 years. (Check out SPAC 83). \n\nSpeaking about people who complain a lot: You know, back in 1980, we were pretty lucky to be able to get tapes of shows in the first place. Yes, some are hissy, some have dropouts, etc. Don't forget, these were taped by DEADHEADS at a DEAD SHOW! I bet some tapers were tripping, most were at least high. Still had  to sneak your gear in in 1980 too. We all did the best we could and were grateful that these circulated at all!
