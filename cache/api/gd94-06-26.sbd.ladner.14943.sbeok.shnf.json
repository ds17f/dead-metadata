      "review_text": "Definitely NOT the best of 90's, but a good set list! The first thing I'd like to know is why would anyone be stupid enough to copy a digital recording to analog and then back to digital again, unless the one or both of them are totally desperate for a copy and there is absolutely no other way to obtain it? Because that completely makes no sence! Since the so-called analog in not really a true analog; rather a slightly hissy copy with the tiny gaps between the didital samples and then likewise the next is a slightly hissy psuedo-digital! Meaning it likely has new gaps in different places than the original gaps and even if that isn't true, there still is no way it can be considered a genuine digital transfer/copy which if it were as such, it must be an exact duplicate with no loss of qaulity! Futhermore, my last assertion must not be confused with mp3's or 4's or even 1's 0r 2's all of which just like photos of the jpeg variety, are indeed digitally produced, but due to their compression are drastically subject to very significant loss of quality upon each subsequent or should I say successive copy, even worse dare I say, than that of which I trust you are aware of that occurs when a similar series of subsequent copies in succession are made!\n     I was at all of these and yes indeed, \"So Many Roads\" was sweet; along with \"Terrapin\", and the improvisation, (I refuse to call it \"Space\" since their is no air in space, hence no sound, \"The final frontier\" perhaps), amongst others. However, the happy Head that said it was the best of the '90's must not have seen many shows in the '90's. Because for example, \"Eyes of the World\" was one of the boringest I've ever heard! On the other hand, parts were a good set list, like \"Easy Answers\", and some rarities like \"The Shoe Fits\" etc.!\n     Sorry to be so negative, and in fact folks have accused me of being overly critical! Yet I recall, (although it was in the '80's after I'd been accused as such; when I came out of a raging show which shall remain nameless, and saw a person who thought of me this way; I immediately said how much I appreciated the performance)!\n     But unfortunately, since I have far fewer recordings of the shows I saw in the '90's than I do from earlier, even though I can think of ones I was impressed by; it would be unfair to cite a specific date as better, (with the possibly exception of 1994-12-16, entirely with Branford Marsalis, speaking of \"Eyes of the World\"); before having reviewed the recording. So obviously then I could be certain of it's strengths and naturally, some occasional weaknesses, if any! In any case, thanks to this amazing archive that is gradually coming to an end, since it appears to contain virtually all shows from the '90's!\n\n     Augy\n\n     San Diego",

I remember thinking it was amazing when I was there, but really it needed another listen to understand just how good it was.The entire second set is as good as it ever gets.  In the late 90's when they really had it together their energy was very heavy and a little dark, and this show really reflects that, especially the victim and the watchtower, the terrapin jam and the space are very unique, and the morning dew of course.  The dew gets cut at the end, and the US blues encore is missing. If anyone has that encore, please post it!  The show is too good to be incomplete.",

There are great keys here, but not the typical obtrusiveness that I could never quite appreciate from his Vince-ness.\n\nThis show has Jerry on top of his game and at the time I was totally caught up in Jerry's game, so I had to download this show to see if it lived up to the memory.   I had seen the whole run of '94 Sam Boyd and this was the best of the run.\nThis recording sounds better than my memory of the show.  In fact, this recording sounds better than some Dicks Picks I've paid for. \n\nI thought I heard a young man cry about the cut at the end.  It is a total shame that the AM Dew at the end is cut, as it was the best dam Dew I ever heard from the Fat Man in my 50+ shows from '88 to '95.   You get what you pay for I suppose, but I need the miraculous upload of the show ender!\n\nListening to this show, I wonder in as much amazement as I did in the moments 10+ years previous.

A lot of the second sets made up for the short 1st sets, b/c by set two it had usually cooled down to about 90+, whereas first sets were, no BS, about 110-120 in the sun, which is probably a big reason why jerry wanted to bust out a deal and get outta there after the El Paso.

All the yahoo Vegas kids came and went Fri/Sat and Sunday seemed to be just hardcore heads. It felt like a lot less people and their were plenty of tixs for miracle or face. Great groovin' behind the soundboard. First set fun with cowboy vibe, second set naked dancing. Mellow, chill Eyes. Remember a little 'cool' breeze blowing through. Fun Terrapin jam, Jerry just wanted to play this night! Couldn't get him off stage. Great 90's Dew. US Blues as I recall was very flubbed lyrically? Oh well. Don't be discouraged by first 2 nights. Good download. Good post 92' Dead. Last good show I saw. White blotter was nice too!:-)",

Listening to it now confirms it, Jerry was just really feeling it that night and as Joe Blunt says, vince taking the backseat was a blessing.  I think it allows the guys to get back in touch with their true musical selves, Vince just never really did it for me.  The Dew was seriously the best I'd ever seen.  I have seen the entire first set on video, but haven't found the second set...  If the first exists, the second set HAS to be floating around.  They should really release this as a commercial DVD, one of the better of the later years.  So Many Roads really is beautiful as is the Terrapin (listening to it now) - man Jerry was really on that night.  I vote 5 stars for one of the best of the last 3 years.",

I have an Audience of this show and my friend layed it on me as if it were manna from heaven.  I really guess you had to be there.  I was just playing the Audience in the car.  That said the Dew is fine.  The post-Terrapin jam is the best non-Drum aand Space part of the show.\n\nThe first set has it's moments too.\n\nLastly I had to scroll down quite far to learn about the cut Dew.  Bummer!

It starts off with some energy but largely goes downhill.  SO MANY ROADS, which was praised to the heavens by some, is a vocal trainwreck until the ending.  Jerry is also struggling to get his notes out.  RAMBLE ON ROSE was solid, but MUSIC was largely marred by Jer not being able to get anything going on the jams.  The 2nd set, in my opinion, just did not hit the mark.  VICTIM meanders most of the time and Jerry's guitar is largely absent on EYES.  TERRAPIN has moments but not enough to keep it interesting for 23 minutes.  After a weak WHEEL and weaker WATCHTOWER, Jerry definitely comes alive and slams it down on the end of DEW.  Too bad it cuts, but also too little too late to salvage this 3 hour show that largely lacks the spark.",

I think its one of the top five of 1994. \n\nOther than the fall MSG and BG run what sounds better than this from 94'? \n\nOf Course not as quality as fall of 89' or summer of 90', but comparatively to other post 91' Dead this show fares up their with the Cal Expo and Autzen 93' runs as some of the more quality later Dead. \n\nIf people are going to be critical of performance consistency and fluidity there are plenty of other shows to criticize before this one.\n\nHere we have a 3 hour show in 1994 (a generally weak performance year IMHO) with a nasty 23 minute Terrapin, a solid first yet (yeah Jer flubs some lyrics in So Many Roads... so what? Watchtowers a bore, when isn't it?)  Most importantly the band is somewhat focused rather than the \"going thru the motions\" spirit that unfortunately seemed to dominate the later years of the Dead. \n\nOther highlights include an epic Eyes of the World, and a Morning Dew that might surprise you in its climax jam which is super on point. Unfortunately it cuts out about 20 seconds short of the end. We do get the entirety of the Climax jam, but still feel shorted...\n\nAs somebody who would rather listen to early Pre Vince-era stuff this is a show that was actually a pleasure to listen to. \n\nSolid 4 stars for a generally 2 star performance year.",

This was a magical show for me even though I spent Terrapin through the beginning of Dew in the medical tent for heat exhaustion. Some of the reviewers who were there and did not like this show can have their reasons no questions asked because everyone can have a bad day, Ha, Ha...... just kidding........ Who can say what colors a show for a person, for me and others who have reviewed this show who liked it, I hope this review helps. My little back story is....... I spent most of my early 90's in the NH area and saw 9 Boston garden shows ( 6 in 93 and the last 3 of 94 ) plus other east coast shows, but wintered in Tucson for a few years and saw the first and second vegas runs. While back in NH during the summer of 94, I decided to go and visit my brother who just relocated in Boise and also see some shows. I met up with some heads and we went down to these shows. Yes, It was hot...... We camped out by Lake Mead, which for me did not work out. Between the heat and partying after the shows, I was burning the wick at both ends. The first 2 shows were good, but not stellar by any means. We would stay in the parking lot after the shows until 3 am and then head back to Lake Mead after, but then the sun would come up and it would be 95 degrees by 8 am and me with 2 or 3 hours sleep each evening/morning caught up with me......... and by showtime sunday, I was dragging..... I soldiered through for most part of the day and through most of the first set and part of the second set, but by the end of Saint, I started to feel really bad. Had to go to the medical tent until halfway though Dew, chugging Gatorade to fend off the rising Heat exhaustion symptoms but was able to finish off the show. After the show I had to be taken to a hotel room where some friends were staying and was put in a tub of cold water for a while. That helped a little. We then set off back to boise in a old VW bus, but it didn't have air conditioning and 20 miles outside of Vegas, I started to Convulse again and I had them take me back to Vegas where I got a room, cranked the AC and got a flight back to Boise the next day. Still can't handle the heat very well now....... Back to the show...... Even with my problems that night, I was just mesmerized by this show. Sure there were some sore spots..... So many roads, Tom thumbs and Victim is not my fav, but this one had some nice jams. Rest was phenomenal in my eyes. I pondered some of the reviews here and the only thing I can say is for people who were there and it did not do if for them, is that some things just happen to make it not for you. I perceived a charge in the air all night long and maybe you just did not tap into it. That and the playing for this era, lets face it, its not 73/74, was stellar, and they were as tight as I have ever seen, or heard the boys. Would love to have seen some earlier shows, but it didn't happen. Just glad I saw this one. Still my favorite even though i was not at my best for it.",
