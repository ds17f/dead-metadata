IMHO, Sunday's show was perhaps the best show, beginning to end, that they played in the Silver Bowl.  From the \"Help>Slip>Frank\" start to the last strains of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", it was a fun ride.  Throughout the years, one might pick out specific moments in the shows that stand out (i.e.: 91's \"Birdsong\" w/C. Santana, 5/30/92's jam out of \"Terrapin\" w/ Mother Nature's lightshow or that show's \"Spanish Jam\", 93's \"Other One\" {a monster!}, '94's \"Victim>Eyes\", etc), this is the best complete show.  They were as \"on\" as they could be in '92, and several songs were benchmarks.  In particular, the \"So Many Roads\" is tremendous.  True, the solo is not inspiring, but Jerry is absolutely screaming by the end of this song, and the rest of band does its best to keep up.  It has been said before, but you HAVE to hear the \"Attics\" to believe it.  Or, more accurately, not hear it.  I remember the parking lot talk, that they had played it in Shoreline, but you never want to get your hopes up.  You could have heard the proverbial pin drop during this performance - 50K plus just enjoying the beauty of the song.  Get this show for the beauty and the grandeur, and the knowledge that even in the 90's, the boyz were capable of pulling off an entire show that was worth it for all.",

This second set through the encore is literally mind blowing. Welnick did his part on a great encore with the 90s classic continuation of The Whos \"Baba O'Riley\" into The Beatles \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". The only real good thing that came with Welnick joining the band was they added some great Beatles material to their list of covers. This Scarlet Begonias is Mind Blowing, the Fire On The Mountain is Mind blowing, A So Many Roads into Saint Of Circumstance that is not only mind blowing but also unusual even more so with continuing into He's Gone. Great Space and Drums into Attics Of My Life. Then of all things Steve Miller jams from Spoonful till Morning Dew, all amazing 90s versions of these songs. Oh yeah Phil goes crazy on the Other One (take a step back to the 70s with that one). Great Second set show.",

I was supposed to meet a friend who lived in \nVegas to stay at his place, only to find out he moved out of his place the day before. I asked my ride to drop me off on the Strip. Walking down Las Vegas Blvd with my gear, tired, stressed and anxiously wondering what was next. An older Deadhead couple noticed me and the lady asked me what was wrong I explained my predicament and she just smiled and told me all would be well. Not to worry. Moments later some good friends from Denver recognized me while driving on the same part of the Strip at the same time! They stopped and I hooked up with the friend I was supposed to meet originally. All turned out fine! The shows were phenomenal: each one with its own unique quality I remember a horrific dust storm kicked up after the first show. Everybody blinded by dust, getting lost can't find their rides. Mickey sampled the slot machines and kept playing it during space. The incredible lightning & thunder call & response during Drums/Space 2nd show. And the amazing Attics and killer encore of Baba/Tomorrow Never Knows. It was a great 3 day run. And of course a good time was had by all. Thanks for the memories.",

The Dead shows in Vegas always had a lot of heat but this was by far the most energitic.\n\nI had a bonafide  religious experience at this show, and not a pharmcologically acquired one either.  You know when they open with Help on the Way slip into Franklins Tower its going to be a special show.  Nice Bird Song to round out the first set.\n\nSecond set opens with a killer Scarlet Begonia and the music builds like an orgasm and lifts you up through Saint of Circumstance, Attics of my Mind and then completely goes over the top of with Morning Dew.  \n\nYou think, you and the band are spent and you've gone as high as you can, and they come back with an encore of Baba O' and Tomorrow Never Knows.  \n\nUnbelievable, you have been launched completely into the stratosphere. At this point I was able to see from one end of the universe to the other.\n\nLong after the band left the stage, there were people still dancing on the stadium floor and in the hallways.  They were dancing simply to drumming created by banging on tables and other objects capable of producing a rhytmic sound.\n\nIt was a cosmic event, nobody wanted to leave, but the best part is the music still lives!",

      "review_text": "Best Vegas Show This show is a a pretty good show for post-1990 Dead. \nBright sparkly sound, bounce to the playing, hi-tek drums/space, and mostly free of the drug and poor health-induced performance issues that buzzkilled much of this era.\n\nGranted, the band is out of synch in a few conspicuous places - and Jerry does space a few lyrics - and yet I come away from this show thinking that it's still more vibrant, energetic and \"on\" than most of my repretoire of '91-94 shows. (I have no '95s because they're so depressingly lackluster)\n\nKiller setlists too. 2nd set goes on forever. \n\nSteve Miller sits in on the last few songs of the 2nd set, which makes this show unique. You can sense Steve's reluctance to really jump in and make a splash ... perhaps for fear of it coming off like a fart in church.\n\nI think the soundies were having trouble when Jerry switched to higher distortion solo mode, as there are a few times his guitar drops out of the mix when he starts soloing for about a minute until the soundies notice and boost it back up. Don't blame Jerry - he's not nodding at the helm on this one - its the mix.\n\nThe soundies use a trippy flange effect on the vocals at several points in the show. When I first heard this I chuckled to myself at how if I was at this show and trippin, I probably would have just figured it was the drugs, only to have my mind blown a second time when I first heard the playback of the show now, 13+ years later. Kinda like when I heard Rush's \"Roll the Bones\" for the first time while trippin and had to ask my friends \"am I losing my MIND or is a muthafuka RAPPING in that Rush song!?!?\" \n\nYou can still find this show available for DL ... in the strangest of places, if you look for it right.\n\n;-p*",

We stayed at a casino that was at the end of the strip, La Hacienda and not too far from the Silver Bowl. The shows were all early in the afternoon which made it nice to enjoy the night life in Vegas. I remember Blues Traveler was playing at a local club that weekend as well. Vegas shows were particularly good for the boys and the crowd responded well.\n\nThe first set was your typical fare. The Help/Slip/Franklin was a good start with a strong Picasso Moon ender. Nothing especially note worthy.\n\nThe second set kicked off nicely. I remember the audience really shaking during Scarlet. Woman Smarter was nice. With He's Gone into drums/space into Attics, it was a nice transition. The remainder of the set Steve Miller sat in and I could not tell there was an improvement, but in no ways was there any depreciation in the sound. I have to say that Vince's playing was good through out the show and the Baba O'Rily encore was a nice surpise. Tommorow Never Knows was a thrill for me as well.\n\nI saw at least 10 shows during the 1992 run and this one was by far the best.",

Cnick did you even listen to this show besides the one semi-off part during Slipknot where there is obviously a sound problem with Jerry's Guitar but actually by the end of the Slipknot segment it all gets sorted out and the Jam turns into one of the more interesting versions I've heard, not to mention the excellent Franklins that follows. Call me a sucker for the razors edge but check out this Bird Song that comes so close to crashing off the edge but just barely manages to stay on with the deftness of the engineers to create beauty out of certain disaster, and it just gets better from there on in. I'll leave it at that but to not give this show at least 4 stars seems a bit suspect to me and I actually really like the Jerry-Steve Miller playoff at the end of the show so I'm going to bump this up to 5 stars in my book of memories although 4+ is probably more accurate.

This show is riddled consistently with sound issues (new in-ear system etc...) and leads to lots of sedated passages - like sailing on a day with no wind. Garcia's guitar is hardly heard more than half the time. No, he doesn't nod off, but at times just sort of checks out (and many times stops playing altogether as he's talking to the techs into the in-ear system or waiting for the corrections to be made). At others, he's ripping but can't be heard. Certainly this show has great moments, but deserves an honest overall assessment. \n\n(reviewing after watching the Lazy Cow video of this show)",

I had just heard Attics & baba o'riely>TNK a couple days before at shoreline, so not as cool as they could have been. I think Bob and Steve Miller were both doing pete townsend windmill impressions. If memory serves they busted out baba oriely at Cal expo days before. My buddy got a great picture of Phil shushing steve miller so he didn't cut in too loud at the last part of morning dew. One of my better memories of the 25 shows I saw during the 1990's. Blues Traveler was playing in town and I was hoping for a special guest, but to no avail. Did catch New Riders while I was there. Decent show. People seemed to like the opener better. Think the name was Buck Page, old guy from the original Riders of the Purple Sage.",

Heavily blues influenced, \"Spoonful\" into a historic first \"Other One\" into a strong,well sung eleven minute \"Morning Dew\" to close the second set.
