This is really the shit: the perfect example of the Dead's later period style of playing put into perfect effect.  Same x factor, but with an really dense sound.  This music will freak out your house pets.",

I haven't listened to it from here yet, but when I looked at the recent reviews I couldn't beleive my eyes. It is my fave Darkstar, along w/ the 69 stuff,It will bring back many memories, I'm sure. The MIDI was in full effect after verse 1, and Phil was waaaay low in his frequency, mustv'e been 10 Hz, easily. Anyway, thanks Archive for putting these ehows up and giving people like me an opportunity to voice our opinions, it's totally appreciated. I have cancer and music is a source of joy and inspiration, seeing how I can't get out of the house much. You guys are great, keep it up. -eric",

There is a great review of this show in the Compendium, but in sum, although the weirdness starts in set 1 with an evil Victim, when Healy starts shooting Weir's voice through the box during Estimated, it's on.  Brent denies us a truly warped Blow Away rap ala 7/7/89 but the sickness and sonic destruction otherwise known as the last East Coast Dark Star of the 80s takes this show to a whole other place.  The back side of the second set shows a band clearly spent by the activities as they limp through perfunctory versions of Stella and NFA.  The Bid You Goodnight encore is somewhat curious in light of the darkness of the show. \n\nA nice companion piece to the upbeat 10/16 NOD release.  The recording is top notch, the show is just off the chain.\n\nHighly Recommended",

When my buddy & I arrived, they were charging to park in the lot so we pulled the white '71 camaro over to the railroad tracks. Some of the locals were trying to charge 5 bucks to park there but we weren't buying it. For some reason, we thought the rails weren't still used. Feeling crafty for parking for free, we headed for the drum circle under the banion tree. A couple doses later we were jamming away when we hear a really loud train whistle. About 30 seconds goes by & we hear it again but this time the engineer held it for a long time. This time people start cheering & looking towards the train. Then it hit me...THE CAR! I ran so fast & sure enough, the camaro was blocking the tracks & the engineer was going slow enough that he saw it & stopped. When I got there he had a big grin on his face & made some joke about scrap metal...This all happened on the first day. We showed up with no tix but had a little cash for 1 show each. At one point we were hanging around the box office when someone in the crowd mentioned they had a few surprise tix for sale(They were sold out if I remember correctly). We rushed up to the window & scored two tix for the next night...7th row on the floor!!! So the next night comes & I don't know what to expect seeing that I only knew two songs...Truckin & Fire. It was the craziest 3 hours of my life! My head is still whirling around that Dark Star! At one point, Micky & Billy were striking the ground with there sticks & It sounded like stars were exploding! I'm still trying to figure it out! After the show we went back home where I quit my job & have been on the road every since. I LOVE MY CRAZY LIFE!!!

That reviewer had an accurate appraisal. The sound is not as hot on this Second Set. Yet, it is still plenty wonderful enough, or, it is enough of wonderful ~ both sound and performance. An added plus is that there are none of the ticks and drop-outs of the First Set.\n\nThis recording has some inherent distortion which cuts the overall attack of the sound and tends to muffle the vocals. This is very prominently exhibited on Blow Away. You can hear the muffled sound which makes for a certain lack of spectral definition. I say it was inherent because it was a problem that Miller could not correct, or augment, and the signal wasn't bold enough to boost or try to color.\n\nBut hey, it still sounds great and the boys are playing very well. With that combination, how can we lose?\n\nSo, what should we I do? After the jam into Dark, Grab your volume control and turn it up REALLY LOUD, and voila! the distortion will not be so onerous. If you wanted to nitpick you could say that yes, the distortion was still there, but c'est la vie! This is a fabulous recording and a stellar remastering of an outstanding night in the lore of  Grateful Dead concerts.\n\nCan't imagine how anyone could consider this to be a \"dark\" Dark. All Darks are dark. They are also light, and colored, and grey, and black, and everything in between. It's like, with Dark Star there is no wrong note, or wrong sound, or wrong feel, or wrong or dark or clear, or cloudy. With Dark it all just comes and goes as it wishes, without compulsion. I don't know, maybe they had all learned at break that there weren't going to be \"gift bags\" waiting back for them in their 5-star hotel suites.\n\nGeez. Get it, life is dark sometimes.\n\nThe spacey blackness of Dark brings about a vigorous drums and space>Jam>Wheel>Watchtower and thereby preps the listener's ears for the deliciously air blown filagree which is Stella ~ A masterpiece of sculptured pink and hazy cotton candy ~ spun and blown into a thousand aspects! And within each strand the prismatic spectrum; evidence of a sixth-dimensional existence.\n\nNFA and Bid You Goodnight are rather anti-climactic after such a stunningly dazzling performance.\n\nBTW, I have noticed you can't go wrong with a Charlie Miller.\n\nEnjoy. Peace. Out.\n\np.s. I love you, JamminJerome.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBut, I would only kindly suggest that you come down from off of Pluto, Mssr. Jammin.'",

It became a popular tape just for the curiosity. As a result, looks like some now ticklist it as the best Dark Star of the late-Brent era or even of the late 80s & the 90s. Does it compare to 3/29/90, 9/20/90, or 3/30/94?\n\nStarting the First Set, Jer stretches <i>Foolish Heart</i>, trying to whip it into shape, and the band warms, making the final couple minutes decent. They get comfortable with the groove on <i>Little Red Rooster</i> and sit on it for 9 minutes. This is the era where Bobby gave some of it to Brent. <i>Brown Eyed</i> may be 89's best. \n\nAfter that short set, the second set is likewise a bit rough overall. In passing the tapes along, fellow Heads were saying things like \"here's Miami, it's that one that was kinda dark and edgy\". But this isn't the only late Brent-era show where I recall people saying that - even before the sheets came off Dawk Staw. In retrospect the band was shifting around pretty rapidly between spring '89 and summer '90 and mixing it up some. It's not really that dark to listen to at home but people that were there certainly described that way (as well as several other shows that autumn) and had an experience, so it's not just historical revision. <i>Estimated</i> is epic but draggy and sort of spit out. Jer tries to grab it from Bobby and go but it never does gel and, with plenty of minor notes and ominous synth, starts to set a darker tone. That sort of thing was so contagious, with many people sort of wondering, \"what's <i>going on</i>? Or is it just me?\". But of course there's nothing <i>going on</i>. It's just that the same thing that allows sweetness and light accommodates other shades, right? It's a law from the universe. Humans can tap the energy but to the universe we're an unimportant blip, so why deign to claim we're the energy masters? Isn't that just hubris? Perhaps it would not have seemed so dark if it had been played better; i.e. a simpler, unmetaphysical conjecture on this show: you can hear band frustration in places. In <i>Blow Away</i> Brent goes all-in but it still doesn't gel (Blow Aways get much better in Spring '90). Granted the SBD has a poor mix here. Given those set openers, it was a perfect idea for Jer to fling out the four opening notes of <i>Dark Star</i>, the single song for which this show seems to be known (and which would also get better in Spring '90, e.g. 3/29/90; and for one of the best of the four 89s check 12/31/89 or 10/9/89). But it's not that it's the best version, it's the mini-Space jam into <i>Drums</i> that went further out than usual and not the Dark Star per se. You can hear the boys just smirking, going, \"yup, this is where it was going, so let's just strap in\". And where they went we went by default. Faustian sometimes? Perhaps; all part of the bus ride. Parts are pretty good but, at 26 minutes, there are long stretches that are meh. The segue and <i>Drums</i> are hot (how often did you hear Mickey charge the crowd loud enough to be heard on the SBD?). With <i>Space</i> compelling hundreds to leave the venue, what's that tell you? > They failed the test: no <a href=\"http://www.key-z.com/ATdiplomaSM2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">graduation certificate</a>. <i>The Wheel</i> is a long  time coming, for several minutes at the end of Space. In <i>All Along The Watchtower</i> Bobby slurs the verses like he's eating lunch. Jer almost always did justice to it in the late Brent era but it's Bobby that adds the more-than-usual in the last minute with a dueling weave. It's Brent, however, that makes <i>Stella</i> stand.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>:\u00a0  B-\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nLittle Red Rooster\nBrown Eyed Women\nDark Star segue into Drums\n\nSOURCES: The are a million sources for this show, like many from this era; lots of archivist enthusiasm and investment. The best overall 1st Set is miller.20614 but because of dropouts you'll want the cribbs.1829 for Foolish, LLR, & Big River and probably the last two because the segue into Dough Knees is oddly abrupt on the Miller. The cribbs titles don't match the content because Uncle and Big River are one track. For Set 2, the best is the miller18664. The tetzeli34587 is the two Miller sets combined. The millers are a little too sweetened with EQ and could use a noise reduction pass in places but the clarity seems a little better overall.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ntthrockm- Are you that guy that used to bum people out by sanctimoniously telling everybody that they were ruining your scene; east coast shows, ca. late 80s?\neric - Actually, humans can't hear 10hz tones.

      "review_text": "A Show Like No Other. I've been really diving head first into the Grateful Dead lately. This is quite an undertaking; one could argue that each major era of the Dead is practically a different band altogether, in their approach to the music and the jams.\n\nThe Dead are best experienced by their live shows; free from the length and production related limitations of their studio record, the Dead were truly able to explore and expand their sound with their endless yet never tedious jamming, stretching two minute songs into half hour (or longer) brain movies meant to inspire, terrify, delight, and anger. The Dead ran the gamut. \n\nOne of my favorite live periods for the band was 1989. At this point, this particular incarnation of the Dead (the surviving core members plus Brent Mydland, who joined the band as keyboardist in 1979) had been a unit for 10 years, and had grown into an inconceivably tight unit, putting on some of their absolute best shows throughout the year.\n\nThere are a few shows that can contend for best of this year - the two RFK shows as well as all three Alpine Valley shows in July, the legendary two nights at the Hampton Coliseum on October 8th and 9th, and the focal point of this entry, their second show at the Miami Arena.\nWhat start off as merely a typically strong 1989 show suddenly veers into maybe the spookiest hour or so of music the Dead have ever played. The first set starts off rather innocuous, with particularly solid renditions of the opening \"Foolish Heart\" and \"Little Red Rooster combo, as well as a mournful \"Brown Eyed Women\" that gets an extra dose of world-weariness from Jerry's death stained vocals. The first sign that things are going to get interesting come with \"Victim or the Crime,\" a sharp, lurching meditation on the dark side human nature sung by Bob with taut vocals, its edgy lyrics punctuated only by the instrumentations: Brent's piano spikes are something out of a haunted house and Jerry's guitar circles around the music like an angry mob at a witch burning. Heady, heady stuff, dark stuff, but some of the finest music they ever played. The last two minutes of the song is some of the creepiest, nastiest soundscapes the Dead have ever created, relief coming only in the form of a jaunty \"Don't Ease Me In.\"\n\nSet 2 is where things get interesting; while \"Estimated Prophet\" is not necessarily a dark song, its slow, lurching pace and references to death and fire and all that good stuff always gave it a rather ominous aura. It was a song that the band often took it into some crazy, creative areas during the jams, this version certainly no exception. Brent Mydland's angry \"Blow Away\" was always one of his stronger contributions, and this version features some of Jerry's best 'late in the game' wailing on the coda, leading beautifully into...well, let me set this one up first.\nUp until now, there were hints the Dead were going to take the show in a bit of an edgier direction, perhaps because of Halloween approaching and them not having a show on or closer to the the 31st (it was the last show of the Fall tour). \"Victim Or The Crime\" kind of set the wheels in motion, but other than that the Dead kept things on a relatively easy going - if not entirely light hearted - keel. \n\nThen comes \"Dark Star.\"\nIt's often hard for me to write about different versions of \"Dark Star\"; while almost every version of \"Dark Star\" (at least up until 1991 or so) is immense in its own way, it's lumbering lengths and different styles, jams and textures become hard to keep track of, so much that they often blend together in memory (at least for me). Hoo boy, not his one. About two and a half weeks earlier, \"Dark Star\" had been busted out for the first time in five years at the band's second of two nights at the Hampton Coliseum (both shows beautifully captured on the Formerly The Warlocks boxed set), so it was a pretty big deal when this version washed over the crowd. Miami was not only blessed with only the second version of the tour, but arguably the best post-1978 version ever.\nThe song begins normally (or at least as normally as a \"Dark Star\" can be described), with the band riffing on the main theme, and Jerry singing the first few couples of verses (though his previously mentioned ragged vocals make the song creepier than usual). At around 8:29, Brent punches in with piercing chime effects, an ominous preview of what's to come. The true eeriness comes around the 16-minute mark, when the second verse comes into play. After this, \"Dark Star\" truly becomes 'dark.' This is 'River Styx soundtrack' shit right here, not to be handled lightly. It's not a polished version. It isn't as thought out or as tight as 8/27/1972 or 9/21/72 or 10/18/74. It never coalesces into a truly tuneful rendition at any point. And yet, this \"Dark Star\" totally succeeds as a mood piece, conjuring an almost demonic soundscape, with each member playing their part in its construction. If you've ever seen the movie Event Horizon - about a rip into the space continuum that allows for a rescue ship to be possessed by a demonic force, killing its crew - this version could easily be its soundtrack. (To make matters all the more creepy, that movie has a character named Weir for its leader, a position Bob had acclimated to once Jerry's health really plateaued.)\nI have to admit, I would've loved if somehow, by some odd turn of events, this \"Dark Star\" segued into something \"Sugar Magnolia\" or (as on Sunshine Daydream), \"El Paso,\" just for the sheer mindfuckery of it all in terms of mood and atmosphere. That said, the band was probably just as overwhelmed as the audience was, leading Bill and Mickey to hold down the fort with the usual \"Drums\" piece. Things aren't getting done getting really, really fucking weird, though, with \"Space\" retaining the most frightening elements of \"Dark Star.\" The reviews on the Internet Archive (a.k.a. The Mecca for Dead Collectors) mention how large swaths of the audience - no doubt on some form of a hallucinogen or another) - departed the arena, looks of sheer terror plastered on their faces. It was a dark ride, and some Deadheads just wanted off. The tempo, if not the mood, brightens significantly as \"Space\" fades into \"The Wheel,\" which is a solid if not top shelf rendition, before leading into one more glimpse of the apocalypse with \"All Along the Watchtower.\" The typically gorgeous \"Stella Blue\" follows, Jerry singing and playing with all the sensitivity in the world, leading into a raucous \"Not Fade Away\" that finally gives the crowd much needed relief from the 'arsenic and hellfire' trip they've been on.(edited)\nThe show ends with a touching \"We Bid You Goodnight,\" a song that serves masters: on the one hand, it's a celebratory farewell as a brother bids his kin a safe journey into the arms of the Lord, complete with close harmonies and handclaps. However, with all the ensuing chaos established by the second half of the show, I often envision \"We Bid You Goodnight\" sung by those unaware of what had occurred previously, with the rest of the show being some freakish deathbed fever dream by the departing brother.\nIt is not every day I am this bowled over by the atmosphere of a live concert. With live recordings, I close my eyes and imagine myself in the communal glow of the crowd, which adds warmth, comfort and excitement no matter what I'm listening to. Not this show, by any means. I listen to this show and see myself running for the exits. I've not even been high listening to this show, nor did I need to be: it's a trip without actually having to take one.",

In the liner notes to the concert's CDs, David Lemieux raves: \u201cIt starts out with a nice, deliberate rhythm, but it turns into one of the biggest collapses the Grateful Dead have ever done. It's extremely profound.\u201d Collapse, that's the word. It's as if we're witnessing the fantastic formation of a black hole, swallowing everything within its reach - enormous - as it grows. It's a collapse, an absolute anti-music, which seems to have frightened off some spectators who weren't real deadheads. And it goes on for half an hour, followed by ten minutes of percussion and then six minutes of interstellar musings, before returning without any transition to the form of a normal song. I just love it. Not only do you have to be excellent musicians to play like this, but above all they have to be extremely synchronized and give themselves absolute freedom, unafraid to explore and stray, outside the norm. Who else but the Dead could play like this?",
