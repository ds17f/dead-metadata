This beautiful, clean, and solid SBD brings it all back - from the lunacy of the Frozen Logger that showed the band to be having as much fun as those of us between the Rocks, to the bouncy-steppin' Shakedown St, followed by a sparkling Crazy Fingers that sounds for a few golden moments like the Dead of the early '70s.  The whole 2nd set really flows with pure Dead goodness.  One of the great latter-day Grateful Dead concerts in a world-class setting, in a crispy SBD format.  YUMMY!\n\nLpenoza",

I woke up that morning, ate breakfast at some greasy spoon, and I was simply in a foul mood.  It was the third of three shows and I decided to blow the the last day off. I was driving up I-70, on my way back to the mountians where I lived at the time when I changed my mind, turned around and headed for Red Rocks.  I showed up just as the show started and I remember hearing the first couple of songs on the hike up the hill.  I was still kind of grouchy at the break, but I ran into some friends who invited me to join them.. and they had pretty good seats...just above the sound board and off to the side a bit.  The second set started and it felt like a 10 ton weight was lifted from my shoulders.  Not only was the music fantastic, but the feeling it gave me that day is undescribable.  For years after I had an audience recorded cassette of the show that I would listen to when I was feeling down and it always perked me up.  That beloved cassette \"sprouted legs\" at a party in about '94 and all I had left was the memories of that day and how that music affected me in such a profound way.\n\nTimes have changed and I have moved from the mountians to the sea.  I live on a sailboat, currently in the Sea of Cortez.  I found this website, and this show, and I was actually nervous about hearing it again.  After hearing this story, my present girlfriend downloaded the show to her computer, burned a cd, and pulled it out of her bag and stuck it into the boat cd player (without saying anything first) one afternoon on a sail from San Evaristo to Bahia Aqua Verde. The music was even better than I had remembered, and it still gives me that special feeling!!  What a treat, what a show, what a great band, and what a great website this is...Thanks",

I wasn't in a fight but my relationship with my companion amongst other things were on a definite slide, yet I didn't miss any of the shows. Since these have been thoroughly reviewed I'd say this one was the overall best and certainly lived up to the level of the other two years I saw them here, '79 & '82. I may elaborate further, later but, some of you may be sick of my numerous reviews. I got to go eat lunch now.\n     If you haven't heard this one, well like I said elsewhere, it has stiff competition during this year, but most assuredly it holds it's own charm. Well enough for her and I and I can't imagine anyone there who didn't enjoy the experience, regardless of one's personel ups or downs !",

I find the rating system for this era to be out of whack, I hove found very few 5 star shows after 1985.The last 10 years, for me were dissapointing, and it was obvious that Jerry was declining and it was hard and sad to watch him deteriorate before our eyes. It does seem that most of the folks here are younger heads who love late Dead and appreciate the classics as well. While I certainly understand the propensity to prefer the shows you were at, I think there is far too much love for later shows here, compared to what IMHO is one of the best periods, Fall 1979-Fall 1982. .",

The frozen logger sent me up into the rocks way up behind the audience where i spent most of the show dancing with a few other wide eyed freaks as the music came surging up the ravine.\nIt is hard to describe what it was like hearing Brown Eyed and many of my absolutely favorite\nsongs as I was gazing out over just about the entire Nation.\nI will also say that they put my favorite Album BLIND FAITH on the PA at REDROCKS that weekend.\nI will give you my reasons for giving this a five\n1)The band is loose as hell, lots of laughing, talking, banter, the whole logger thing is like a flashback to the acid tests.Yet by the time they get into the show you can hear a pindrop as the music plays the band.\n2)The playing is tight, the reason 1985 was a good \nyear was because the dead really tore into the tunes,they took care of business.You can hear on this soundboard that everyone is in the mix!\n3)tune selection-set 1 >All the jerry tunes are classics. ESSAU>Almost extinct.Saturday Night>Closing first set usually a good omen\n\"Ron, it is SATURDAY NIGHT\"\nSet two-What more could you want in a second set? Shakedown>Fingers>Samson, (I was dancin so hard during Samson i almost fell off the ridgeline) Uncle Johns>Playing (I thought about what the future would hold that day, the Cold War was still \ngoing on, lots of hate & turmoil, people choosing materialism over peace and love, yet I felt good here was this band that put me in touch with feelings and emotions that transcended the petty rat race, The Playing is moving real fast, nice jam into drums and it was at this show that I began to get into Brent- Fantasy>Hey Jude>Fantasy and then how about Truckin>Comes A Time>LOVELIGHT! add a two song encore JohnnyB>Baby BLUE\nYou know in real estate how they say location! location! location! well that does not always work\nfor the DEAD but if you go sit on a mountaintop and listen to this show YOU WILL GET IT!(Do it with headphones so you don't mess with Mother Nature.)",

The Crazy Fingers is nice, but the Frozen Logger will probably make your ears shed tears.\n\nPretty unremarkable show, but it could be a whole lot worse.",

Incredible time and place. \nI thought the whole Logger thing with Jerry breaking a string was possibly staged. I could be wrong and I guess it doesn't really matter.\nIt was cool to see them all laughing and having fun. This whole scene just added more fuel to the fire for me moving to Colorado a year later. This pesronally was the most fun Red Rocks run!",

      "review_text": "Goonies. Onstage and off <br />The final day of a three-show run. Known for the goof-off opening, a good Shakedown and Brent's spontaneous Hey Jude, which became a thang. People must be curious - there are fifteen sources on the archive, yet for the better show the day before there's no SBD or matrix. Some shows I can remember. We had scored four tix for the previous shows but twelve for this one, even though Saturday was harder to get. So we invited half newbies and I got to miracle the cat that put me on the bus many years before. Plus our section accumulated some tour friends. I'd gone solo and with a few people, usually seeing a few acquaintances. But I'd never had this much of a row. At the time I thought it was the lesser-most show I had seen (though balls-to-the-wall fun), but I knew someone that thought it was their best! Goony Bird had gotten into our group and it was frowny shite for a couple hours, challenging those that were going uphill, arms crossed or pawing, struggling for the meadow at the end of the tunnel a couple hours down the road. With heads full of iffy Goony, at their first show, the opening gambit blew minds in the not-typical way and they naturally turned to me for steering (Is this the concert? This is what everybody talks about?). But all I could do was grin. You just go with it. You pass the test. You turn pro. One old hippie friend was highly entertained with teasing my newbie wife with a bunch of imaginary rules of the scene, until she got wise to him. I wasn't perplexed by Bobby's song nearly as much as Mickey's kazoo playing. People were losing it. I  zoned safely. When the \"real\" show started it was like a storm lifted. Everything has normalized...uh, you know, more or less. Then a real storm came! Between sets they had to put a tarp over the soundboard (right behind us) and as the wind blew and temps dropped about 20 degrees (normal at 6400') non-combatants, mutants and friendlies were walking around going \"they're not coming back!\" \"Yes they are\"). By night's end some of the cats we brought stepped right on the bus, found a seat and enjoyed the scenery. Others \"made their decision to follow routines\" as Garcia once put it. \n\nSupposedly Owsley was the dude helping Healy but I didn't know what he looked like and it may have been a rumor. My friend and I had run into Walton a few days earlier and more than a hundred miles away. It didn't occur to me where he was going so we did NOT talk about the Dead. He was on crutches. When he suddenly appeared in our row I couldn't figure out if he recognized us but at that point it was full-on Deadersize anyway. The scene/vibe changed noticeably for  Saturday - a different ratio of onlookers-to-tourers, with a higher percentage of weekenders, locals, yuppies* (well, good for them), and regional campus types, and with hundreds more diehard shutouts seeking miracles and later dancing in the lots to piped Jerrr-reeee. The crowd was restless by 3pm. Saturday was a zoo. Tired of it annually, the Morrison locals had petitioned to stop the shows. The compromise was to change to a 2pm showtime, which was why the tix were stamped. This night, the band pushed back, starting late, goofing off for 10 minutes (the contract and its agreements do not start until all bandmembers are onstage), and taking a long set break, ultimately using the lights on this night after sunset. It may have been the crew's decision or may have involved equipment, but the \"Jerry's dealer made him late\" comments are sophomoric. For rainout back-up, the org had people at CU Events Center. June/July are the trickier months at the acoustically-poor Red Rocks, and the late-summer blackness that blew through was swept away with Jerry's broom.\n\n\nFirst Set. After a late start, Bobby comes out. Nobody knows what's going on and Healy fucks with his voice. There are perhaps a few people that knew <i>The Frozen Logger</i>, but mainly nobody knew WTF was going on or what he was singing - or why. Especially with sound effects from the board. He had played it a handful of times in '70/71. After a few minuted it's ditched. A while later (most sources trim this gap), Mickey and some tricksters (crew, friends, it's fuzzy) came out with kazoos and slidewhistles and performed (sorta) the Star Spangled Banner with Healy adding birds. After several minutes of this the boys took their places and started <i>Half-step</i>, ending what was a mixture of laughter, confusion and horror. Peace was upon the land. It's uptempo - and will be, the whole show. <i>Minglewood</i> is hot - one of the best I saw (Denver fillies/T right here in Denver). It's careening, and when it sounds like it's going to be slide practice, it turns nifty. <i>Brown Eyed</i> is fine (weirdly, after this I had a ten yr gap between BEWs, often missing by one night). <i>Loser</i> is fantastic - it's Bobby that's having the great night. It sounds like he teases Stranger but instead it's relative rarity <i>Dupree's. One More Saturday</i> is strong and sends 'em to break happy. Jer wasn't as good this night but the weirdness and tempo made a lot of heads happy.\n\nSecond Set. Some have cited this <i>Shakedown Street</i> as a standout. It does have some really nice parts. But it's not, say, 6/30. <i>Crazy Fingers</i> is a bit of a struggle. The end jam for <i>Samson & Delilah</i> brings things back, with Jer fireworks over Bobby slide. With the next Jerry song, it's back to rough - Bobby audibly cues him for <i>UJB</i> lyrics. The day before, Jer had chided Bobby for starting off too fast and now he's getting revenge, starting the <i>Playing</i> way uptempo; and the drummers acquiesce. It gets real spacey - kind of a free-for-all, but it works, in a taste-of-'72. <i>Drums</i> is great, with Mickey on his beam and all the toys that he brought to Red Rocks in the '80s. <i>Space</i> is great, too - don't skip these. Coming out of <i>Dear Mr. Fantasy</i> is the \"first\" <i>Hey Jude</i>. Technically Brent's first; they had actually played it twice in '69. But only trainspotters toting their Compendiums knew this back then. People went nuts and we just thought it was cool to witness a brief moment of Dead history. I saw other first-time-playeds that got little response. I guess it's because everybody knows Hey Jude; but you wouldn't drive hundred of miles and stand in line for hours twice, for a snippet of a cover of a Beatles song. Next comes a Bobby word-fest, so what does Jer do? He challenges Bobby's mouthfuls by taking off at a pace that prevents even his own usual fills. But Bobby does well and the drummers have tightened up. <i>Comes a Time</i> is above average; the rest isn't (though Jer has one of his best turns of the run during <i>Lovelight</i>). Another uptempo set for a speedy show.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0B\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 3\u00bd stars\n\nHighlights:\nNew Minglewood Blues - careening then clicks into place\nLoser - Bobby is glue\nShakedown Street - some excellent parts\nDrums>Space - one of the skullcappers; the foothills melted\n\nSOURCES: The updated, patched SBD is the sbd-pcm_miller_33954. However it is pitched slightly fast and <u>needs -1%</u>. It's also missing part of the opening. The seamons_fix_92521 is a remastered matrix with a rich image and the complete opening. All sources seem to run fast, with some AUDs running @ +2%. If ever there was a tape I looked forward to getting it was this one. I wanted to relive it to see what happened and recompile. I had the Morris AUD, but sorta low gen. It's here in all its glory (pitched too fast and with part of the opening cut). The best AUD is the sacks_29305 of the Oade source. The complete first set is:\nThe Frozen Logger  \nStar Spangled Birds\nMississippi Half-Step  \nNew Minglewood Blues  \nBrown Eyed Women \nMy Brother Esau \nLoser\nDupree's Diamond Blues  \nOne More Saturday Night\n\n*Look it up, kids",
