So many roads from philly led to UCLA when the Winterland show was decided to be out of reach. About 8 of us ariving one at a time in LA. We all decided to lay back and just chill until about halfway through Jack Straw. Nice try. \n\nLow stage, the band had no feet. They played like it was the night with no pressure. New years eve the next night HAD to be legendary, they were closing winterland! This night was just for fun. Lots of BIG smiles on Jerry. \n\nThe whole group of Egyptian hand clappers on stage was different. They were all dressed in blue robes. Clear as day in a foggy mind I remember Jerry laughing as he played some behind them going into the space.

      "review_text": "\"Who's \"Clive\" & where's my stolen virtual entirety master recording? Firstly, who is \"Clive\" that Weir substitutes for \"life\" Jack Straw? Bob Weir is referring to Clive Davis the head of Arista Records with whom they had recently signed a contract with for the \"Terrapin Station\" & \"Shakedown Street\" albums. He was apparently in attendance here, but supposedly complained that they didn't play \"any new\" or was it \"many\" tunes! Oh, contraire, indeed they played five tunes from the \"Shakedown Street\" album alone and one from the Terrapin Station album!\n     It certainly isn't the only time I've heard Weir say the following in \"Mexicali Blues\" but not often \"Everybody Polka\" since the rhythm of that song is in a polka style. Check out the way Jerry really powerfully instrumental especially the final C chord of (as I am at this moment feeling the chills all over not just in my spine as I listen again now) definitely the greatest version I ever heard \"Tennessee Jed\". Absolutely unique, I never elsewhere quite heard him grab that chord like he does here! \n     This is the only time I ever saw \"St. Stephen\"! Despite my apparent bias this one is relatively if not absolutely unique if for no other reason than the fact that Garcia uses the envelope filter (save perhaps the next day at Winterland; although I watched that one too live I have to re-listen) in part of the instrumental progression in the fact that Garcia plays in the opposite direction in terms of ascending verses descending, unlike every other I can recall! Why and how do I know? (see below). This was the the very best ever performance of \"Olin Arrageed\" with Hamza El-Din. Superior even than any of the ones at Winterland, and even more so than the rather future dull performances! This monumental performance is not only well over 3 hours in with this 12 song 1st set (one of the three longest I ever saw) was tough to record without any cuts!. Mine was not perfect, although I got all the way through to the end, with Mathew Kelly on Harmonica etc., unlike even this here soundboard (not counting its patches) which ends all together going to another audience recording somewhere in \"St. Stephen\". For the encore, since the show was so long, I was forced to use a lesser quality grade of tape (see below), rather than all before on Maxell XLSII. And the encore \"One More Saturday Night\" isn't the best I've ever heard but it still it cooked!\n      I was recording from well in front of the board; I do recall I was ~10-20 feet in front of that a guy with the Nagra! I still remember it in color from having been looking at them through my binoculars, with my elbows each steadily planted on either side of my recorder strapped around my neck, with my microphones strapped one to each side of binoculars. (My J.V.C. KD2 (which I bought in the middle of the Winterland shows in October), with super ANRS noise reduction which alone is far better than Dolby B and at least comparable with but not compatible with Dolby C) I vigorously contend is better than the important to note still not yet been released for another =/< 4 months well known future as a common standard machine, namely the Sony D5 and later still, D5M. This is despite in being somewhat bigger in size giving it besides the results themselves which obviously are most important, in its use better metering in terms both of sight and control as an analogy but not exactly the same relational difference for example, the differences in readout/control (smooth or the lack there of) between the D6 vs. the D5 metering. Which turned out great!\n     Oh well, I hope who took my recording away from me several years later eventually came to appreciate what he had obtained, but I have strong doubts of that and suspect it may have been erased or trashed, boo-hoo! Regardless, of what was my great fortune for a while that turned rotten, I can assure you that this is highly recommended!\n\nAugy\nSan Diego",

To be on stage such as they were with absolutely no pressure -- that's when the GD were at their best. And Pauley Pavilion was one of the band's friendly confines.\n\nThe AUD of this show on the archives is also very good. This version, however, has more bass presence. My only criticism with the SBD is that it leaves out Bobby's guitar. The AUD accentuates Bobby's guitar and it's the definition of definition. Nonetheless, in the next set Bobby is omnipresent and it evens things out.\n\nEvery first set song is a chart topper, enthusiastically played. Great versions of Jack, TLEO, Loser, Stagger Lee, Passenger (except for the one clam they always leave for this song!), Tennessee (Jerry bends and bleeds that Wolf into man's best friend), Sugaree and Promised. At 3:46 into Promised, Jerry goes crazy. Near the end of his freak out he whacks it and the band whacks back and he's so surprised that he tries to cover and flops and then recapitulates. Oh, heavenly recovery!\n\nSimilarly, the second set is in and out perfection bumping and slamming us up against the walls.\n\nShakedown comes into it's own as if it were written for Westwood. The penultimate expression of this time and place captured in one great gasp.\n\nThe remaining is anticlimactic -- a repeating into eternity of a sound so spun that one can clearly understand why the band laid themselves out supine and were summarily \"tired\" the next night.\n\nTruly they spent themselves divine on the night before the big Closing of Winterland blowout.\n\nIt is truly amazing that they were able to summons so much stamina, held in reserve, for the NYE celebration.\n\nSecond wind.",

      "review_text": "Walk on the Wild Side This version of Sugaree caught my ear the first time I heard it because it was just after I'd read that Garcia wrote \"Franklin's Tower\" around the \"doo-da-doo-da-doo\" part of Lou Reed's \"Walk On the Wild Side. (In one of the Garcia bios)\nAnd if you notice after the final solo in Sugaree, Jerry (I believe) plays the bass riff of \"Wild Side\" for a few measures. There are a few other versions that hint at it, but this is the most blatant that I've heard. \nThe same year as \"Franklin's Tower\", Lou put out an album called Sally Can't Dance that has a tune called \"Charley's Girl\" which rips off the same part of \"Wild Side\", but with very Lou-ish lyrics--a drag queen getting beat up or something. \nI'm sure Lou was just tickled (not) to find out that the Dead had a song inspired by him. \nAnd yet (here goes my spiel), the last Velvet Underground album (Loaded) and the first Lou Reed solo album (just called Lou Reed, and maybe out of print) both have moments that are very in step with what the Dead were doing at that time (1970-71). And, the Velvets, circa 69-70 were just as likely to do a 15-20 minute workout of a song, albeit with a stricter rhythm section and a lead guitarist with a slightly more limited vocabulary (in Dead terms, imagine if Weir had to solo for 12 minutes...)",

Great jams and inventive playing from Jerry on Jack Straw, Passenger, Tennessee Jed.   even promised land, which can be forumlaic has some twist to the typical jerry \"scrub\" crescendo",

I've had a copy of this show since 1982,and every now and then I listen to it hoping to get what others get,but to no avail.The recording quality is fine (a few cuts/drop outs/patches) but the playing leaves me cold.Far too many mis-cues,the band never seem in sync,and nothing holds my attention.I'm glad that other people love this,but it's not for me.",

I love the way they start Scarlet Begonias, all taking turns and finishing each others sentences before heading full on into the song. That \"game\" as I call it really starts at the end of Good Lovin' so start it near the end of Good Lovin\" to get the full effect. Had this on cassette back in the 80s. Glad to have a digital copy again.",

      "review_text": "Eleanor Rigby This is a pretty good, solid show considering a) it's '78 and b) it's the night before a marathon.  They played surprisingly long and well for knowing they had an all-nighter ahead of them the next night.  It's All Over Now in particular shows the good and the bad of '78 -- the bad being Keith's boring, predictable, percussive chording with his tired, old, monochromatic Yamaha electric piano, and the good being Jerry's solo that follows.  Jerry wailed all over '78 because he had to -- Keith wasn't bringing it and Bob's attempts were amateurish.  \n\nThe jamming meat of this show is Scarlet>Fire for sure.  Again, Keith's contributions are limited, but Jerry is filling the air with rapid arpeggios and cadenzas during the Scarlet jam, then turning it up for Fire.  It's a pretty standard rendition, meaning great.  Playin > Shakedown is too short, though -- they could have skipped the \"rockin'\" opening of Miracle>Bertha>Good Lovin and spent more time on the jam material.  Ollin Arageed is always nice.  St. Stephen is fun, but they maxed out on that song on 1/22/78.  \n\nBy the way, Keith lays down an Eleanor Rigby tease starting about 8:03 in Shakedown.\n  ",
