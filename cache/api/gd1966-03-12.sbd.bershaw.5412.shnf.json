It appears that David Lemieux, keeper of the vault, and the chronological compilation of the Acid Test recordings listed in The Grateful Dead Tapers Compendium Volume One don;t agree on what day this is. Considering the circumstances, it shouldn't surprise a soul...\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: this show segment RAWKS! We have a 14+ min Viola Lee Blues for the ages: loud, raucous and not unlike a jet taking off in your ears. You See A Broken Heart was new to me, and it's a great little bit of Pigpen Pop with Pig and Garcia doing a call and response vocal...even a harmony between the two at the end! Sweeet...and it all rounds out with a Midnight Hour featuring great Pig vocals, fun Garcia solos to put a smile on your face (including his first solo where he imitates the original Martha & the Vandellas horn solo: awesome!), and almost inaudible drums (sadly). \n\nMidnight Hour also cuts off abruptly before the end, but it's pretty long as it is...who knows how long it REALLY went on for? ;-)",

It is obviously not the same as the other Viola Lee on the more complete 3/12/66 post (which also may be incorrectly labeled from 3/19/66)This is a faster, longer version(and harder)that was probably played later that year after they had some time to refine the song(like 12/1/66 as Light_into_ashes pointed out). All good listening tho. \n         Thanks again to the people who have posted these wonderful shows. Its only 3 songs but I can't see not giving this 5 stars if not for the pure historical aspect.
