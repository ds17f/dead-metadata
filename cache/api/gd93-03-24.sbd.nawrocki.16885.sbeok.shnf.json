The entire 2nd half of the 2nd set is amazing.  Spanish Jam > GDTRFB > Throwin' > NFA is amazing.  I personally think this is the best Throwin' I've heard.  Unfortunately, there aren't many good audience recordings of this show (hint, hint) because the boards do not have enough Phil in the mix.  It was nuts during the jam in NFA where Phil does some noodling and then just shakes the entire Dean Dome with an ultra low bass note.\n\nGet this, and hopeufully a full sounding aud recording will surface.",

      "review_text": "Digital Annoyance I remember listening to this show  just a few hours after it ended. My friends and I left this house we were staying at that was full of grouchy girls who actually went to Chapel Hill U and several of them all lived in a house together...we made the \"stay\" connection while in Atlanta.  This really hip guy whom we barely knew told us he knew some ladies that we could probably stay with while there since we had tix but didn't have a place to stay.  He made the call and it was on.  They lived like 1 block off the little main street that ran next to the Smith Center.  Ben and Jerry's and a bunch of cool little shops, etc.  We got the hook up.  But like I said, they were not a cheerful bunch because they were still attending classes at the time and like 1 or 2 of these girls had tickets and I think only one had ever even seen the boys before so she knew what was up.  The other ones(no pun intended) couldn't seem to deal with all these thousands of extra folks that were lierally filling this beautiful little town up.  I think we got on their nerves.  They were just jealous they didn't have tickets.  They all ended up scoring tix by the 2nd night so that part worked out.  What happened was one of these girls knew some local Head in town who was taping the first night.  We were on the floor right in front of Healy and I remember this major commotion going on back in the taper section, but we had no clue, nor did we care cause we were so close cause the floor was tiny and we could see the guys very well.  I remember getting pissed at these clowns behind us who wouldn't shut their mouths during drums and especially space.  They were talkin' some really petty homelife crap and when I heard Jerry playing that trumpet sound and Bobby started strumming the notes to Spanish Jam, I really started to lose my mind.  These goofs behind us were pissing eveybody off.  They drove all the way from like Oregon or something to discuss remodeling their kitchen during music that HOT???  Well I turned around and more or less put an end to that.  Everyone around us was glad.  I wasn't mean.  I just told 'em to save it for the ride home cause evidently they just DID NOT realize what was coming out of the speakers.  Now they did.  GDTRFB had smiles on everybody's dirty 'ol mug.  Anyway, several hours after the show we wound up at this guy's house.  We didn't know anybody.  He puts on the tape to the show from that night.  I had never heard a tape that clear and crisp up till that point.  Especially mere hours after it happened.  I do remember him saying that when Healy threw out the patch that there were just so many folks trying to get on, that that is how the static came to be and that it was part of life.  Wasn't a big deal to me.  I do remember Phil being especially aggravated at something out around Healy that night.  You could just tell something wasn't right.  Several months later Healy was history.  I heard he took some cash for that digital patch that night.  That also may be just hearsay and a large rumor, but it sure seemed to fit the situation.  This was one of the three best I ever saw out of the few I attended.  Deer Creek 6-28-92 was one of the others...\n\nOne of my buddies ended up scoring with one of the girls that we stayed with.\n\nImagine having to go to class and having a swarm of Deadheads rollin' in all day and night till you couldn't tell the students from the Heads...My memory is still a touch vague, but that's what went down to the best of my recollection.  There were not any nugs or Blotz to be had either.  The SoberMan's Dead.  I remember a lot of folks getting really drunk...Hot Shows...Beautiful Campus.  Wonderful times...I sure as hell miss 'em...",

I was right about the first part and not far off with the second.   I have never seen a happier crowd than at this show and Jerry was grinning ear to ear all through L.S.D.  You can hear his voice crack with JOY on that Poignient encore.  I have been addicted, hopelessly addicted to the Dead ever since.  The peak of the show was GDTRFB through Lucy.   This show has the best Stagger Lee and easily the best Crazy Fingers I have ever heard and I think I've heard them all?  Box of Rain sent the old timers into a frenzy and from that moment on the band at everyone's complete attention.  I rank this show as top 3 of the 90's and Top 10 all time.  (Of course my top 10 has about 60 shows :) )\n\nI am ever Grateful I was so lucky this was my first show.",

Toward the end of the show one of the Dead's crew came over and said they had never seen anyone exude so much love and joy and asked if I'd like to come back stage.  I hung out with Phil and smoked a couple fatties with him.  He asked me what I thought about his playing and I said it was really nice, because , you know, it was REALLLLLLY nice...LOL!!!!!  Then a couple of the girls that had been sitting around listening to one of Bobby's political rants and waiting for him to take them to his dressing room came over to me and I took them to my car and we did it until we couldn't see straight (which wasn't long...actually).

You came to the party late. You never saw Pigpen, you never saw the real deal 69-74 shows, not to mention '76 and of course '77. Thanks for stating the obvious about the 90's shows. But putting this show in the context of what they were capable of in '93, it's damn good. Sorry it's not as good as one of their \"awesome\" shows you saw in '84 or 85, which by the way was as hit or miss as anything in the 90s. Some really bad nights in the 80's.",
