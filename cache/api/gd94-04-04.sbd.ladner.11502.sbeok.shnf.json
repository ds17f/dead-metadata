Then, the cops chose to punish those who had been inside (and had nothing to do with the problems) by blocking all routes to the interstate and routing all exiting traffic into a bad neighborhood instead.

They made up for it the next day by playing an awesome Help->Slip->Franklins and Terrapin Station was amazing.

      "review_text": "Apocalypse Dead This was my last attempt to participate in the GD experience and it was utter disaster. I waited in line for tickets weeks before and was sabotaged by the \"lottery system\". When I did head downtown just to groove with the Heads and hopefully find a miracle, I found an abundance of scalpers and Feds running around in Tie-dyes(there were as many Drug agents as vendors working the crowds around Lake Eola)There was too much negative energy attached to the whole scene at that point: The music became secondary to the drugs. Many who attended shows didn't even care what or who was playing as long as they could score with some hippie chick and get wrecked on whatever was available in the parking lot. It's true I am still a little bitter. To make a long story short I inadvertently got caught up in the ugly police riot scene with the tear gas & billy clubs & helicopters...talk about a buzz kill especially under the influence of hallucinogenics. Although my love for the Dead prevented me from writing them off completely at that point, i never made any attempt to attend another show after this and for years after Jerry passed away I nearly quit listening to any Dead music. This site and some other motivators have reignited my appreciation and reestablished my connection to what always mattered, the music. I am grateful once again to be reminded of how truly amazing and special the phenomenon of the Grateful Dead is. As to what was going on inside,I finally have the opportunity to \"attend\" this show in spirit. I am glad that the paranoid aggression and chaos going on outside did not hold sway over the performance within the O-rena that day. I can't ignore the irony in the song choice for the encore. I also cannot really give an objective rating to the show so I give a 3 based on the other reviewers.",

If not you can hear it in his vocals. It was a very touchoing encore. Very appropriate.",

      "review_text": "GREAT music...BAD scene I completely agree with much of what others had written about this show.  I had been telling a friend of mine for years that he needed to go to a Dead show with me to experience the great vibes and the laid back hippie culture.   What happens?  He gets totally ridiculed by the heads, you know all the 'tie-dye diapers' comments.  We couldn't score at all cause we didn't 'look the part' - I guess we had showered too recently (I had been going to shows on and off for ten years btw).  Everyone looked very wired and desperate.  At every turn there were what seemed like a trillion 14 year old runaways hounding us for our tickets.\nFinally a pack of them confronted us on the way in saying we were fake and should give up our tickets to the 'real heads'.  I realize that a lot of heads were let down because of the previous night's concellation - but I had never been threatened at a dead show before.  It was pathetic.\nThe show itself was rockin.  Nice Jerry fretwork in Help>Tower - but don't I recall correctly that they actually opened up with something else but Bobby couldn't remember the chords.  Brown eyed women brought a tear to my eye.  Somewhere along about the second set my buddy turns to me and goes, \"So, when are they gonna play 'Truckin'?\", you know, like they play the same set every night and it includes their greatest hits or something.\nI laughed histerically, and as I was trying to think of a way to even begin to explain the Bobby vs. Jerry & sometimes Phil = a setlist on the fly that rarely includes truckin or darkstar phenomenon, the boys break-in with the first bluesy strains of their only hit.\nI spent a lot of the second set trying to prepare my friend for the parking lot after.  He's like, \"I dunno man, it seems like if you aren't already in their crowd, they aren't going to accept you - they're kind of snobby and a little threatening.\"\nI finally convinced him by about the time 'I faught the law' cranked up that, no, they aren't at all violent, they're very peaceful, accepting folks.....\nSo we walk out of the O'rena and see where the heads had ripped the handles off the doors, the cops in full riot gear, helicopters circling and the smell of cs gas still in the air.\nHe's like, \"Yeah, right.\"\nDefinitly a low point  - and to you heads who were so insufferably mean-spirited - shame on you.",

The scene with the cops was bad even before the show started. You had to give it  to Billy for playing after his loss. Music is the best medicine some times. The opener is alittle loose but the Slipknot! is notable, it is long and  jammed out. You can  hear an enormous cheer from the audience during Franklin's, I can't recall what  happened. BE Women, Masterpiece,  Jerry's  vocal harmonies are sweet, and Loose Lucy are very good.The second set features a Truckin'> Terrapin that is excellent.The bridge from Lady with a Fan is amazing. The D/S into Days is also quite good, Jerry plays a  viliant version, with only a couple minor flubs with the lyrics. The T-Stones is amazing. By the encore word was  out that something happened outside. It was sad and  shocking and we got right the fuck out of there. The Farm ended up being a cool oasis after the chaos.",

I remember watching the local news about the scene with the chief of police saying it was a good test for them to be prepared for the upcoming World Cup Soccer tournament.

      "review_text": "Jumping Jack Flash. . . There were SO many cops ! I mean EVERYwhere !!!! Cops on every form of transportation imaginable, you name it. Roller blade cops ? Yep, they had them too ! Bicycles, jet ski's, boats (for a small lake) 4X4's, motorcycles, horse back, walking, scooters, under cover, helicopter, dogs I mean EVERYwhere !!! They must have bussed them in from Miami !! It was almost like the air was static with this inevitable showdown before it even happened for such an overt police presence ? The tear gas I will never forget walking out of the venue into that bedlam, witnessing it from the stairs 'I Fought The Law' the boys inside HAD to have known ? Come on ? What were they to do though, ya know ? Stop the show and make it worse ? They were prolly told by Otown 'Finish, and take your freaks with you' ! They never did play Orlando again, but instead next spring Tampa, my last show.\n It was bad, and sadly I remember mothers with small babies etc. man-handled by the cops on foot, in full riot gear, with horse backup freaking out in the choking gas. People were seperated, families, rides, and everyone just pushed OUT ! Told to leave the area weather you were safe or not, cars driving through the lot, it was Nuts! The horses were obviously stressed too, and I remember the drummers coming to the aid of one bystander who had fallen, surrounding them in a circle beating the police back with drum so the fallen could escape. It was chaos !! \n I did head north up 441 to the Farm ! Can't remember for the life of me where or who but thank you. Some kind heads out there had fields and private property that was away from the chaos. As another reveiwer wrote, I too remember a dim light with music being played down by some trees, but otherwise I just chilled the night in the lot and, strange I remember frying, waiting in line for what seemed like hours to get in, just sweating while peaking, but dont remember the sun coming up and leaving. Or where we went ? Were they ever there at all ? But we kept on dancing . . . \n\nGot home, and the next day Kurt Cobain died.",

      "review_text": "Heaven and Hell I hardly know where to begin.  Well I was 31 at this show.  It was the farthest I'd ever traveled to see the GD.  I went down to FL from NH, for the Easter Sunday, my Birthday show which as we all know got cancelled!!  What a drag, but we ended up in a campground and i went for a walk on this cool trail and I thought to myself how awesome it would be to see a couple of deer.  When I got to the end of the trail there was a picture post-card lagoon and two deer just standing there!! Happy Birthday to me :) So the next night I had a single seat practically in the middle of the floor!  Shaq was still playing for Orlando, and when I went in to the show I said, \"Normally this is Shaq's floor, but tonight it's mine.\" The place was plush!!  Ushers using flashlights to light the stairs as you walked onto the floor, thick cushy seats!! hehe  Well careful what you wish for.  It was the most intimate I'd ever been with the band, I felt like nobody else was in the audience.  It was my official night that made me a pure Deadhead.  As I started to feel like the 60's, i focused on the drums and Mickey looked at me and nodded and wiped his forehead, and noticing my forehead was sweaty, I followed his lead which made him smile.  Then during Brown Eyed Women, Jerry cocked his head and sang right to me for almost the rest of the night.  During Terrapin, I looked over at the soundstage and everyone was looking at me and smiling!!!!  I guess it was my time to shine and I've never felt so happy!!!  Heaven.\n\nLeaving the show I found my friend and we walked out hand in hand.  The first thing I'd heard was, \"Don't come over here they've set off a bomb!\"  And several people were on the ground puking.  My first reaction was to go help them but then my skin started to burn.  Every pore in my body was open, shirt covered in sweat.  Eyes started to burn and I took my shirt to wipe them which was a big mistake.  At that point I still didn't know what kind of bomb had been set off (later learning it was tear gas) and started to freak a little.  Just then a group of people i'd met at the campground the day before came walking by completely normal.  I asked if their skin was burning and they said no.  And then they walked away.  My thought, so this is a bad trip!!!  But just then, a 15 foot Fl State Trooper go out of his car in full gas mask and riot gear.  I grabbed my friends hand and ran as fast as we could. Coming around the front of the arena, everything was normal.  People were leaving the show as if nothing was going on.  I saw the twelve tribes bus and knew they were medical.  We went there and they explained everything to me and washed my eyes out lol.  Baptised by the Joshua's.  Anyways the boys obviously knew what was going on.  When everyone tried to rush the doors we heard a huge commotion but had no idea what it was.  One other cool thing,  i thought it was the end of the first set and was kinda freaking about the intimacy with the band and boogied off the floor to find my friends only for them to start Cassidy.  I stopped at the inner concourse and this brother saw I was having a bit of a difficult time and tapped me on the shoulder, busted a turn and with all the grace in the world reached up and unscrewed a lightbulb!  He and I went around the concourse unscrewing bulbs until \"Don't Ease\" was over.  Peace everyone and I know it was 1994 but this show was SICK!!",

The campground we crashed at scared the hell outta Big Jim & a couple other tourin' buddies:  We all awoke not even 20 feet from actual gators!  After thankin' the heavens we were prepared for another show cancellation.  But the show must go on!\nAnd went on it did, the fellas in fine form & fettle.  I'll always remember some asshat on the way in trying to jump over & crowdsurf his way up the steps into venue over the turnstile.. Asshat caused myself & many others to miss most of _Help--->_ Such a shame.. But even though the \"scene\" had grown somewhat \"dark & mean;\" Jerry & crew could light up & get groovin' many an audience & venue staff member alike.  When everybody's tuned in & participatin' dancin' to the Owsley Shuffle, all was right in the world (if \"only for a minute or two\" West L.A. Fadeaway style).. \nThis tour was such a rad time, personally.\nWe really had it so bloody great back then!  Hopefully I don't believe I ever took the regular Dead & Jerry Band shows for granted.  I remember _everything!_ (lysergically speaking)\n\nThis archive evolution is tremendous!  Hopefully more sound checks & other interesting items like being able to hear the band talk to each other onstage during the show for the first time in '93 (?) @ Cal Expo run (they helped first develop in-ear monitoring systems in use today).  I have a 12 minute snippet that leaves me cravin' more!\nFor sound logical reasons (yet admittedly sentimental) and the fact I sat staring' & Jer-Bears Green Cordury pants imagining in my altered state how Garcia was the most naturally charismatic & truly gifted entertainer I've ever witnessed.  I rate this show 5 Stars, unfortunately with a tiny paper cup of Orange to wash it down (sic).  Sad personal goings on, with band & audience feedin' off our beloved Captain Trips like psychic vampires.  But so it goes (or so it went).  A Man & Band Truly \"beyond description.\"  All in all a great show (& tour) I'll never forget!  Remember:  The Sweet wouldn't be as sweet without a bit O' sour. This stream sounds great!",
