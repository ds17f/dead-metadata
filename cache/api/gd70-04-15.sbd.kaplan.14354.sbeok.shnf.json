      "review_text": "This show smokes I have no idea what the previous reviewer is saying, but this ain't a 4 star show.  The energy in this show just reaches out through the speaker and grabs hold of you from start to finish.  I'm normally lazy about writing reviews but every time I listen to this show I get pumped to write it up so here goes...\n\nAs some others have pointed out, the Jam in Other One is an absolute highlight, but the rest of the concert is pretty great.  If I had time travel this would be one of the 1970 shows I would make sure I saw live.\n\nCold Rain & Snow sizzles from the start and sets the tone for what's to follow.  I love this song and this version is at the top of my list of favorites.  There's a short scream at the end which perfectly sums up the way you'll be feeling after you've heard it.  Mama Tried, Man's World and Candyman are all excellent versions which keep the momentum going.\n\nThen they launch into a Hard to Handle which has only one flaw.  The recording is cut short and fades part way through the jam.  It starts off very strong  and the jam that ensues is so grooving you wonder if what we're missing is something like what took place on 8/6/71.  It sure feels that way.  \n\nNext is a great version of Cumberland, one of my favorite dancing songs, that stands up to the great one played 2 weeks later at Harpur.  But it's the Other One suite that follows which makes you really pay attention.  Unique as far as I know because of a rocking jam they insert between drums and the thundering bass Phil usually starts them off with, it has to be experienced to be believed.  The energy comes from the drum solo (really from CR&S) which I normally can take or leave, but this one picks up a fire half way through that feels like the band just couldn't wait to layer something on top.  The Jam that follows is unlike anything I've heard.  Maybe a mix of the frenetic Other One and a Spanish jam.  It's the motivation for me typing this review.  Then as if that wasn't enough a great Other One follows.\n\nThe rest of the concert rocks too - an excellent version of Dancin, especially for those who don't always love the screechiness of the early version vocals because they're a bit softer here.  But I want to highlight one more thing which no one has mentioned yet...\n\nLovelight!   After a good start that segues into a short snappy Not Fade Away, they return.  Pig is groovin but doesn't have the energy to take them higher.  So what happens?   Those of you who like to bash Bob or don't like his screaming might not love this as much as I did, but Pig is heard saying into the mike as part of his rap:  \"a little bit of help, need a little help, Oh Bobby, got some help for me?\".  This leads to a vocal exchange that soars as first Bobby joins Pigs mellow groove without missing a beat, then starts to take the lead.  He does this with incredible feel, raising the energy with a slow burn the way Jerry does so often with his guitar.  Next thing you know Bobby is yelling into the mike with Pig wailing in the background, and they continue taking turns for several minutes ending in a vocal crescendo that is off the charts.  \n\nFor those wondering where Bobby got the chops to take on Lovelight on his own years later, this is the earliest evidence I've found.  \n\nEnjoy",

One of the best and most powerful versions to date, the thunderous mind-melting power of OO dissolves into the gentle loving caresses of a Cryp Reprise that's sweet yet spacy.\n\nOther highlights: Man's World, DANCIN' (holy smokes, they take a 50s R&B tune to Neptune and back), and one of the best LLs to come along in quite some time.\n\nThis needs to be released, I think, now that it's not downloadable anyway.

Beginning with the Cold Rain & Snow opener this recording reveals the band sharp, focused and at the peak of their abilities.  There is so much to recommend about this recording that I will only touch on a few highlights. If this Hard To Handle was not cut, it would rival 8/6/71 as perhaps the finest ever played! I am of the opinion that It's A Man's Man's World from this show IS the best version the band played, and Pigpen is at his very best this night. If you love Pigpen then this is your kind of show. Pigpen even adds some pretty good keyboards.\n The jam after. Cryptical>Drums is one to bookmark if you want an example of true improvisation on the part of this band, They had never to my knowledge done this before or after when joining Cryptical>Drums to The Other One. The band just goes off on instinct and find themselves hurled into a Santana-esque jam out of drums before settling into a blistering version of The Other One. This is \"must-hear\" stuff. The Dancing In The Streets has to be on the short list of \"best ever\" versions, if not on the top of all the pre-disco arrangements of this song. It covers a whole lot of ground and has that perfect \"Tighten-Up\" jam the band played so well in 1970. Just when you think it's winding down Jerry picks it up and takes the song over to a whole other level when you least expect it. \nThe Lovelight>NFA>Lovelight closer is the icing on the cake of an incredible show at Winterland!",

The Airplane were next, and played a great set, but my friends and I were convinced Quicksilver would be the best band this night.  Then the Dead changed our opinion right out of the box with a great Cold Rain and Snow, followed by Weir yelling back to us.  The rest of the music was great, particularly the Cryptical/Jam/Other One, and Dancin.  There is a lot of speculation that other players were in on the jam.  I don't remember anyone else playing, but I will never forget David Crosby standing with the roadies and others behind the Dead, with the most blissed out smile the whole time.

I mean, his voice is always crackly and he don't hit notes all that good.  He couldn't play piano either, which I think hurt them in the early years and it's why everybody thinks late 70's Dead is way way better.  Keith was really good, but Brent was a burn out and always sounded dumb to me.  I never like Brent.  To my mind, Bruce Hornsby should've joined and they kick Pipgen out.",
