But don't forget about the post drums segment, the segue from China Doll into The Wheel is smooth and they really rock out NFA.\n\nMickey's exgirlfriend Jerry Lee Bradeleis was in town promoting her book and was on the local radio after this show just raving.  She said she had not seen energy like this from these guys in a while and that they were very tired after the show.  It showed the next night.",

Listen well to the Drums/Space this night, it will blow you away. \n\nThen we ended up staying in a suite in a nearby Hilton. The hotel was overrun by Deadheads.

The ovation went on for another couple of minutes: even on the SBD copy of the show you can make out the crowd.  \n\nOther highlights: just before the first verse of Wheel, Bill dropped his drumstick and it fell forward towards Bobby.  Without missing a beat, Bob picked it up and tossed back and then made it back to the microphone just in time . . . \n\nBob mucks up one of the verses of Throwing, so he decides to go back and re-sing it.  They pull it off so well that it seems like that's how the song was written . . .\n\nThe first set might go down as my favourite of the post-Brent era.  Ya maybe I'm biased because  I was there, but I've heard most of the 90's shows and this one rocks.  Do not even hesitate downloading this show.",

They musta loved playin' this venue, b/c with the exception of maybe the 1990 run when they should have spent more time recuperating and reorganizing after Brent passed, the 91, 92, 93, and 94 runs were all pretty darn amazing. I do remember the venue sounded pretty awesome and the crowd would get WAY into it...Good ol' Midwest Dead shows. In terms of sound quality and performance, this is a solid 5 stars for sound and a 5- for performance.",

Couldn't really get into post-'82 until after Brent had died and hated post-Brent until recently.  Fall '91 is very solid and I haven't heard a duff Richfield show yet.  The mix for this show is very good, some folks are more out front than others.  Jerry alternates between nice'n'loud and not there, but that has more to do with what he is doing than the mix itself.  The playing is excellent, not super-solid throughout but Jerry is 'on' and 'there' which makes for an anything-can-happen type of show.  Phil seems interested for the most part with infrequent periods of plodding around.  The Scarlet>Fire is a highlight.  Check out the Promised Land, seriously.  The whole band is just *screaming*, really leaning into it and giving it everything they've had, never heard one like it.  Everyone is pounding away and clanging and crashing and ripping chords and notes like mad, it is total musical chaos, but everyone is in tune and in time.  Nice.  It's a great board, and I'm also checking out all the newly posted auds from this period too.  Sound: 4 / Show: 4.  A few years ago I'd have called this the best board I'd ever heard but not everything can be a 5...",

And long, too.  There are many many strong points to this show.  However, my absolute favorite part is how loud Bobby is.  I got the board on cassette shortly after the show, and it's exact.  Bobby is turned UP.  I like it b/c you get a feeling for how sweet he is at rhythm guitar.  Plus, you have Hornsby on the piano.  Surely a welcomed sound.  Very full.  Bruce on Walkin Blues makes the whole tune.  Bobby on Jack Straw and Jack-A-Row is so strong.  Not to mention him during the 2nd set.  This show is sweet on many levels.  I think this show should be a Dick's Picks.",

Inspiration, dedication, whatever, Brent was on their minds.  The mix of this show is nearly, if not perfect making it a pleasure to listen to over and over...loud.  The boys were on fire.  Their timing was right on, Jerry's leads were ripping pulling off high high peaks.  Bobby's rhythm and Bruce's keys fill your ears with harmony.  In my opinion it is the best Scarlet->Fire ever.  You think ah, come on but what about...but I remember it clear as day.  That show moved everyone there.  This show should be the next View from the Vault.  Forget Dick's picks, I have the board.

Possibly one of the worst versions of the song I've ever heard.  Tennessee Jed & Black Throated Wind are also kinda fast & clunky (those songs never had the same impact on me post-Brent).  I think the band pulls some control back together with Cold Rain & Promised Land.  When they come back for Set 2, it's much better.  Scarlet > Fire is pretty sick.  The rest of the show is pretty good, too.  Always love He's Gone.  My biggest rave about this show is Bob's guitar volume - LOVE it when he's loud.  Also, I did get to sit 10th row on the floor right between Jerry & Bruce.  Pretty cool.",

When they left, they wished us a \"good show\". That's the first time that'd ever happened, and I saw it as a good omen. We were not disappointed. \n\nBut we were so high up on the side of that coliseum that we thought we could almost fall vertically if we slipped. Though daring, the dancing was still great. \n\nThis was one of those \"most beautiful shows\". I recall nothing sonically or musically that wasn't pure bliss. And, yeah, Bob's guitar was right out front, and that's so much fun. And I'm confident that the band brought back Brent or Pigpen or Keith with \"He's Gone\". Maybe all three. \n\nFrom on high the people down on the floor of the arena looked like a sea of old southern Blacks down by the river for baptism. It was a profoundly spiritual show. I remember the Drums came right up out of the Ganges, very Indian. \n\nI've only recently discovered this website and these collections, and am starting to troll for shows I went to.

Other than that this show just seems to lay there, run of the mill average at best. Being a huge fan of Scarlet>Fire after reading the reviews I was ready to really enjoy this one. But it lacks Jerry energy his solos are weak with no real emotion. So  many  other great versions are out there. No Jam after He's Gone makes this a lazy end to post drums. China Doll is always good but this one lacks real depth in the solo section and the transistion into Wheel is not smooth; more start and stop than flowing. The sound quality is great but the music is not, over blown hype. Not a badly played show just rather weak and average at best",

If you have, let me know, I\u2019d like to hear it. The Scarlet -Fire is a post Keith-Donna top 10. It absolutely smokes from the first note to the last. It\u2019s also the ONLY time I ever saw Jerry walk away from his between song smoke to take a bow. Even HE knew they\u2019d nailed it. If you listen to the audience tapes, that secondary roar you hear is the crowd responding to Jerry walking up to the front of the stage and tipping his cap, if he\u2019d been wearing one. Anyone who poo-poos this Scarlet-Fire is just being silly. The rest of the show was outstanding as well with enough energy to lift the roof off Richfield. Remember, this was the tour opener, so the boys were rested and ready and it shows. Also, Bruce spent the entire night kicking Jerry in his ass. Listen to it with an open mind and open ears. It\u2019s all there.",
