There are so many highlights from the year that it ranks for me as one of their peak periods.  And this show is definitely one of the best.  Warning - It's got that tough, aggressive sound that puts off some.  But if you want high energy from the drop then this is it.  Jerry's voice has that great phlegmy/rough sound; his guitar is like ice and he's on fire; Bobby hits his guitar like a bell; and Brent is always right on.  Don't know if it's the best Sugaree because I haven't heard them all, but it's one of the best I've heard.  The set list is kinda funny too.  I had this tape in the late 80s and always thought it was mixed up.  Sugaree to open?  Not right.  Hell in a Bucket in the middle of the first set?  Strange.  Yeah, it's easy to get a 5 star rating, but this one deserves it.  Turn it up.",

The band is firing on all cylinders most notable Jerry is who is on point as he was in Hartford two nights earlier.  Its weird, 10/15/83 and 10/17/83 are more dicks picks worthy than the white bread show they chose on the 14th...83 was a strange year. Jerry got real bloated and clearly took some nights off but when he was on the band followed his lead.  This Sugaree is a prime example...enjoy.",

Not to mention the sound quality is incredible.  You'll hear just enough of the crowd and plenty of the band, much better then a board recording could ever sound.  The recording really brings out Jerry going the extra mile for us vocally on many of the tunes.  And of course his playing is on point.  \n\nMy vote also goes to this Sugaree as best ever.  But don't just download that, get the whole thing.",

      "review_text": "Push back, push back, push back the night. If you're like me, then you find Sugaree (and Row Jimmy) to be ultra monotous and boring, regardless of how well it's played.  For me, Sugaree could never be the highlight of any show. Most times, the reverse was true.  Guys with similar tastes to mine will take one look at a Sugaree, Rooster, FOTD opener and probably keep looking for something else.\n\nSTOP!  Don't let those first 3 dogs scare you.  This show IS worth it.  Don't be swayed by previous reviews that claim the best songs of the night were the two mellowest songs.  There's way more to this show and I'm here to rattle the consensus.  Touch of Gray is a bummer to get as a 2nd set opener, but this one is great because it shows a song in transition both vocally and musically.  The Samson totally rocks.  To Lay Me Down is mellow but at least it's not uber-repetetive like Sugaree.  It's selling point is it's rarity but there is some nice guitar work on it that can't be denied.  Women Are Smarter rocks as usual, and the Terrapin is really strong, probably the highlight of the show up to this point.\n\nThis is one of my favorite post-Space song lineups.  Although Wheel, Miracle, GDTRFB, and Good Lovin are all \"post drums\" songs, rarely were all 4 played in the same set.  All 4 of these versions rock, but particularly strong is the Good Lovin.  If you like the \"push back the night\" rap Bobby was doing in 83, then you'll LOVE this version of GL.  I believe it to be the best \"push back the night\" Good Lovin I've ever heard.\n\nI'd give this show 5 stars, but the 1st set setlist killed it for me (regardless of how well it was played).  For those like me who never really got into the mellow songs.... the best two songs of the night were Terrapin and Good Lovin.",

The vibe from the very beginning was positive.  One could walk around the hockey arena hassle free.  During Wheel, there was a circle of fans holding hands and going around the upper level until the entire level was connected. Lake Placid or as we called it at the time, \u00c3\u00c2Lake Acid,\u00c3\u00c2 has always been one of the top 3 Dead shows I had the pleasure of attending.  This show definitely is of the \u00c3\u00c2It\u00c3\u00c2s not what they played, it\u00c3\u00c2s how they played it\u00c3\u00c2 genre.  Thank you!",

Jerry just keeps turning it up higher and higher, and the boys are right there with him with some exceptionalo work by Bobby wrapping around Jerry's lead.  Segues right into rooster without a thought.  Bobby is especially strong.  FOTD slows it down a notch but the song is beautiful and does have a nice jam.\n\nBrother Esau is a nice version of this song, and Bird Song is pretty standard but with some fine playing.  Followed by an unusual Hell in a Bucket, somewhat stripped and raw.  Deal closes the set very strong and powerful with extended jam. \n\nWith such an awesome, energetic first set, I was very dissapointed in the second.  What did they do during the intermission, 'cause there is no energy left.  I labored through the entire set, draining all of the joy from the first.  Only during Good Lovin does any energy come through at all.  Don't get me wrong, much of the playing is alright, but almost feels like the show was recorded from two different nights, there is no consistency at all.\n\nRevolution encore standard, but answer me this:  Dear Prudence one of the all time great great great covers, why can't Jerry seem to nail any other Beatles tune?\n\nDownload the first set and get in Bronzed for eternity's sake, and listen to it everyday.  Forget the second set and take a walk instead.",

E: Revolution.\n\nThis show had the unfortunate honor of being on the heels of the first two \"St.Stephen\" shows from MSG and Hartford. Also, it came the year the band revived Help>Slipknot! It's a shame that this one gets overlooked. Certainly the first set is a must have for some stellar versions AND the \"audience factor\". \n\n(For another awesome audience/energy show from '83, check out the \"mud slide\" show from Merriweather 6/20/83.)\n\nThe 2nd set is average. But if you're like me and can feel the energy of a 1st set, download it.\n\nI know the purpose of the reviews is to comment on the show only, but I was stunned to read a derogatory comment (in general) on Sugaree and Row James. I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe Rooster IS a cooker...picks up where Sugaree left off. \nBut if Birdsong could have been placed in the Second set...it should have been this night.\nLong intro...possibly Jerry toying with the E-chord waiting for Bobby? No matter.\nThis is a definitive Birdsong. Are there better, sure. But you have to put this one in a top 5 category. Very spacey and exploratory.\n\nBucket is so much different than the versions that were played when the Dead went \"Top 40\" in '87. Very energetic and \"raw\". \n\nDeal,as someone already noted, smoked. It is Jerry bursting with energy that is so positive, that I, too, wondered why the second set was lacking, in a relative way.\n\nWho knows. Get the first set...feel the energy of the audience. Enjoy.\n\n\nI give the first set 5 stars.",

I would like to say high to all those that i attended this show with, Amy Smith, Boogie, and the others ... it was my first, riding the back of a pickup truck to and from Plattsburg College, a freshman, going to the show, shrooms, the whole event - basically changed my perception of music and of life - so my review is biased for sure ... but not so ridiculous. \n\nI guess it begins with not knowing the dead ... at the time ... and ends with being pressed against the front row stage security pit rail ... right in front of Jerry. I actually am one that did not jive too well with set #1. I got excited but was less 'connected' ... but when i met a college buddy, and he sneaked me to the floor for the second set, and we weasled to the front row ... magic happened for me. A pivotal moment in time when I transcended to a new appreciation of jam rock - it was a moment of complete glee and transformation. \n\nI loved terrapin and good lovin in particular. Terrapin spoke to me ... and I can still see the rosey images of Jerry and Bobby singing the epic 'story like' lyrics, as if dripping and echoing in that olympic playground of ice, the visuals and context is mind shattering for me. \n\nI have listened to this - my first show - many a time, on scratchy old tapes, and i still love hearing again today, at 40yrs old, 3 kids, wife, etc ... thinking back to how this event changed me forever, how the my apreciation of the rhythm, timber and feel of bird song, deal, esau, terrapin, good lovin, and all the others ... started in Lake Placid, in the northern reaches of NY, the ADKs, it has helped define who i am and how i perceive life and music. \n\nSo to all 'invovled' in the details of set #1 ... sugaree etc, good for you all, but i return occasionaly to place of memory that is in set #2, where life changed for me in that hour ... that slice of time ... that immense impact ... that moment when i first connected with the boys ... there are only a few times in life like that. \n\ngod bless, and keep jamming and searching for that sweet note ... that serenity riff, it is out there if you really look for it ... in life and music. \n\ndon palahnuk",

Jerry is all over the place and is trying so hard to find his notes he reminds me of George Bush at his last press conference.  Sad.\n\nGo listen to the Sugaree at the 5-28-77 Hartford show to hear the song done right.  I'm not sure it's even been done better than that.  There's a version at the Greek from '82 that is probably the best in the Brent era.  It sure the hell isn't this refried cheeseball here.\n\nThe best taste of the quality of the recording may be the To Lay Me Down in the 2nd set.  It's a nice latter-era version of the tune but the second half of the solo is muffed (not sure who to blame for that).\n\nI'm not aware of a single Bird Song post-73 that matters for a hill of beans.  This one is mundane.\n\nThe Deal is nice but, like the Sugaree, is an exercise in excess that gets fairly tedious.
