      "review_text": "\"Ain't it just like the night\" With the announcement of the 30 years of the GD  boxed set and discovering that this would be the final show I had to give it a revisit.\n\nYes I have listened to the version of Visions from this night countless times as it is possibly the best version they ever played but I am  getting ahead of myself here.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the overall performance  played on this winter night back in Utah.\n\nThe first set is really quite enjoyable and  features a   very rare  opener to commemorate the run in Salt Lake The band is loose and ready to have a  good night.\n\nFOTD is very sweet and sets the stage for the rest of the evening. Wang  Dang is tight and full of buesy rawness.\nTennessee Jed is   very good as Jerry is in fun spirits and really gives  the Jed that extra  kick.\n\nBroken Arrow is a perfect  choice as  Phil sang a song every night this run. The entire bands elevates this one to greatness.\n\nBT Wind features  sweet licks from Jerry and Bobby crooning about life on the road with a broken heart.\n\nYou get a   very  solid, and possibly over looked, reading of So Many Roads. It is not as powerful as other versions from the fall of '94 but it is a keeper for  sure.\n\nBob lays down a  joyous Music Never Stopped to end the set. Vince is  really strong on this night and he  really found his sound by this year, the  electric piano  , and it is much  more harmonious than it was back in 1991.\n\nSet  II is all about Jerry and he launches off with a  great Foolish Heart that features a  couple  minor vocal flubs but the  band really gets in the groove and Jerry  steps up and plays some magical stuff.\n\nSamba is quite good and  Vince has some great fun on it.\n\nThe  band  launches into a  joyous sing-a-long Truckin' that is text  book perfect and features strong Phil harmonies and  a nice peak and a  short  jam that drops into a  fun surprise of  I Just Want to Make  Love to You, which had not  been played since the fall of 1984 in Worcester and of coarse was sung by Brent.\n\nI was at that show and we were blown away by that one which features an  off the rail jam, this one is more delta  blues and Jerry really has  fun with it and offers  up some fun  vocals and some  nice finger pickin'. This slides into That Would Be Something ,which is became a favorite of  Jerry in the final years.\n\nThe appeal of this song is more of the tip of the hat to Paul and irony. Jerry was  big on irony if you have not guessed by now yet.\n\nThe Drumz are incredible and  you  know something special is still  ahead of us. The  Space is  good but not nearly as intense but  guess what?\n\nThe  glistering opening notes of Vision of Johanna come out of the darkness into the light and wow ! Jerry  blows opens that glorious day glo covered  door one more time.\n\nIt is simply Jerry doing what Jerry does  best.... crooning the mastery of Bob Dylan and matching the music note for note perfectly.\n\nFor a  me  not ever seeing this song live, it will always be a great regret for me.\n\nJust listen and be with Jerry and the band and let them carry you away.\n\nThe end the set with a rousing and strong Sugar Magnolia and it features a  strong SSDD but some awful static through the main PA mars the ending.\n\nI do  hope the CD version cleans that  up.\n\nAs for  Liberty, the second most dreaded encore of the  1990's this one is perfect as Jerry, who loved singing it, is a joy to listen to as he  sings with irony, regret and humor one of Robert Hunter's most dismissed songs of the entire catalog.\n\n\"If I was the sun, I'd look for shade\nIf I was a bed, I would stay unmade\nIf I was a river I'd run uphill\nIf you call me you know I will\nIf you call me you know I will\"",

      "review_text": "haunting Visions I was lucky to be at this show.  The irony of the GD in Utah was enjoyable as was the relaxed setting compared to the mayhem of stadium shows, and skiing at Snowbird the days before.\n\nThis features my favorite Visions Jerry offers a gorgeous, chilling and haunting reading. The guitar solo is more developed than the 3-18-95 version. They had problems with the mix and hearing it now through good headphones really brings it to life.\n\nThe review by @Stellablu122 is right on the mark. Besides Visions, the other highlight for me is the run of:\n\nBroken Arrow (best version I heard live)\nBT Wind (Sharp and punctual, with Bobby on acoustic)\nSo Many Roads",

      "review_text": "30th Trip Around the Sun This is a good '95 show. Still, there are definitely better shows in the year. First set is, I guess, well enough played. Salt Lake City must've been a treat; Jerry following it up with FOTD, too (\"spent the night in Utah\"). Otherwise, I enjoyed the acoustic BTW, always love SMR (even if this version is a little shaky). Vince sounds good, throughout, and the closer, TMNS, while a little sleepy at first, picks up steam midway and toward the end. \n\nThe second set jam sequence - nearly forty minutes - from Truckin' through to Visions is the definite show highlight. Following Truckin' there's a couple rarities, with I Just Want To Make Love To You->That Would Be Something, that segues into an excellent 22 minutes of drums/space. Sweet transition into a beautiful rendition of Visions, appropriately featured on the 30 trips definitive live story. \n\nAll in all, it's a good show. By '95 standards, even great. Unique set list and Garcia truly sounds great - for any era - on that Visions. Deadbase ranks this show at 12 for 1995's \"Favorite Tapes.\"",

      "review_text": "One of the top 5 star 95 shows I'm going to admit that I have not listened to this show in a while, but way back in the 00s when I first learned how to download multiple soundboards off of the archive using one of those file protocol transfer deals, I would download multiple shows a day and my goal was to First have a spool of burn CDs for each year of the '90s that had the top half a dozen to dozen shows of that year. I started with 95 because prior to those days, my dead bootleg collection pretty much stopped with the one or two 94 shows I had. I think I remember getting some 95 dead off of the Grateful Dead hour onto a cassette... but to finally have access to all the shows on the archive was a real treat! Anyways, I used the reviews that were already there to comb through all of the 1995 shows and find the ones that I wanted to download, and that's how I found this show. I will say, it definitely stood up to relistens and became one of my favorite shows to go to. The Friend of the Devil on here is absolutely Exquisite and it is definitely my favorite version that I've ever heard them play from any year. The Foolish Heart is really awesome as well and it's a showcase of this really great group sound the that band was evolving into by 95, and the audio mix of 95 which really changed the way the drums sounded from any other year and also the way the bass is mixed in, really suits this group sound and I like it so much better in those Healy Ultra mixes from the late '80s and early 90s were the instruments are all separated and panned out and makes the band sounds so thin. Same thing with 94, very thin sound and then 93 just has a terrible mid-range sound to all the boards and there aren't that many that sound good, the only ones that do are from indoor shows. But these 95 mixes are probably the best mixes of the band ever and had Jerry not passed away I think the 95 - 96 sound would have been a really really awesome phase in their constantly evolving sound. You can definitely hear glimpses of it in some of these really great 95 shows and some of the songs and the Foolish Heart definitely shows it.  As for the songs, I could never do better than the reviewer below me that really broke it down, hats off to that review.  Ill mention that Space really shines for the first half or so, with Phil hooked into a midi bass sound patch that makes it sound like a sort of impromotu song.... ALSO , Jerry's vocal delivery on Visions shows how great Jerry,s voice was in 95 and because of that, he had many awesome vocal moments in these last tours.\n\nAfter listening to every show of 1995 for a project I've been working on for years, I've definitely noticed some things that I'm slowly being able to articulate with words. 5 stars for playing and 4 for sound... not sure why but the mix and sound on this board doesnt seem quite a \"full\" sounding as some others, but its still really great... nothinf a little EQ cant spice up...Okay on to the next 95 show!",

      "review_text": "Makes Des Moines look second rate <br />The final show of the only Utah run. This is known for being one of the top few shows of '95, for having four rarities, and for several songs being in their best-of-year versions. This SLC run was was a one-off and not part of the spring tour that began in March (in the East).\n\nFirst Set. They saved <i>Salt Lake City</i> for their final-ever Utah show \u2013 or Bobby was just able to finally nudge the guys. Not just a rarity, this is the only one. Must hear once. <i>Friend of the Devil</i> is arguably the best of the year, with intricate playing on top of a supportive tempo. The Heads had been waiting three nights to spend the night in Utah. That crackling chrome current connects to <i>Wang Dang Doodle</i>, likewise a late-era best. After a bouncy/plucky <i>Tennessee Jed</i>, the rest is average. Weir plays acoustic for <i>Black Throated</i>, recycling the \"just a disguise\" line from '90 (the very end is suddenly better). <i>So Many Roads</i>  eventually irons out and <i>Music Never Stopped</i> is just enough to leave 'em happy for the break.\n\nSecond Set. It takes a bit to approach X factor. Though <i>Samba</i> is tighter than most, it nonetheless sounds like it's still forming. <i>Truckin'</i> is the typical ... at first. Late in the jam is where the set starts to peak, and then they tranny into <i>I Just Wanna Make Love to You</i>. This is the first since 8Oct84. We have one from late '66, when Pigpen was singing it, and two that Brent led in '84, then this by Jer, the final one. When they were starting out in early '66 as a bar/club band, they frequently covered the Stones, and this was likely a setlist standard. That said, this version is much closer to the Muddy Waters original than the Stones, though there's no bridge, just the verses.   They then slide into the next rarity (relatively; there are 16 of these in '93&gt;'95), Sir Paul's <i>That Would Be Something. Drums</i> is a big version, and long, at 15\u00bdmins. Some of the elements in <i>Space</i> have been leveled on the OFF, so it's not as potent/dynamic as it was in person (or on the AUDs. A MTX would be good here, but SBDs are also better). The final rarity is <i>Visions of Johanna</i>. As much as they covered '60s Dylan, this was the first one since 22Apr86. We thought it was long gone. There were two in '86, then six in '95. This is neither the best nor the worst. There are only two songs after Space and before the <i>Liberty</i> encore, which is one of the more solid versions.\n\n<u>1st Set</u>: \u00a0C+\n<u>2nd Set</u>: C+\nOverall = 3 stars\n\nHighlights:\nSalt Lake City \u2013 okay, more historical than highlight\nFriend of the Devil \u2013 spent the night in X factor\nWang Dang Doodle \u2013 does not get much better\nTruckin'&gt;I Just Wanna Make Love to You&gt;That Would Be Something \u2013 a warm &amp; wonderful sequence\n\nSOURCES: The miller_114144 is the cleanest SBD. It has the channels switched. The noise at the end of That Would Be Something (and lesser noise in a couple other places) is not present on the multis/OFF. <b>30 Trips</b> has the whole show. Visions of Johanna is on <b>Definitive Live</b>.",
