Set 2 wsa slow with the \"new\" tunes, until the Scarlet Fire that were very well played.  One of my favorite Jams from Scarlet into Fire with the Midi raging hard of some kind of horn sound, and a strong finish to the more appropriate Fire.  Well played out of space, good Stella in particular ,and the Holiday acknowledgement US Blues to send us home.

Brent may not have been the greatest songwriter but he rocked on keyboard. As for this show, it was HOT in Kansas and the crowd was sweet. I believe it was their first time at that venue and the locals were truly a great crowd. Once the sun went down they played Stella Blue to a crystal clear, deep dark blue sky with the stars just starting to shine. One of my greatest memories of how the Dead played to the weather... What a blast. Four stars because the sound quality is nice, and Brent rocks on Foolish Heart at this show, too.",

Topless girls selling imports out of their cooler for $1, had to sell them all before they could go to the show, that's the fun of being a deadhead.  One in our group didn't have a tix, and like a miracle, she looked down on the ground and there was a tix.  The Wheel lasted so long we had to stop dancing and rest twice during the song, and that was with some help from the fungi.

I made a vow never to again get that screwed up at a show. The humidity was ridiculous and there was no shade. I could not beleive that people in the audience would fire off fireworks that went back on the people behind them. I thought the song mix was great with new ones mixed with old ones and the us blues encore was a great topper. I was definately hooked on there live shows after that, their albums were nice but you could not beat a live show for pure fun and energy. The audience on a whole was very polite to every one.",

It is an unusual amphitheatre in that there is no roof over the seats.  \n\nSecurty was a little harsh that day.  I distinctly remember waiting to go in while a security guard made a mom with baby in arms dump out the baby's formula - no outside liquids allowed!  \n\nThe US Blues encore was expected, perhaps too expected, but was welcome nonetheless.  Billy really nailed the Fire down.  His right foot made us all dance.  Very good show, the start of a summer of stadiums for me, all the way to Foxboro.",

The brent/jerry combo is what kept the bob weir cheese in check, all those years.  There literally was not a 'leader' in the band( maybe it was phil as he really always been the leader of the grateful dead through all the years).  This show shines in the second set because weir wasn't allowed to sing any songs in the solid psychadelic night on the 4th.  Lets face it, the band thought so as well, and that is why \"dosin at the knick' was released showcasing brent at the knickerbocker arena shows spring 90.  After brent died Jerry was forced into more of a leader role which i believe he dreaded.  He didn't want to be the leader.  So Bobby took over(in his mind) and his cheese was acceptable now that brent wasn't there to lay the smack down on his ass and keep him in check.  Weir and vince took the grateful dead levels of cheese to a whole new level of sold out sound and behavior, as well as new song formation and choices,between the two of them.  If I were Garcia, I eventually would have used again, as well, to put myself into a coma like state to deal with the direction that the band was goin in.  Don't blame jerry.  And when Brent died, it really was the beginning of the end.  \nas for the show, 5 stars.  lots of brent and jerry, very little Bob.  perfect.
