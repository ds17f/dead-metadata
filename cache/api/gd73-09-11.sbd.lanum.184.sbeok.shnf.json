First set is great throughout - excellent China->Rider, LLR and Playin' (nice wah work by Jerry).   2nd set is super-cool.  Martin Fiero jams his butt off, and doesn't overstay his welcome.  Great - and the DStar is adventerous, yet very accessible and friendly (other than towards the very end when Phil goes a little too over the edge for my taste).  But this goes into a very beautiful and mild, moving to extremely passionate, Morning Dew.  Great show - it would be a 6 on any other bands 5 point scale, but compared to other Dead shows, it's a 4 or 4.5 -- excellent show.",

      "review_text": "don't miss this! Once upon a time, before all the terrorist propaganda bullsh@@t began, Sept. 11th meant something different - Mickey Hart's birthday!! So when you've had enough of all the media fear mongering - get out this show and crank it up. Your state of mind will improve immediately!\nI've had this show in MP3 for years, but listening now to this SHN copy, I realize I had under-rated this fine show. Maybe not a top ten, but it still holds its own against heavy competition in 1973. The Set One is well played as usual, with standout versions of Loser and China>Rider. The first set Half Step is a surprise and delivered with plenty of honky-tonk funkiness. Jerry's playing and vocals are passionate.\nAnd then - -  what else? Another great 1973 Playin. This version, although a bit shorter than most in 73, is so good, it's nearly the high point of the show for me. At about 3 minutes, right after the vocals, Garcia wastes no time in getting down to jam business. He breaks out the wah wah, and gives us a very mellow and melodic jam, while Bill keeps up the fast shuffle. The space jam near the end is pretty and leaves you with a smile.\nSet Two begins with Sing Your Blues Away, and this would be the first show featuring the horn duo of Fierro and Ellis. All the following September shows included the horns on Sing Your Blues, Let it Grow, and sometimes Eyes. They were trying to promote the release of Wake of the Flood (Oct 1973) which featured those songs. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but listening back now, the horns seem to get in the way of the Dead's sound just a little. Still, they add a nice spice and make these September versions intereresting and different to hear.  Let it Grow is high energy all the way, and when the sax solos kick in - well this is about as jazz fusion as it gets for the Dead. Jerry delivers some blistering leads about halfway through, with the sax weaving around him. A strong version. Big River is done with plenty of fire and twang. Deal is laid back but tasty nonetheless. Then, the cosmic Kool Aid arrives!\nDark Star starts with a long mellow jam, featuring some very creative colors from Phil and Jerry. They don't even play the Dark Star theme until 9 minutes into the piece - which leads into - the verse? Wrong! The rhythm section starts up a fast riff, which is taken up by Keith, then Jerry, and we're off to Jamville again! And Bill's drum work here is just stellar as usual. Comparisons to Mitch Mitchell come to mind. Finally after 17 minutes of jams, Jerry brings in the verse, then Phil drops the bomb and they take you to the Phil Zone for a few minutes (watch your speakers folks) before landing you - still vibrating - into a gorgeous Morning Dew. Dew fans, this bud's for you - 12 minutes of Jerry giving it all he's got. Why his guitar didn't burst into flame I don't know. The quiet sections are breathtaking, the loud ones will make your hair stand up.\nAn encore would have been nice, maybe an UJ's Band. But as is, a very enjoyable show. Recommended, along with 9/21 and 9/26.\nenjoy,\nDr. Flashback :-)",

I know there is much confusion among a lot of the youth visiting and reviewing shows here on the archive.  Quite a bunch of the young newbies, for some reason, think this jam is Mind Left Body.  But it is NOT.  The boys played MLB jam during Dark Star or between The Other One and Spanish Jam, and even alone by itself in 1990-1991.  (For a great MLB jam, get 10/19/73, OKC Fairgrounds.)  \n\nAnyway, this particular China>Rider segue is special.  Actually, the entire medley is killer.  Other highlights for me are WRS>Let it Grow, and a mind blowing Dark Star.  Then there is DEW!!!  Whoa!  Check out Phil's thunder bass as they go into Jerry's first solo.  DAMN, this is sick....you may want to tourn down the bass levels if listening in the car or at home unless your system can take it.  This show is just f-ing superb all around.",

It's such a tasty SBD that it hurts when the AUD patch comes in (and it's a good AUD patch too).\n\nAnyhow, Morning Dew is unbelievable.  The whole show flows perfectly.  Great night for Jerry on this one!",

Unforgetable stuff.\n\nemail me at fieldhouse11277@hotmail.com happy to share with some good listeners",

Phil is just playing well into the groove and everything else that makes things good.  The 'banter' at this one definitely sent some people for a loop. They are very much playing together for this one, and there is great external collaboration.    Although I usually prefer '74 shows, this show has a really good feel to it.  \n\"happy, happy, happy, happy home\" at William and Mary has a touch of irony to it as well.",

The China/Rider segue is a bit mellow, but extremely well jammed, and Playin' is simply dynamite!\n\nA show for the Philophiles, Lesh is really throwing his weight around, and Dark Star, with plenty of twists and turns features some dangerous notes creating quite the unique Morning Dew.\n\nThis is a top ten show of 1973!",

Sing your Blues Away is very jazzy with sometimes honking sax. Dark Star into Morning Dew is epic. Starts out a very sweet, low-key DS but soons starts to swing out and then morphs into Phil Lesh bombs and feedback. Everything is played perfectly-definitely a keeper.

That was done with financialand direct support from the USA and its people. So, one could really say fuck the USA. But, I digrss, this show is killer as I sit here post \"Chicago\" waiting for the 2015 fall tour to be annpounced. Jerry would maybe say we sghouldnever forget 9/11/73, for thi sdhow and to rememberthose who died in Chile that day, and that the uS should mind its own business so we don't have another 9/11./01 due to everyone but some guy in Tennesee hating the USA in the worlds 191 countries.

The Wall of Sound, a much larger indoor place, new, extended songs, more jazz tinged and PHIL had fun playing big sounds. We liked it. The sax touches were alright; not as good as Branford Marsalis much later. They were evolving forward and any show with Playing in the Band, Dark Star and Morning Dew is a good one; these were great renditions. It was quite a long show with an O.K. Doug Sahm opening. Bobby's remark at the very end that they were going to play there tomorrow was unusual; we had to go back to D.C., but glad some could see them again. We saw a nice one in 1973.",
