After the \"look at it right\" verse, Weir chops and punctuates crisply, providing a great platform from which Garcia can launch.  His solo starts spot on, each note thought out.  On the next go-round,   he spends an entire verse strumming out chords.  You sense he may be building to something, but what?  \n\nSuddenly, he rips into an incredible, impossible riff at what feels like the 26th fret on his board.  What a jolt!  This is what the Allman Brothers called \"hittin' the note.\"  A glorious piece of eight in the Grateful Dead treasure chest.  \n\nWear a helmet.",

The last run in Scarlet by Jerry is unreal. What a groove on Fire again Jerry is lightning fast on this version and he adds impassioned vocals to the mix. The segue on this version in nuts. One of the top Scarlet>Fires for sure. A very nice Estimated with Jerry taking some nice turns rising and falling. Eyes is fast, but Jerry's solos lends an ethereal 74 quality to it also; a killer version. The jam at the end of the third verse shows how tight the band was at this time. Drums>Space>The Other One.  This is a serious Other One folks. Billy K and Mickey are pounding those drums for all their worth, Phil is dropping bombs all over the place, Weir is holding it down, and Jerry is just sailing in, over, and around a killer rhythm; it sounds like those reckless Other Ones of 69. Has to be one of the best Post Hiatus. A killer Wharf Rat follows. Jerry is just soaring on this solo. A killer Miracle with Jerry and Phil going bezerk. Casey Jones is ok and One More Sat Nite to go home. Also an excellent recording, you can hear the crowd clapping along, but the sound is right in front of you. Its like you're there FOB. \nAt this point its the end of the line for the Keith and Donna era, but the band showed no signs of letting up from their 78 efforts. You need this folks.",

I've been listening to this show for 20 years, from the same source as this, but alas we all just played our tapes to shreds.  Easy candidate for most adored Dead tape.\n\nOther reviewers are right: amazing quality for an Aud.  In my opinion, this is not only the best Scarlet ever played, but one of the most blessed pieces of music ever created by humanity. You can just picture angels hovering over the stage and weeping.  Such joy at such a wierd time for the band- go figure.  The whole sequence from Scarlet to Eyes is up there with the very best dead for, what is it, lucidity, coeherence, flow, inspiration.  It is, in a word, PERFECT.  Download now, you'll see!\n\nFor more angels weeping, see St. Louis, Spring 77, set 2 Eyes (sing jerry, sing!). \"how sweet it is\".  By the way, re: my extravagant claim of \"best scarlet ever\", I have a number of them, depending on which one I happen to be listening to, and I'm always looking for another \"best\" one- others include 12-31-76, 11-30-80, 7-13-84, and right now I really like 10-14-80 too!",

      "review_text": "Fabulous music by a renewed band After listening to all of '87 through May, I have decided to complete my journey through Keith's last 50 or odd shows with the band. \n\n \n2nd Set: Apparently the 1st set is Not available in a 'listenable' stream...so the gig starts at \"Scarlet\" for me. It gains a keen head of steam as we approach the 1st jammy section. Credit goes to the drummers' for picking up the slack. Wow, can I just state how much more pleasant it is to listen to a show with this energy compared to the bare-bones Dead that '87 is. The band's providing the unvarying background for Jerry to extend his sonic ambitions through \"Fire.\" The peaks only continue through \"Estimated\" which enters intergalactic territory soon after its break from construct. \"Eyes\" is initially a tad too speedy but Jerry tempers the pace with his melodic singing. Again, it cannnot be stressed enough how much more of a difference the band sounds when its drummers aren't on autopilot. Their caring infuses the band with renewed purpose, so that playing the same 15-20 tunes twice a week does not become a chore/bore/snore.\n\"Drums\" is fine, \"Space\" is sparse tho it becomes evident we're heading towards \"TOO\" around the 3:00 marker. This is a ride worth taking. It's urgent and propulsive if not explosive. The men are in the zone, if \"Wharf\" is not filled with the fanciest of embellishments, it's certainly fluid and tonally accurate. \"Miracle\" commences the transition into 'party music central.' A surprising move into an at first stumbling \"Casey Jones.\" It's ironic because it's one of the simplest songs in the Dead's repertoire, and yet they consistently prove they have no idea to make it sound good/be an over the top rocker, live.\nWe encore with a breezy, airy \"Saturday Night,\"\n that rightfully explodes hen it matters. \nThe set was looking like a 4 1/2r for its consistent high-end, aristocratic performances... however 'Casey Jones' broke that illusion.  Still, undeniably worth hearing.",

      "review_text": "Amazing This was my second dead show, down from Milwaukee tripping for a miracle. My buddy and I got there just in time to get a pair of 16th row seats from a couple of college girls walking thru the lot. We were next to the soundboard. The show started and Dan was scrambling left side of the pa was out. We spotted an unplugged road case and waved him over. During candyman he plugged it in a the sound came to life! My first miracle and a Casey jones. Excellent show first China -Rider since Oct. 1974.",

My bud Mike G. & I were standin\u2019 at the railing on the second level of the \u201cSquare\u201d and I see this girl bringin\u2019 Jerry a tray of beer; shortly after he is doing an interview, before show, like in the 6th row of floor seats; he\u2019s in the middle of the vid and looks up at me & Mikey & points, smiles & goes back to the pre show interview! We flash him a peace sign!I We were SLAMMED! I said Hey Mike, did you see that & he\u2019s like F*** yeah, I did!! The show couldn\u2019t have been better after that!! Went back in December to Indy Convention Center and saw my 2nd and last show, one of Brent\u2019s first shows; I have no words!! Thank you Archive.com for preserving these good times for me and all the other Dead heads!",
