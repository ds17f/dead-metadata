      "review_text": "Lets start over again...this show deserves TWO! The \"Miller Upgrade\" warrants a whole new set of reviews...This show, so critical to so many (I shared the experience of the reviewer on the \"other\" version of long having a cassette of the rebroadcast in 76 or so when the 70s DJ starts it off with \"Hello San Francisco!\"), is an amazingly flawless stream of the fall of 68 at its best.  It proves two things to me:  Bob added something, and Pig (sadly) was not critical to this new era for the boys.  TC, whom I love, DOES end up bringing a great deal to the band, but in Oct 68 it is clear that the toy organ contribution of PP to DS is best left aside (compare Aug Shrine shows to this).  The upbeat versions of StSt are clearly the best, though those of late 70 are close behind.\n\nEnjoy folks, Miller has improved what you didn't think was improvable.  Was a five star before, has to be one now.",

This is a fine show from a very favorite era of mine, but I don't see how so many people think that The Eleven from this night beats out the one from 10/13? This one is good, but something about the next night's performance REALLY grabs me.  I can think of at least 5 Eleven's I'd pick over this one, but we all know how these things are so subjective.

We were celebrating our earlier in the day victory over San Mateo Junior College.\n\nThat the Grateful Dead was the headliner was totally an afterthought, but most of us stayed to gather in their entire set which lasted until well past the 2 a.m. curfew. \n\nThe entire week the SF Bay Area had been draped and ensconsed in the most beautifully perfect weather pattern I have ever experienced -- even to this day. I still count this as one of the most utterly perfect weeks in my life. The crystal clear days and nights were warm and balmy with an unending gentle breeze. The air was soft and caressing to the skin.\n\nThere is a note attached to this show that there was no performance emanated from Blue Ron, but of little note there should be amended that towards the end of the Dead's venture into their nightly featured mania called Feedback, Jimi Hendrix came up on stage and added his howl to the ongoing din.\n\nThis is no lie. I saw it with my own eyes. Jimi came up on stage and played with the Dead. Nobody noticed and nobody said anything. There was no announcement.\n\nAfter countless years of research consisting of reading every record ever written about the Grateful Dead, asking people in the know like Rock Scully, Danny Riskin, Chet Helms, David Gans and David Lemieux, and asking hundreds of various Dead Heads, past and present, apparently, I am the only one who ever saw Jimi actually get up there and play.\n\nI'm not asking you to take my word for it and I surely would like it if someone could corroborate my claim, but it doesn't really matter in the long run. I saw what I saw and I was not stoned or altered, mentally or physically, in any way.\n\nIt happened just as I say it happened...on this night...forty unforgettable years ago.",

Audio quality is excellent.\n\nThe first set is better than the second. This is a classic Dark Star from the classic Dark Star period. The jam is interesting and Jerry delivers great vocals. St. Stephan is the same arrangement as on Aoxomoxoa, with the bells and the wobbly guitar. (They were recording Aoxomoxoa at this time). It, as well as The Eleven, are tight and energetic, with great jamming. The set ends with Death Don\u2019t Have No Mercy, with Jerry at his finest on vocal, with nice guitar work as well. on Death Don\u2019t.\n\nThe Second set starts out well with a good Cryptical>Other One. There\u2019s a somewhat rough transition into New Potato, where absence of any keyboard is noticeable. Nice vocal by Bob. \nThere a somewhat weak Drums followed by an Alligator-ish jam. This is pretty good stuff, but there are better Anthem sets in 1968, with better transitions, particularly February-March and August.\n\nFirst set 5, second set 4.

I had this as being 10-13-68, not 10-12. On the recording I have, the crowd is in a ruckus during the intro and Jerry says \"Everybody relax for christ's sakes; everybody just cool it. Everything's gonna be all right. We're gonna play here until, until we drop.\" The version here and another version uploaded by David Gans have different intros. Can someone help me to place Jerry's comments? The last thing is that my recording ended at the end of NPC. How amazing is the jam that follows? They just nail every f&*%er in the place to the back wall. Unbelievable. With or without Pigpen, this show is top 10 and this Dark Star is top 5.

The problem with improvised music is inspiration and interest. This version of the Other One, and ensuing Cryptical, show the benefits of improvised music, when the musicians are inspired and interested in what they are doing. At that level of music what comes through is the heart of the musicians. Their souls!  You can tell from the music that they are doing this for the music and for humanity. They set out with the highest ideals and intentions, and that gave them an infinite ceiling for what music can be and how it can function. I am getting sidetracked but this type of thing needs to be heard by everyone! This is the best of humanity and America, it should be held up high as an example of human possibility and achievement.

On more than one occasion decades ago I actually found a few parts of this show to be just on the verge of too intense--almost terrifying (The Eleven and The Other One, esp). Jerry certainly knew which buttons to push and sometimes in a show like this he pushed them really, really hard. Being clean and sober now, it is fantastic to go back and hear how good a show like this can still sound. The manipulative/anticipatory power of a transition/set-up like the section from about 1:35 to 1:50 on the Other One can still take one just about anywhere. How special can the music make one feel? This special.",

Those of you who are open to suggestions, I've saved links for a couple other versions which, though not having the amazing sound quality of this show, will still blow you away. These are personal favorites of mine, guaranteed to get all of your psychedelic juices flowing!\nSilver Dollar Fair, Chico, CA:\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd68-11-01.sbd.cotsman.18100.sbeok.shnf/gd68-11-01d1t01.shn     for the Other One\n\nDream Bowl, Vallejo, CA:\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd1969-02-21.sbd.miller.111780.flac16/gd69-02-21d1t05.flac      for The Eleven \n\n-In both cases you need to crank up the volume to get all the detail in the recording.",
