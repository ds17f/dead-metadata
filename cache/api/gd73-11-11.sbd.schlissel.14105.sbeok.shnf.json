The Dark Star is magnificent - long, jazzy and intricate.  The mind left body jam is bliss.  The Eyes is one of the best they ever played, maybe even the best (from an Eyes-aholic).  The China Doll is poignant.\n\nGET THIS SHOW!!!  Kick off your shoes, tip the recliner back, smoke 'em if you got 'em, and get ready for your journey...",

Likely the best version of 1973 (well, there's 3/28, check it out) and shows the band at their peak in 1973. The jams go to some very cosmic places with lots of thematic interplay. And the Eyes that follows is every bit as special, into a heartbreaking China Doll. This was the last night of 3 at Winterland, and with Uncle John and Bid You Goodnight for encores, I'd say they got their money's worth tonight! A must have 1973 show. \nDr. Flashback ;-)",

Then one of the most adventurous and greatest versions of Dark Star leads to a Mind Left Body Jam that is the most intense and focused version that I have ever heard. The Eyes of the World that follows is phenomenal and deserves to rank right up at the top with the likes of 5/7/77 & 6/18/74. A minor tragedy that the middle had to be patched, but it is basically in the verse and the sound returns to its otherwise STELLAR level. A lovely China Doll caps it off.",

One of the best Dark stars, imo, which runs the gambit from cacophonous, to trippy, to happy and all points inbetween, right into a mesmerizing eyes. \nIn the end, all that should be said is that if you havent heard this show, you are doing your ears an injustice.",

There's a long stretch after the verse where nothing seems to be happening, and then they bust out of it.  The MLB jam is more like, \"Your mind has re-entered your body!\"  It's a much more rocking version than 12/2/73 (DP14), but that version is so gorgeous it's beyond words.  The Eyes utterly rips.  I'd say this is a 4 1/2 star show if 12/2 is a 5.\n\nThe section with the AUD patch sounds just as good as the rest of it, except you can hear the audience a little.

      "review_text": "a few weak points that haven't been addressed... 25 reviews, all but 2 are 5 star ratings. I expected perfection. There certainly are some wonderful things about this show, but I have to speak out about some weak elements, lest anyone else rushes to download and uses up time and bandwith based on the glowing reviews, without fully knowing what they're getting into:\n\nThere's a weird tape cut at the end of Promised Land into Bertha. The energy level rises in Bertha, things start to cook... but Bobby's vocals are ragged.  By Greatest Story, Bob's voice is really sounding strained. Donna is trying to harmonize, but that just makes it worse. Sugaree is nice. Black throated wind suffers from Bob's strained vocals again.  \nLater we're off to El Paso... and something strange happens... Bobby's voice is FINE! This song is in his range, his singing is comfortable, expressive, and assured. Why does he strain and holler through songs when he can sing like this? Keith also steps out with some energetic piano.\nRamble on Rose is okay, Phil (who has been doing the occasional nice run) drops some NICE bombs coming out of the solo. Jerry's playing is lovely and expressive. Bobby McGee is cool too, with Bobby McWeir's voice just fine again, and Keith doing some cool saloon-style piano. China/Rider is mellow, but good. Jerry lays way back in the transition, and Bob's guitar work (which is crystal clear in the mix) is nice. Me & My Uncle is good, thankfully Bobby has been sticking with the cowboy songs that are in his vocal range. Lucy is fine, but I didn't think it was anything special. WRS/Let It Grow suffers from Bobby's strained vocals again, Jerry's playing is quick and jazzy through the L.I.G. jam, and really does some mindbending work, but I'll be looking for a version where Bob's voice sounds better.\n\nA lot has been said about the second set, and I mostly agree. Big River hasn't been mentioned much, but it's fantastic. Jerry does some nice work-he seems to have some equipment trouble during his second solo, and lays out for a bit while Bob and Keith do some really energetic vamping and the tune just catches fire coming back into the final chorus. \nThe Dark Star is incredible, and Eyes is too... although the way Phil had been 'hinting' all night, I was really ready for him to tear up the 3rd vamp section where he often 'solos'- and he sounds ready to do it, doing some cool runs leading into the section... but Jerry deedles a bit like HE's going to take one... and then Phil just lays out. There is some weird tape source patching kind of stuff happening here too, and a couple of the transistions to the minor key are shaky.\nSugar Magnolia suffers from Bob's voice, reaching its nadir at the end with a bunch of screaming and caterwauling and carrying on... maybe you had to be there.\nI was scared of Uncle John's Band being ruined by Bobby's voice, but he's pretty quiet, and Phil steps to the mic, which is always nice. Johnny B. Goode, a nothing special tune with strained vocals again.\nAnd We Bid You Goodnight is great, Bob tries to end the show with a 'thankyouallgoodnight' but Jerry sets it off, as if posessed by the holy ghost, doing some really cool gospel style lead singing over some nice harmony singing, with Donna doing a lovely job and Bob singing comfortably.\n\nI don't want to sound like the grumpy guy who has to rain on the parade of everyone's favorite show, but there are some weak points that I didn't think had been addressed in the reviews thus far. Overall I do think this is a good show, and the sound quality and mix are fantastic. I'll probably commit taper's blasphemy and chop up this show to fit second set highlights onto a single disc, maybe look for a better '73 first set.\npeace.",

This occurs in the last 30 seconds or so of promised land. It seems like the whole band suddenly realized..oh yea, we are playin a show. Jerrys voice on bertha is angelic. Unfortunetely this was during bobbys second attempt at puberty and his vocals are inconsistent. Berthaoh jeez. Greatest story, much better. \n\n Jerry by now has dipped around the bend and is waving from the shadows behind the moon. Greatest story has always felt that way to me. Jerry is almost extending, hmmif youve seen Donnie Darko, his notes are like that plasma fluid thing. I dont know, I can feel it, I can see it, but Ill be damned if I can explain it. Donna isnt really on, but she doesnt kill this show. The Greatest story is nothing short of awesome. Reviews of bobbys voice being off are true, but did you listen to what Jerry is doing. Just push the voice away. A nice sugaree, an eh BT Wind. A freaking beautiful To lay me down.freaking beautiful. Jerrys voice has the edge of 89 with the clarity of 68just incredible. And when Donna isnt trying to do Janis screams she can add nicely, which she does here. \n\nOne thing that always irks me abit is when someone says they only really like Jerry tunes and then use that as an explanation for why they dont like a song.  For example El Paso. If you dont dig country thats one thing, but while not sung or arranged by Jerry he ripped this tune numerous times over the years.b/c he loved playing it. Sometimes Im not into a song for awhile and then I will hear Jerry completely absorbed in a version and I find a way to love it. This El Paso falls into said class. The man is simply having a blast runnin scales over it. Great version. Ramble on Rose is never anything but great. Just an impeccably well written song. Bobby McGee, a song that got played about 100 times in 2 years, and then 20 times over the next 22 they were really cooking on this one. Keith starts to settle in nicely during this. It very interesting listening to this show from the perspective of knowing the ending. The first set is almost like they are all getting reaquanted with one another and then finally with China Cat>Rider all the pleasantries and introductions are over and its down to business. Phil bombs, watch out! One of my favorite China Cats hands down, its really fantastic, super duper even. Turn on a dime time starts now and does not stop, well really for the next 2 weekslol what a band. Very strong me and my uncle. Loose Lucy is middle of road, I love this tune but this is not one of the better ones out there. WRP>Let it GrowBobbys vocals arent the best they ever were but they are fine here. Jerry rips LIG apart, sick version. The \u00bd Step opener is what it was then, underdeveloped. \n\nThe next hour of music ranks among the best the band ever played imo. It starts out with a crumpkickity Big River. Yea I made up that word, so what. To review this Dark Star the way Id like would require a whole page of its own so I will just say it definitely ranks high. Its not my favorite, top 10, sometimes, top 20 for sure. I guess it depends on the week.  It doesnt wobble in wind as much as some from 72 and isnt as full of chops as in 74, and its not like many other 73 versions. Include the MLB jam and it jumps up to the higher ranks, include the whole segment and its historic music. Its great-period. \n\nFor my money this is the eyes I would want. Its structure is brilliant, Keith and Bob both play major roles, its tight and lose. There is, as mentioned a fumble changing into a minor scale in the breakdown, but I have found that when they didnt have one or two of them in 73 74 they usually werent pushing the limits, more of a play through. All the big name eyes have a miscue if you look for them. What sets this apart for me is the interplay and the mix. The mix is perfectperfect. They are bouncing off each other in a very special way. I wish I was listening to it right now so I could include a few time signatures, but I am at work with up to Big river only. An inspiring china doll segued into just right. \n\nAfter that segment the rest of the show is nothing special. Just some playing around really and Bobs voice comes back to sink Sugar Mags. There are a few cuts and patches here and there, notably a seemingly damaged sbd reel for a bit of eyes. However I kind of like the texture it produces..any longer would be no good, but its just right. \nSound 4/5\nShow 7.9/10\nSet II 9.5/10\n\np.s.

Then we clapped, screamed \"MORE\" and stomped the floor simultaneously, in unison and as one unified body for 25 solid, nonstop minutes. Very few of the original crowd left. We stood our ground because we wanted to bid them a goodnight.\n\nAll of a sudden, at the smiling crescendo of our final vociferous demand, the house lights came down and the band donned the stage for a double encore.\n\nWhen it was done a fully satiated crowd funneled out through Winterland's portals into the dark and quiet night. There was every bit the evidence that we were all going straight home to bed for, after a donnybrook like that, any further merry-making would have been superfluous.",

Primal dead and the second set feel lives deep in this jam, reaching over 35 minutes and spanning WAY larger territory than most i have heard. Less in your face than the 69' dark stars, this one turns into a fusion jam about two thirds in that will go on to foreshadow the magnificent jazzy jams that would perfect themselves in 1974. Jerry twinges Stella Blue and drives the jam towards a more cohesive, melodic jam.\nI can't say enough about this second set, or that beautiful Dark Star.",
